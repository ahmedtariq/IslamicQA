1,1,4,"In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful: Praise be to God, is a predicate of a nominal clause, the content of which is intended to extol God 
[by Stating that]: He possesses the praise of all creatures, or that He [alone] deserves their praise. God 
is a proper noun for the One truly worthy of worship; Lord of all Worlds, that is, [He is] the One Who 
owns all of creation: humans, jinn, angels, animals and others as well, each of which may be referred to 
as a ‘world’; one says ‘the world of men, or ‘world of the jinn’ etc. This plural form with the yd’ and the 
nun [sc. ‘dlamin] is used to denote, predominantly, cognizant beings ( ulu him). The expression [' dlamin ] 
relates to [the term] ‘sign’ (‘alamo), since it is an indication of the One that created it. The Compassionate, the Merciful: that is to say, the One who possesses ‘mercy’, which means to 
want what is good for those who deserve it. Matter of the Day of Judgement: that is, [the day of] requite, the Day of Resurrection. The reason 
for the Specific mention [of the Day of Judgement] is that the mastery of none shall appear on that Day 
except that of God, may He be exalted, as is indicated by [God’s words] ‘Whose is the Kingdom today?’ 
‘God’s’ [Q. 40:16] (if one reads it malik [as opposed to malik], then this signifies that He has possession 
of the entire affair on the Day of Resurrection, or else that He is ever described by this [expression], in 
the same way as [He is described as] ‘Forgiver of sin ( ghafir al-dhanb). Thus, one can validly take it as an 
adjective of a definite noun).","In the name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful . All praise be to Allah[1], the Lord[2] of the worlds[3], . the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful[4], . Master[5] of the Day of Judgment.","[1] Allah is God’s most unique name.
 [2] The Arabic term ""rabb"" (translated as ""Lord"") includes all of the following meanings: ""owner, master, ruler, controller, sustainer, provider, guardian and caretaker.""
 [3] ""the worlds"" means mankind, jinn, and all that exists. . [4] Ar-Rahmān and Ar-Raheem are two names of Allah: Rahmān is used only to describe Allah, while raheem might be used to describe a human as well. Rahmān carries a wider meaning - merciful to all creation. Justice is a part of this mercy. Raheem includes the concept of specialty - especially merciful to the believers. Forgiveness is a part of this mercy. In addition, Rahmān is adjectival, referring to an attribute of Allah and is part of His essence. Raheem is verbal, indicating what He does: i.e., bestowing and implementing mercy. . [5] Other meanings for ""Mālik"": Sovereign, Owner, etc."
1,5,6,"You [alone] we worship, and You [alone] we ask for help: that is to say, we reserve worship for You 
[alone] by way of acknowledging Your Oneness ( tawhid) and so on, and we ask for [Your] assistance in 
worship and in other things. Guide us to the straight path: that is, ‘show us the way to it’. This is substituted by:","You alone we worship, and You alone we ask for help. . Guide us to the straight path,",
1,7,7,"the path of those whom You have favoured, with guidance (from alladhina together with its rela¬ 
tive clause is substituted by [ghayri l-maghdubi ‘alayhim]) not [ the path] of those againtt whom there is 
wrath, namely, the Jews, and nor of those who are attray, namely, the Christians. The subtle meaning im¬ 
plied by this substitution is that the guided ones are neither the Jews nor the Christians. But God knows 
beSt what is right, and to Him is the Return and the [final] Resort. May God bless our lord Muhammad 
(5), his Family and Companions and grant them everlasting peace. Sufficient is God for us; an excellent 
Guardian is He. There is no power and no Strength save in God, the High, the Tremendous.

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","the path of those whom You have blessed[6]; not of those who incurred Your Wrath[7], or of those who went astray[8].","[6] The way of the Prophets and those who follow them.
 [7] Those who know the Truth and do not follow it, like the Jews.
 [8] Those who are ignorant of the Truth and follow misguidance, like the Christians."
2,1,2,"Alifldm mim: God knows best what He means by these [letters]. T hat, meaning, this, Book, which Muhammad (s) recites, in it there is no doubt, no uncertainty, 
that it is from God (the negation [la raybafihi ] is the predicate of dhalika; the use of the demonstrative 
here is intended to glorify [the Book]). A guidance (huda is a second predicate, meaning that it [the 
Book] guides’), for the God-fearing, namely, those that tend towards piety by adhering to commands 
and avoiding things prohibited, thereby guarding themselves from the Fire;","Alif Lām Mīm[1]. . This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for the righteous[2],","[1] Allah knows the meaning of these disjointed Arabic letters. This bears testimony to the inimitable nature of the Qur’an and its divine source. . [2] Literally, ""those who have taqwā,"" i.e., who have piety, righteousness, fear and love of Allah, and who take great care of avoiding His displeasure."
2,3,5,"who believe in, that is, who accept the truth of, the Unseen, what is hidden from them of the Resur¬ 
rection, Paradise and the Fire; and maintain the prayer, that is to say, who perform it giving it its proper 
due; and of what We have provided them, that is, of what we have beStowed upon them, expend, in 
obedience to God; and who believe in what has been revealed to you, namely, the Qur’an; and what was revealed 
before you, that is, the Torah, the GoSJjel and other [scriptures]; and of the Hereafter, they are certain, 
that is, they know [it is real]. Those, as described in the way mentioned, are upon guidance from their Lord, those are the ones 
that will prosper, that is, who will succeed in entering Paradise and be saved from the Fire.","those who believe in the unseen, establish prayer[3], and spend out of what We[4] have provided for them, . and those who believe in what has been sent down to you [O Prophet] and in what was sent down before you[5], and in the Hereafter they believe with certainty. . It is they who are upon guidance from their Lord, and it is they who are successful.","[3] At its proper times and fulfill its all conditions. [4] ""We"" in reference to Allah in the Qur’anic verses is necessarily understood to denote grandeur and power. . [5] i.e., the Taurāt (Torah) and the Injīl (Gospel), etc."
2,6,7,"As for the disbelievers, the likes of Abu Jahl, Abu Lahab and such; alike it is for them whether you 
have warned them or have not warned them, they do not believe, as God knows very well, so do not 
hope that they will believe (read a-andhartahum pronouncing both hamzas, or by not pronouncing the 
second, making it an alif instead, and inserting an alif between the one not pronounced and the other 
one, or leaving [this insertion]; al-indhar [‘warning’] is to give knowledge of something, and simultane¬ 
ously instil an element of fear). God has set a seal on their hearts, impressing on them and making certain that no good enters 
them; and on their hearing, [in which He has] deposited something so that they cannot profit from the 
truth they hear; and on their eyes is a covering, that is, a veil so that they do not see the truth; and for 
them there will be a mighty chastisement, that is, intense and everlasting.","Those who persist in disbelief, it is the same whether you warn them or not, they will not believe. . Allah has sealed their hearts and their hearing, and their sight is covered[6]; and for them there will be a great punishment.","[6] A covering preventing from discerning guidance, as a result of their arrogance and persistence in sin."
2,8,16,"The following was revealed concerning the hypocrites: and some people there are who say, ‘We 
believe in God and the LaSt Day’, that is, in the Day of Resurrection because it is the very la St day; but 
they are not believers (the [plural] import of man [in man yaqiil, ‘who says’] is taken into account here, 
as expressed by a pronoun [hum] that expresses this [plural] meaning). I 7 i ey would deceive God and the believers, by manifesting the opposite of the unbelief they hide, so 
that they can avoid His rulings in this world; and only themselves they deceive ( yukhadiun ), for the evil 
consequences of their deception will rebound upon them, as they are disgraced in this world when God 
makes known to His Prophet what they are hiding, and they will be punished in the Hereafter; and they 
are not aware, and they do not know that they are actually deceiving themselves ( mukhadaa [although 
a third verbal form, from khada’a] actually denotes a one-way acftion, such as [when one says] ‘dqabtu al- 
lissa, ‘I punished the thief’ [using the third verbal form ‘ aqaba ]; the mention of‘God’ in [this Statement] 
is for [rhetorical] effecft; a variant reading [for wa-ma yukhadi’una] has wa-ma yakhda’una). In their hearts is a sickness: doubt and hypocrisy, which ails their hearts, debilitating them; 
and God has increased their sickness with what He has revealed in the Qur’an, since they disbelieve 
it; and there awaits them a painful chastisement because they used to lie (read yukadhdhibun to 
imply [that they used to call] the Prophet of God [a liar], or yakdhibiin to imply their [mendacity

when] saying ‘we believe’). When it is said to them, that is, these latter, ‘Do not spread corruption in the land’, through un¬ 
belief and hindering [people from] faith, They say, ‘We are only putting things right’, that is, ‘we are not 
engaging in corruption’. God, exalted be He, refutes them, saying: Truly ( a-la, ‘truly’, is for alerting), intended emphatically, they are the agents of corruption, but 
they perceive, this, not. When it is said to them, ‘Believe as the people believe’, that is, as the Companions of the Prophet 
(5), They say, ‘Shall we believe as fools believe?’, that is, as the ignorant do? No we do not follow their 
way. The exalted One refutes them, saying: Truly, they are the foolish ones, but they know, this, not. When they meet ( laqu is actually laquyii, but the damma has been omitted, being too cumber¬ 
some for pronunciation; likewise the ya [is omitted], because it is unvocalised and is followed by a wdw); 
those who believe, they say, ‘We believe’; but when they go apart, away from them and return, to their 
devils, their leaders, they say, ‘We are with you, in religion; we were only mocking, them [the believers] 
by feigning belief. God [Himself] mocks them, requiting them for their mockery, leaving them, that is, giving them 
recite, in their insolence, that is, in their transgressing the limits of unbelief; bewildered, wavering, in 
perplexity ( ya’mahun is a circumstantial qualifier). Those are they who have bought error for guidance, that is, they have exchanged the latter for the 
former; so their commerce has not profited them, that is to say, they have gained nothing from it, indeed, 
they have loSt, because their destination is the Fire, made everlasting for them; nor are they guided, in 
what they did.","There are some people[7] who say, “We believe in Allah and the Last Day,” whereas they are not believers. . They seek to deceive Allah and those who believe, while they deceive none but themselves, but they do not realize. . In their hearts is a sickness[8], and Allah increased their sickness, and they will have a painful punishment for their persistent lying. . When it is said to them, “Do not spread corruption in the land,” they say, “We are only reformers.” . Indeed, it is they who spread corruption, but they do not realize it. . When it is said to them, “Believe as the people have believed,” they say, “Shall we believe as the fools[9] have believed?” Indeed, it is they who are the fools, but they do not know. . When they meet those who believe, they say, “We believe.” But when they are alone with their evil ones[10], they say, “We are certainly with you; we were only mocking.” . Allah will mock them[11] and prolong them to wander blindly in their transgression. . They are those who purchased misguidance for guidance, but their trade was profitless, and they were not guided.","[7] i.e., the hypocrites. . [8] The ""sickness"" mentioned here includes doubt, hypocrisy, arrogance and disbelief. . [9] The hypocrites were considering the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) to be fools, whereas they themselves were fools. . [10] i.e., their leaders in evil and disbelief. . [11] Allah mocks them in response to their mocking Muslims."
2,17,20,"Their likeness, the way they are in their hypocrisy, is as the likeness of one who kindled, that is, 
[one who] lit afire in darkness, and when it illumined all about him, so that he is able to see, and to feel 
warm and secure from those he feared, God took away their light, extinguishing it (the plural pronoun 
[in nurihim] takes into account the [plural] import of alladhi); and left them in darkness, unable to see, 
what is around them, confused as to the way, in fear; likewise are those who have found [temporary] 
security by professing faith, but who will meet with terror and punishment upon death; these [laSt] are: deaf, to the truth, so that they cannot hear it and accept it; dumb, mute as regards goodness, 
unable to s^eak of it; and, blind, to the path of guidance, so that they cannot perceive it; they shall not 
return, from error. Or, the likeness of them is as a cloudburst, that is, [the likeness of them is] as people are during 
rain ( ka-sayyib: the term is originally sayyub, from [the verb] sdba,yasubu, meaning ‘it came down); out 
of the heaven, out of the clouds, in which clouds is darkness, layer upon layer, and thunder, the angel in 
charge of them [sc. the clouds]; it is also said that this [thunder] is actually the sound of his voice; and 
lightning, the flash caused by his voice which he uses to drive them — they, the people under the rain, 
put their fingers, that is, their fingertips, in their ears again SI, because of, the thunderclaps, the violent 
sound of thunder, in order not to hear it, cautious of, fearful of, death, if they were to hear it. Similar is 
the case with these: when the Qur’an is revealed, in which there is mention of the unbelief that is like 
darkness, the threat of punishment that is like the sound of thunder, and the clear arguments that are like 
the clear lightning, they shut their ears in order not to hear it and thereby incline towards [true] faith and 
abandon their religion, which for them would be death; and God encompasses the disbelievers in both 
knowledge and power, so they cannot escape Him. The lightning well-nigh, almost, snatches away their sight, that is, takes it away swiftly; whenso¬ 
ever it gives them light, they walk in it, in its light; and when the darkness is over them, they Stop, that 
is, they “Stand ftill: a simile of the perturbation that the Qur’anic arguments cause in their hearts, and of 
their acknowledging the truths of what they love to hear and recoiling from what they detect; had God

willed, He would have taken away their hearing and their sight, that is, the exterior faculty, in the same 
way that He took away their inner one; Truly, God has power over all things, [that] He wills, as for ex¬ 
ample, His taking away of the above-mentioned.","Their likeness is that of someone who kindles a fire. When it illuminates all around him, Allah takes away their light, leaving them in utter darkness, unable to see[12]. . Deaf, dumb, and blind; they will not return [to the straight path]. . Or like a downpour from the sky accompanied by darkness, thunder, and lightning. They put their fingers into their ears out of thunderclaps, for fear of death. But Allah encompasses the disbelievers. . The lightning almost snatches away their eyesight. Every time lightning[13] strikes, they walk in its light, but when it becomes dark, they stand still. If Allah had willed, He would have taken away their hearing and their sight; for Allah is Most Capable of all things.","[12] This is the situation of the hypocrites in the darkness of doubt and disbelief, not seeing the truth and guidance. . [13] The parable of lightning is that of the light of the Qur’an."
2,21,22,"O people, ofMecca, worship, profess the oneness of, your Lord Who created you, made you when 
you were nothing, and created those that were before you; so that you may be fearful, of His punish¬ 
ment by worshipping Him [Walla, ‘so that’, is essentially an optative, but when ^oken by God it denotes 
an affirmative), He Who assigned to you, created [for you], the earth for a couch, like a carpet that is laid out, 
neither extremely hard, nor extremely soft so as to make it impossible to £tand firm upon it; and heaven 
for an edifice, like a roof; and sent down from the heaven water, wherewith He brought forth, all types 
of, fruits for your provision; so set not up compeers to God, that is partners in worship, while you know 
that He is the Creator, that you create not and that only One that creates can be God.","O people, worship your Lord, Who created you and those before you, so that you may become righteous; . He Who made the earth a resting place for you, and the sky a canopy; and sends down rain from the sky, and brings forth fruits thereby as a provision for you.

verses); and call your witnesses, those other gods that you worship, besides God, that is, other than Him, 
so that it can be seen, if you are truthful, in [your claim] that Muhammad (s) speaks it from himself. So 
do this, for you are also fluent speakers of Arabic like him. When they could not do this, God said: And if you do not, do what was mentioned because you are incapable, and you will not (a par¬ 
enthetical statement), that is, never [will you be able to], because of its inimitability, 1 then fear, through

mentioned, unlike the fires of this world that burn with wood and similar materials; prepared, and made 
ready, for disbelievers, so that they are punished in it (this [phrase, uiddat li’l-kafirina, ‘prepared for 
disbelievers’] is either a new sentence or a sustained circumstantial qualifier).","If you are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down upon Our slave[15], then produce a chapter like it and call upon your helpers other than Allah, if you are truthful. . But if you did not do it, and you can never do it; then beware of the Fire whose fuel will be people and stones, which is prepared for the disbelievers.",[15] “Our servant” is referring to Muhammad (ﷺ).

eous deeds, such as the obligatory and supererogatory [rituals], that theirs shall be Gardens, of trees, 
and habitations, underneath which, that is, underneath these trees and palaces, rivers run (tajri min 
tahtihal-anharu ), that is, there are waters in it ( al-nahr is the place in which water flows [and is so 
called] because the water carves [yanhar] its way through it; the reference to it as ‘running’ is figurative);

gardens, they shall say, ‘This is what, that is, the like of what we were provided with before’, that is, be¬

impurities; therein they shall abide: dwelling therein forever, neither perishing nor departing therefrom. 
And when the Jews said, ‘Why does God Strike a similitude about flies, where He says, And if a fly should 
rob them of anything [Q. 22:73] and about a Slider, where He says, As the likeness of the ipider [Q. 29:41]: 
what does God want with these vile creatures? God then revealed the following:","And give glad tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens under which rivers flow.

ers, they say, ‘What did God desire by this for a similitude?’ ( mathalan is a Specification, meaning, ‘by 
this similitude’; ma is an interrogative of rejection and is the subject; dha means alladhi, whose relative 
clause contains its predicate, in other words, ‘what use is there in it?’). God then responds to them saying: 
Thereby, that is, by this similitude, He leads many adray, from the truth on account of their disbelieving 
in it, and thereby He guides many, believers on account of their belief in it; and thereby He leads none 
adray except the wicked, those that rejecft obedience to Him. Those such as. He has described, break the covenant of God, the contract He made with them in 
the [revealed] Books to belief in Muhammad (s), after its solemn binding, after it has been confirmed 
with them, and such as cut what God has commanded should be joined, of belief in the Prophet, of 
kinship and other matters (an [in the phrase an yusala, ‘that it be joined’] substitutes for the pronoun 
[suffixed] in bihi [of the preceding words ma amara Llahu bihi, ‘that which God has commanded’]); and 
such as do corruption in the land, by way of their transgressing and impeding faith, they, the ones thus 
described, shall be the losers, since, they shall end up in the Fire, made everlasting for them.","Allah is not ashamed to give a similitude of a mosquito or even something less [significant][16]. As for those who believe, they know that this is the truth from their Lord; but those who disbelieve say, “What does Allah mean by this similitude?” He causes many to go astray thereby and guides many thereby, but He causes none to go astray except the evildoers – . those who break the covenant of Allah after it has been ratified, sever bonds that Allah has commanded to be maintained[17], and spread corruption in the land.

2,28,29,"How do you, people of Mecca, disbelieve in God, when you were dead, semen inside loins, and He 
gave you life, in the womb and in this world by breathing Spirit into you (the interrogative here is either 
intended to provoke amazement at their [persistent] unbelief deSpite the evidence established, or intended 
as a rebuke); then He shall make you dead, after your terms of life are completed, then He shall give you 
life, at the Resurrection, then to Him you shall be returned!, after resurrection, whereupon He shall requite 
you according to your deeds; and He States, as proof of the Resurrection, when they denied it: He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth, that is, the earth and all that is in it, so that 
you may benefit from and learn lessons from it; then, after creating the earth, He turned to, that is. He 
made His objeCt, heaven and levelled them (fa-sawwahunna: the pronoun [- hunna] refers to ‘heaven’, 
since, it [heaven] is implicit in the import of the sentence attributed to it [the pronoun]), that is to say, He 
made them thus, as [He says] in another verse, [fa-qadahunna ] so He determined them [Q. 41:12]) seven 
heavens and He has knowledge of all things, in their totality and in their individual detail, so do you not

you are, also has the power to bring you back [after death]?","How can you disbelieve in Allah, when you were lifeless then He gave you life, then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you back to life again, then to Him you will be returned? .

2,30,33,"And, mention, O Muhammad (s), when your Lord said to the angels, ‘I am appointing on earth a 
vicegerent’, who shall aCt as My deputy, by implementing My rulings therein — and this [vicegerent] was 
Adam; They said, ‘What, will You appoint therein one who will do corruption therein, through diso¬ 
bedience, and shed blood, spilling it through killing, juft as the progeny of the jinn did, for they used to 
inhabit it, but when they became corrupted God sent down the angels again,ft them and they were driven

Glory and Praise be to You”, and sandify You?’, that is, ‘We exalt You as transcendent above what does

exalted be He, said, ‘Assuredly, I know what you know not’, of the benefits of making Adam a vicegerent 
and of the faCt that among his progeny will be the obedient and the transgressor, and justice will prevail 
between them. They said, ‘God will never create anything more noble in His eyes than us nor more 
knowledgeable, since we have been created before it and have seen what it has not seen. God then created 
Adam from the surface of the earth ( adim al-ard [adim literally means ‘skin’]), taking a handful of all its 
colours and mixing it with different waters, then made him upright and breathed into him the Spirit and 
he thus became a living being with senses, after having been inanimate. And He taught Adam the names, that is, the names of things named, all of them, by placing 
knowledge of them into his heart; then He presented them, these names, the majority of which con¬ 
cerned intellectual beings, to the angels and said, to them in reproach, ‘Now tell Me, inform Me, the 
names of these, things named, if you Tpeak truly’, in your claim that I would not create anything more 
knowledgeable than you, or that you are more deserving of this vicegerency; the response to the condi¬ 
tional sentence is intimated by what precedes it.

he named each thing by its appellation and mentioned the wisdom behind its creation; And when he 
had told them their names He, exalted, said, in rebuke, ‘Did I not tell you that I know the Unseen in

2,34,39,"And, mention, when We said to the angels, ‘Prostrateyourselves to Adam’, a prostration that is a 
bow of salutation; so they prostrated themselves, except Iblis, the father of the jinn, who was among the 
angels, he refused, to proStrate, and disdained, became proud and said, I am better than he [Q. 7:12]; and 
so he became one of the disbelievers, according to God’s knowledge. And We said, Adam, dwell (anta, ‘you’ [of ‘dwell you’] here reiterates the concealed pronoun [of 
the person of the verb uskun], so that it [ wa-zawjuk ] maybe made a supplement to it); and your wife. 
Eve ( Hawwa j — who was created from his left rib — in the Garden, and eat thereof, of its food, ease- 
fully, of anything without restrictions, where you desire; but do not come near this tree, to eat from it, 
and this was wheat or a vine or something else, 2 left you be, become, evildoers’, that is, transgressors. Then Satan, Iblis, caused them to slip, he caused them to be removed (fa-azallahuma : a variant 
reading has fa-azalahuma\ he caused them to be away from it) therefrom, that is, from the Garden, when 
he said to them, ‘Shall I point you to the tree of eternity’ [cf. Q. 20:120], and swore to them by God that he 
was only giving good advice to them, and so they ate of it; and brought them out of what they were in, of 
bliss; and We said, ‘Go down, to earth, both of you and all those comprised by your seed; some of you, of 
your progeny, an enemy to the other, through your wronging one another; and in the earth a dwelling, 
a place of settlement, shall be yours, and enjoyment, of whatever of its vegetation you may enjoy, for a 
while’, [until] the time your terms [of life] are concluded. Thereafter Adam received certain words from his Lord, with which He inspired him (a variant 
reading [of Adamu] has accusative Adama and nominative kalimatu ), meaning they [the words] came to 
him, and these were [those of] the verse Lord, we have wronged ourselves [Q. 7:23], with which he sup¬ 
plicated, and He relented to him, that is, He accepted his repentance; truly He is the Relenting, to His 
servants, the Mercifid, to them. We said, ‘Go down from it, from the Garden, all together (He has repeated this [phrase qulna 
ihbitu ] in order to supplement it with), yet (fa-imma: the nun of the conditional particle in [‘if’] has been 
assimilated with the extra ma) there shall come to you from Me guidance, a Book and a prophet, and 
whoever follows My guidance, believing in me and performing deeds in obedience of Me, no fear shall 
befall them, neither shall they grieve, in the Hereafter, since they will be admitted into Paradise. As for the disbelievers who deny Our signs, Our Books, those shall be the inhabitants of the Fire, 
abiding therein’, enduring perpetually, neither perishing nor exiting therefrom.","And when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam[18],” and they prostrated except Iblīs[19]; he refused and was arrogant, and was one of the disbelievers. . We said, “O Adam, dwell in Paradise, you and your wife; and eat pleasantly from wherever you wish, but do not approach this tree, or else you will both become the wrongdoers.” . Then Satan tempted them and drove them out of the state they were in, and We said, “Go down [to the earth], as enemies to one another. You will have abode on earth and provision for an appointed time[20].” . Then Adam received some words[21] from his Lord, and He accepted his repentance. He is the Accepter of repentance, the Most Merciful. . We said, “Go down all of you from here[22]! Then when My guidance comes to you; whoever follows My guidance, will have no fear, nor will they grieve. . But those who disbelieve and reject Our signs, they are the people of the Fire; they will abide therein forever.”","[18] This prostration was done in obedience to Allah, out of respect, not worship.

2 No consensus seems to exist in Muslim exegetical literature on the exadt nature of‘the tree of knowledge of good and evil’ of 
Genesis 2:9ff. The tree is variously identified as a palm-tree, a fig tree, or not a tree at all, but a vine or a wheat Stalk (Ibn Kathir, 
Qisas, 2ofi; Baydawl, Anwar, 1, 54). With regard to its being identified with vine or wheat, confusion tends to arise because of the 
Arabic word shajara which, although is most frequently used to denote ‘a tree’, can also mean any plant that ‘breaks out’ ( shajara ) 
with branches shooting upwards or growing along the ground. Fakhr al-Din al-Razi argues for the plausibility of this Qur’anic 
shajara as being a ‘wheat Stalk’ by the analogy of Jonah’s ‘gourd tree’ ( shajaratin min yaqtin Q. 36:146). He points out that the tact 
that gourd grows along the ground does not preclude its being described as a shajara by the Qur’an (see al-Razi, Mafatih, II.i, 6, sub 
Q. 2:35). The English translation here has retained ‘tree’ throughout to allow clearly for the Biblical allusion.

for which you should show gratitude by being obedient to Me; and fulfil My covenant, that which I took 
from you, that you believe in Muhammad (s), and I shall fulfil your covenant, that which I gave to you, 
that you shall be rewarded for this with Paradise; and be in awe of Me, fear Me and not anyone else when 
you have abandoned belief in him [the Prophet]. And believe in what I have revealed, of the Qur’an, confirming that which is with you, of the 
Torah, by its agreement with it, in rested: to [affirmation of] God’s Oneness and prophethood; and be 
not the fir ft to disbelieve in it, from among the People of the Scripture, for those who will come after 
you will depend on you and so you will bear their sins. And do not sell, exchange. My signs, those that 
relate to the description of Muhammad (s) in your Book; for a small price, for a trivial and temporary 
affair of this world; that is to say, do not suppress this for fear of losing what you hope to earn from lowly 
individuals among you; and fear Me, and none other in this matter. And do not obscure, confuse, the truth, that I have revealed to you, with falsehood, that you fab¬ 
ricate; and do not conceal the truth, the description of Muhammad (s), wittingly, that is, knowing it to 
be the truth. And establish prayer, and pay the alms, and bow with those that bow, that is, pray with those 
who pray, Muhammad (s) and his Companions: this was revealed concerning their religious scholars, 
who used to say to their kin from among the Muslims, ‘Stay firm upon the religion of Muhammad (s), 
for it is the truth’. Will you bid others to piety, to belief in Muhammad (s), and forget yourselves, neglecting your¬ 
selves and not bidding them to the same, while you recite the Book?, in which there is the threat of 
chastisement, if what you do contradicts what you say. Do you not understand? the evil nature of your 
acftions, that you might then repent? (the sentence about ‘forgetting’ constitutes the [syntactical] locus of 
the interrogative of disavowal). Seek help, ask for assistance in your affairs, in patience, by restraining the soul in the face of 
that which it dislikes; and prayer. The singling out of this for mention is a way of emphasising its great 
importance; in one hadith, [it is Stated], ‘When something bothered the Prophet (s), he would immedi¬ 
ately resort to prayer’; it is said that the address here is to the Jews: when greed and desire for leadership 
became impediments to their faith, they were enjoined to forbearance, which constituted faSting and 
prayer, since, the former Stems from luSt and the latter yields humility and negates pride. For it, prayer, 
is grievous, burdensome, except to the humble, those that are at peace in obedience, who reckon, who are certain, that they shall meet their Lord, at the Resurrection, and that to Him 
they are returning, in the Hereafter, where He will reward them. O Children of Israel, remember My favour wherewith I favoured you, by giving thanks through 
obedience to Me, and that I have preferred you, your forefathers, above all the worlds, of their time; and fear, be scared of, the day when no sold for another shall give satisfaction, which is the Day 
of Resurrection, and no intercession shall be accepted (read either tuqbal or yuqbal) from it, that is, it is 
not the case that it has power to intercede, for it then to be accepted from it [or rejected, as God says], So 
now we have no intercessors [Q. 26:100]; nor any compensation, ransom, be taken, neither shall they be 
helped, to avoid God’s chastisement.","O Children of Israel[23], remember My favor that I bestowed upon you, and fulfill My covenant; I will fulfill your covenant[24], and fear none but Me. . And believe in what I have sent down[25] which confirms that [Scripture] which is with you, and do not be the first to disbelieve in it, nor trade my verses for a small price, and fear Me alone. . And do not mix the truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth knowingly[26]. . And establish prayer, give zakah, and bow [to Allah] with those who bow[27]. . Do you enjoin righteousness upon people while you forget yourselves, even though you recite the Scripture[28]? Do you not understand? . Seek help through patience and prayer. It is strenuous except for the humble, . those who are sure that they are going to meet their Lord, and that they will return to Him. . O Children of Israel, remember My blessing which I bestowed upon you and that I favored you over all other people[29]. . And fear a Day when no soul will avail another anything, nor intercession will be accepted, nor compensation taken, nor will they be helped.","[23] Israel is Prophet Jacob (عليه السلام). The use of the epithet ‘Children of Israel’ for the Israelites is to remind them to follow their ancestor from whom they are descended.
 [24] This mutual pledge is as follows: If the Children of Israel keep up the prayer, give zakah, believe in and support the prophets, and spend in the cause of Allah, Allah will, in return, expiate their sins and admit them to the Gardens under which rivers flow, i.e., Paradise. . [25] i.e., the prophethood of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), which is mentioned in the Torah. . [26] The prophethood of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). . [27] This command is to the Children of Israel to bow down in obedience to Allah with Muhammad, as the Muslims do, i.e., embrace Islam. . [28] i.e., the Torah. . [29] In their time, Allah favored them with certain privileges over other people such as sending them prophets and divine Books, and giving them kingship."
2,49,52,"And, remember, when We delivered you, your forefathers: the address here and henceforth di¬ 
rected to those living at the time of the our Prophet, is about how God blessed their forefathers, and is 
intended to remind them of God’s grace so that they might believe; from the folk of Pharaoh who were 
visiting you with, that is, making you taSte, evil chastisement, of the worSt kind (the sentence here is a 
circumstantial qualifier referring to the person of the pronoun [suffixed] in najjaynakum, ‘We delivered

were able to cross it and escape from your enemy; and We delivered you, from drowning, and drowned 
Pharaoh’s folk, his people with him, while you were beholding the sea crashing down on top of them. And when We appointed for ( waadna or wa’adna) Moses forty nights, at the end of which We 
shall give him the Torah for you to implement, then you took to yourselves the calf, the one which the 
Samaritan fashioned for you as a god, after him, that is, after he departed for Our appointment, and you 
were evildoers, for taking it [in worship], because you direded your worship to the wrong place. Then We pardoned you, erasing your sins, after that, ad of worship, so that you might be thank¬ 
ful, for Our favour upon you.","And [remember] when We saved you from Pharaoh’s people, who were inflicting dreadful torment upon you: slaughtering your sons and sparing your women. That was a great trial from your Lord. . And [remember] when We parted the sea for you and saved you, while We drowned the people of Pharaoh while you were looking on. . And [remember] when We appointed for Moses forty nights. Then you took the calf [for worship] in his absence, while you were wrongdoers. . Yet We pardoned you after that, so that you may be grateful.",
2,53,57,"And when We gave to Moses the Scripture, the Torah, and the Criterion ( wa’l-furqan is an expli¬ 
cative supplement [of Torah]), that is, the one that discriminates (faraqa) 3 between truth and falsehood 
and between what is licit and illicit, so that you might be guided, by it away from error. And when Moses said to his people, those who worshipped the calf, ‘My people, you have done 
wrong againSt yourselves by your taking the [golden] calf, for a god; now turn to your Creator, away 
from that worship [of the calf] and slay one another, that is, let the innocent of you slay the guilty; That, 
slaughter, will be better for you in your Creator’s sight’, who made it easier for you to accomplish this 
and sent down a dark cloud over you, so that none of you was able to see the other and show him mercy, 
such that aim oft seventy thousand of you were killed; and He will turn to you [relenting], before your 
[turning in] repentance; truly He is the Relenting, the Merciful. And when you said, having gone out with Moses to apologise before God for your worship of 
the calf, and having heard what he had said [to you]; ‘O Moses, we will not believe you till we see God 
openly’, with our own eyes; and the thunderbolt, the shout, took you, and you died, while you were be¬ 
holding, what was happening to you. Then We raised you up, brought you back to life, after you were dead, so that you might be thank¬ 
ful, for this favour of Ours. And We made the cloud overshadow you, that is. We sheltered you with fine clouds from the heat 
of the sun while you were in the wilderness; and We sent down, in them [the clouds], upon you manna 
and quails — which are [repetitively, a type of citrus known as] turunjabin and the quail — and We said: 
‘Eat of the good things We have provided for you’, and do not ftore any of it away, but they were not 
grateful for this favour and ftored the food, and so they were deprived of it; And they did not wrong Us, 
in this, but themselves they wronged, since the evil consequences [of this] befell them.","And [remember] when We gave Moses the Scripture and the criterion[30], so that you may be guided. . And [remember] when Moses said to his people, “O my people, you have wronged yourselves by taking the calf [for worship]. So repent to your Creator and kill yourselves [i.e., the guilty among you]; that is best for you with your Creator.” Then He accepted your repentance, for He is the Accepter of Repentance, the Most Merciful. . And [remember] when you said, “O Moses, we will never believe you until we see Allah openly,” so a thunderbolt struck you while you were looking on. . Then We raised you back to life after your death, so that you may be grateful. . And We shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails[31], [saying], “Eat of the good things We have provided for you.” They did not wrong Us, but they wronged themselves.","[30] Differentiating between truth and falsehood.

2,58,59,"And when We said, to them, after they came out of the wilderness, ‘Enter this city, either the 
Holy House [of Jerusalem] ( Bayt al-Maqdis ) or Jericho ( Ariha ), and eat freely therein wherever you 
will, plentifully and without any reftridtions, and enter it at the gate, its gate, prostrating, bowing, and 
say, ‘our requeft is for [an] exoneration’, that is, ‘That we be exonerated from our transgressions’, and 
We shall forgive ( naghfir: a variant reading has one of the two passive forms yughfar or tughfar, ‘[they] 
will be forgiven’) you your transgressions and We shall give more to those who are virtuous’ — through 
obedience — in terms of reward. Then the evildoers, among them, substituted a saying other than that which had been said to 
them, and said inftead, ‘A grain inside a hair’ and entered [the town] dragging themselves on their rears; 

3 Here and where the term appears throughout the remainder of the commentary, the term furqan — rendered as ‘the Criterion — 
is always glossed by an explanation in the Arabic that uses the same root f-r-q, ‘to discriminate [between]’; this is how the exegetes 
are able to deduce the meaning of the expression. The furqan then is that by which one is able to ‘discriminate between ( faraqa ) 
truth and falsehood. Such lexical correlations between the Qur’anic term and the explicative gloss is typical of the hermeneutical 
approach to seemingly unfamiliar scriptural expressions.

so We sent down upon the evildoers (the replacement of the second person [of the previous verse] with 
the overt identification in the third person alladhina zalamu, ‘the evildoers’, is intended to emphasise 
the depravity of their adion) wrath, a punishment of plague, from the heaven for their wickedness, for 
deviating from obedience, and within a very short period of time just under seventy thousand of them 
were dead.","And [remember] when We said, “Enter this town [of Jerusalem] and eat freely from wherever you wish, and enter the gate bowing down humbly and say, ‘Absolve us[32].’ We will forgive you your sins and increase [the reward of] those who do good.” . But the wrongdoers changed the words to other than what they were told[33]; so We sent down upon the wrongdoers a torment from the heaven for their rebelliousness.","[32] In gratitude to Allah and admission of sin. .

We said, ‘Strike with your ftaffthe rock, (the one that ran off with his robe, a light cube-like [rock] about 
the size of a mans head, made of marble) and he struck it, and there exploded, there burst: and gushed 
forth, from it twelve fountains, equal to the number of tribes, each people, [each] tribe among them,

them, ‘Eat and drink of that which God has provided, and do not be degenerate in the earth, seeking 
corruption’ (mufsidin is a circumstantial qualifier emphasising its operator, the subjed of the verb [la 
ta’thaw, ‘do not be degenerate’] derived from ‘athiya, meaning afsada, ‘to corrupt’). And when you said, ‘Moses, we will not endure one sort of food, that is to say, manna and quails;

earth produces —green herbs, cucumbers, garlic, lentils, onions’, he, Moses, said, to them, ‘Would you 
exchange what is better, more noble, that is, do you substitute this, with what is lowlier?’ (the hamza of 
a-taflabdiluna is for rebuke); they thus refused to change their mind and he [Moses] supplicated to God,

the signs of God and slay prophets, such as Zachariah and John, without right, that is, unjustly; that was 
because they disobeyed, and they were transgressors, overstepping the bounds in disobedience (here 
the repetition [dhalik bi-ma ‘asaw wa-kanu ya’tadun] is for emphasis). Surely those who believe, [who believed] before, in the prophets, and those of Jewry, the Jews, 
and the Christians, and the Sabaeans, a Christian or Jewish sed, whoever, from among them, believes 
in God and the LaSt Day, in the time of our Prophet, and performs righteous deeds, according to the 
Law given to him — their wage, that is, the reward for their deeds, is with their Lord, and no fear shall 
befall them, neither shall they grieve (the [singular] person of the verbs amana, ‘believes’, and ‘amila, 
‘performs’, takes account of the [singular] form of man, ‘whoever’, but in what comes afterwards [of the 
plural pronouns] its [plural] meaning [is taken into account]).","And [remember] when Moses asked for water for his people, and We said, “Strike the rock with your staff,” Then twelve springs gushed forth from it; each tribe knew its drinking place[34]. “Eat and drink from Allah’s provision, and do not spread corruption in the land.” . And [remember] when you said, “O Moses, we cannot bear the same meal. So call upon your Lord to bring forth for us from what the earth produces – its herbs, cucumbers, garlic, lentils, and onions.” Moses said, “Would you exchange what is better for what is inferior? Go down to any town and you will have what you have asked for.” They were struck with humiliation and destitution, and incurred the wrath of Allah. That was because they used to reject the signs of Allah and kill the prophets unjustly. That was because they disobeyed and were transgressors. .

what We have given you, and remember what is in it, ading in accordance with it, so that you might 
preserve yourselves’, from the Fire or ads of disobedience. Then you turned away thereafter, and but for God’s bounty and His mercy towards you, you 
would have been among the losers [there is no commentary on this verse]. And verily ( wa-la-qad: the lam is for oaths) you know that there were those among you who 
transgressed, violated, the Sabbath, by fishing, when We had forbidden you to do so — these were the 
inhabitants of Eilat — and We said to them, ‘Be apes, despised!’, rejeded, and they became so: they died 
three days later. And We made it, this punishment, an exemplary punishment, a lesson to dissuade others from 
doing what they did; for all the former times and for the latter, that is, for the people of that time or 
those that came later; and an admonition to such as who fear, God: these are singled out for mention 
here because they, in contract to others, are the ones who benefit thereby.

2,67,73,"And, mention, when Moses said to his people, when one among them was killed and the killer 
was not known, and so they asked Moses to pray to God to reveal the killer, which he did; ‘God com¬ 
mands you to sacrifice a cow’. They said, ‘Do you take us in mockery?’, that is, making fun of us when 
you answer us like this? He said, ‘I take refuge with, I seek defence with, God left I should be one of the 
ignorant’, one of those who indulge in mockery. But when they realised that he was being serious, They said, ‘Pray to your Lord for us, that He 
may make clear to us what she may be’, its true nature, He, Moses, said, ‘He, God, says she is a cow 
neither old, nor virgin, that is, young, middling between the two, in terms of age; so do what you have 
been commanded’, byway of sacrificing it. They said, ‘Pray to your Lord for us, that He make clear to us what her colour may be’ He said, 
‘He says she shall be a golden cow, bright in colour, that is, of a very intense yellow, gladdening to be¬ 
holders: its beauty will please those that look at it. They said, ‘Pray to your Lord for us, that He make clear to us what she may be: does it graze 
freely or is it used in labour?; the cows (that is, the Species described in the way mentioned), are all alike 
to us, because there are many of them and we have not been able to find the one sought after; and if 
God wills, we shall then be guided’ to it. In one hadith [it is reported]: ‘Had they not uttered the proviso 
[inshaa Llah], it would never have been made clear to them’. He said, ‘He says she shall be a cow not broken, not subdued for labour, that is, to plough the 
earth, churning its soil for sowing ( tuthir al-ard: the clause describes the word dhalul, and constitutes 
part of the negation); or to water the tillage, that is, the land prepared for sowing; one safe, from faults 
and the effedts of toil; with no blemish, of a colour other than her own, on her’. They said, ‘Now you have 
brought the truth’, that is, [now] you have explained it clearly; they thus sought it out and found it with 
a boy very dutiful towards his mother, and they eventually purchased it for the equivalent of its weight in 
gold; and so they sacrificed her, even though they very nearly did not, on account of its excessive coSt. 
In a hadith [it is Stated that], ‘Had they sacrificed any cow, it would have sufficed them, but they made it 
difficult for themselves and so God made it difficult for them’. And when you killed a living soul, and difputed thereon (iddara’tum: the ta [of the root-form 
itdara’tum] has been assimilated with the dal) — and God disclosed what you were hiding (this is a par¬ 
enthetical Statement; the Story begins here [with wa-idh qataltum nafsan, ‘and when you killed a soul’... 
and continues in the following]): so We said, ‘Smite him, the slain man, with part of it’, and so when he was Struck with its tongue 
or its tail, he came back to life and said, ‘So-and-so killed me’, and after pointing out two of his cousins, 
he died; the two [killers] were denied the inheritance and were later killed. God says: even so, is the re¬ 
vival, for, God brings to life the dead, and He shows you His signs, the proofs of His power, so that you 
might underftand, [that you might] reflecft and realise that the One capable of reviving a single soul is 
also capable of reviving a multitude of souls, and then believe.","And [remember] when Moses said to his people, “Allah commands you to slaughter a cow.” They said, “Are you mocking us?” Moses said, “I seek refuge in Allah from being among the ignorant!” . They said, “Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what [type of cow] it is.” He said, “Allah says, ‘It is a cow that is neither too old nor too young, but somewhere in between. So do as you are commanded!’” . They said, “Call upon your Lord to show us its color.” He said, “Allah says, ‘It is a yellow cow, bright in color – pleasing to the beholders.’” . They again said, “Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is. All cows look alike to us. If Allah wills, we will surely be guided.” . He said, “Allah says, ‘It is a cow neither trained to plow the earth nor water the field; sound, without blemish.’” They said, “Now you have come with the truth.” Then they slaughtered it, although they were almost not doing it. . And [remember] when you [Israelites] slew a man and disputed as to who the killer was, but Allah exposed what you were concealing. . We said, “Strike the slain with a piece of it.” This is how Allah brings the dead to life and shows you His signs, so that you may understand.",

person address). Are you then so eager, O believers, that they, the Jews, should believe you, seeing there is a party 
of them, a group of their rabbis, that heard God’s word, in the Torah, and then tampered with it, chang¬ 
ing it, and that, after they had comprehended it, [after] they had understood it, knowingly?, [knowing

full well] that they were indulging in mendacity (the hamza [at the beginning of the verb a-fa-tatmaun] 
is [an interrogative] for rejection, in other words, ‘Do not be so eager, for they have disbelieved before’).","Then your hearts became hardened after that, like rocks or even harder. There are rocks from which rivers gush forth, and there are others that split open from which water comes out, while others fall down out of humility to Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you do. . Do you [O believers] hope that they would respond to your call to believe, while a party of them used to hear the word of Allah[35] then distort it knowingly after understanding it?","[35] i.e., the Torah."
2,76,77,"And when they, the hypocrites from among the Jews, meet those who believe, they say, ‘We be¬ 
lieve’, that Muhammad (s) is a prophet and that he is the one of whom we have been given good tidings 
in our Book; but when they go in private one to another, they, their leaders the ones not involved in the 
hypocrisy, say, to those hypocrites: ‘Do you Cpeak to them, the believers, of what God has disclosed to 
you, that is, what He has made known to you of Muhammad’s (s) description in the Torah, so that they 
may thereby dispute (the lam of li-yuhajjukum, ‘that they may dilute with you’, is the lam of ‘becom¬ 
ing’) with you before your Lord?, in the Hereafter and hold the proof against you for not following him 
[Muhammad (s)], despite your knowledge of his sincerity? Have you no understanding?’ of the faCt that 
they will contend with you if you ^eak to them in this way? So beware. God says: Know they not (the interrogative is affirmative, the inserted wdw [of a-wa-ld] is to 
indicate the supplement) that God knows what they keep secret and what they proclaim?, that is, what 
they hide and what they reveal in this matter and all other matters, so that they may desist from these 
things.","And when they meet the believers they say, “We believe.” But when they[36] meet one another in private they say, “Are you telling them what Allah has revealed to you [about Mohammad], so that they may argue against you before your Lord? Have you no sense?” . Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal?","[36] i.e., the Jews."
2,78,79,"And there are some of them, the Jews, that are illiterate, unlettered, not knowing the Scripture, 
the Torah, but only desires, lies which were handed down to them by their leaders and which they relied 
upon; and, in their rejection of the prophethood of the Prophet and fabrications of other matters, they 
have, mere conjectures, and no firm knowledge. So woe, a severe chastisement, to those who write the Scripture with their hands, that is, fabricat¬ 
ing it themselves, then say, ‘This is from God’ that they may sell it for a small price, of this world: these 
are the Jews, the ones that altered the description of the Prophet in the Torah, as well as the ‘Stoning’ 
verse, and other details, and rewrote them in a way different from that in which they were revealed. So 
woe to them for what their hands have written, of fabrications, and woe to them for their earnings, by 
way of bribery ( rishan, plural of rishwa ).","And among them, there are illiterate people, who know nothing of the Scripture except wishful thinking, and they do nothing but guesswork. . So woe to those who write the Scripture with their own hands, and then say, “This is from Allah,” in order to trade it for a small price. Woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they earn.",
2,80,82,"And they say, when the Prophet promised them the Fire, ‘the Fire shall not touch us, that is, af- 
flicft us, save a number of days’, only a short time of forty days: the same length of time their forefathers 
worshipped the calf, after which time it [the Fire] will cease. Say, to them Muhammad (s): ‘Have you 
taken with God a covenant?, a pledge from Him to this? God will not fail in His covenant, in this matter, 
or — nay — say you against God what you do not know? ( a’ttakhadhtum : the conjunctive hamza has 
been omitted on account of the interrogative hamza sufficing). Not so, it will touch you and you will abide therein; whoever earns evil, through associating 
another with God, and is encompassed by his transgression, in the singular and the plural, that is to 
say, it overcomes him and encircles him totally, for, he has died an idolater — those are the inhabit¬ 
ants of the Fire, therein abiding (khalidun: this [plural noun] takes account of the [plural] import of 
man, ‘whoever’). And those who believe and perform righteous deeds — those are the inhabitants of Paradise, 
therein abiding.","And they say, “The Fire will never touch us except for a few days.” Say, “Have you taken a covenant from Allah; for Allah will never break His covenant, or are you saying about Allah what you do not know?” . No indeed! Those who do evil and are surrounded by their sins – they are the people of the Fire; they will abide therein forever. . But those who believe and do righteous deeds – they are the people of Paradise; they will abide therein forever.",
2,83,86,"And, mention, when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel, in the Torah, where We 
said: ‘You shall not worship (a variant reading [for la ta’buduna] has [third person plural] la ya’budun 
[‘they shall not worship’]) any other than God (la tabuduna ilia Lldha is a predicate denoting a prohibi¬ 
tion; one may also read id tabudu [Worship you not]); and to be good, and righteous, to parents, and 
the near of kin: here kinship is adjoined to parents; and to orphans, and to the needy; and Cpeak well, 
[good] words, to men, commanding good and forbidding evil, being truthful with regard to the status 
of Muhammad (s), and being kind to them [sc. orphans and the needy] (a variant reading [for hasanan ] 
has husnan, the verbal noun, used as a hyperbolic description); and observe prayer and pay the alms’, 
which you actually accepted, but, then you turned away, refusing to fulfil these [obligations] (here the 
second person address is used, but their forefathers are [£till] meant); all but a few of you, rejecting it.

like your forefathers. And when We made a covenant with you, and We said: ‘ You shall not shed your own blood, fill¬ 
ing it by slaying one another; neither expel your own from your habitations’: let no one of you expel the 
other from his house; then you confirmed it, that is, you accepted this covenant, and you bore witness, 
upon your own souls. Then there you are killing one another, and expelling a party of you from their habitations, 
conspiring ( tazzdharuna: the original ta has been assimilated with the za; a variant reading has it with¬ 
out [the assimilation, that is, tazaharuna]), assisting one another, again St them in sin, in disobedience, 
and enmity, injustice, and if they come to you as captives (a variant reading [for usdra] has asrd), you 
ransom them (a variant reading [for tafduhum ] has tufaduhum), that is to say, you deliver them from 
captivity with money etc., and this [ransoming] was one of the things to which they were pledged; yet 
their expulsion was forbidden you ( muharramun ‘alaykum ikhrdjuhum is semantically connected to 
wa-tukhrijuna, ‘and expelling’, and the statement that comes in between is parenthetical, that is, [expul¬ 
sion was forbidden you] in the same way that non-ransoming was forbidden you). Qurayza had allied 
themselves with the Aws, and the Nadir with the Khazraj, but every member of an alliance would fight 
against a fellow ally, thus destroying each other’s homes and expelling one another, taking prisoners and 
then ransoming them. When they were asked: ‘Why do you fight them and then pay their ransom?’, they 
would reply, ‘Because we have been commanded to ransom’; and they would be asked, ‘So, why do you 
fight them then?’, to which they would say, ‘For fear that our allies be humiliated’; God, exalted, says: 
What, do you believe in part of the Book, that is, the part about ransom, and disbelieve in part?, namely, 
the part about renouncing fighting, expulsion and assistance [againSt one another]; What shall be the 
requital of those of you who do that, but degradation, disgrace and ignominy, in the life of this world: 
they were disgraced when Qurayza were slewn and the Nadir were expelled to Syria, 4 and ordered to pay 
the jizya; and on the Day of Resurrection to be returned to the mo ft terrible of chastisement? And God 
is not heedless of what you do (ta’maluna, or read ya maliina, ‘they do’). Those are the ones who have purchased the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter, by pre¬ 
ferring the former to the latter — for them the punishment shall not be lightened, neither shall they be 
helped, [neither shall they be] protected againSt it.","And [remember] when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, “Do not worship except Allah; be kind to parents and kindred, and to orphans and those in need; speak good words to people; establish prayer; and give Zakah.” But then you turned away paying no heed, except a few of you. . And [remember] when We took a covenant from you that you should neither shed blood of one another, nor expel one another from your homes. Then you acknowledged it, while bearing and you bear witness to it. . Then here you are, killing one another and expelling a group of your people from their homes, aiding one another against them in sin and aggression. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although their expulsion was forbidden to you[37]. Do you then believe in part of the Scripture and deny another part? Then what is the recompense for those who do so among you except disgrace in this life, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be subjected to the severest torment? For Allah is not unaware of what you do. . These are the people who have purchased the life of this world for the Hereafter; their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be helped.","[37] There were three Jewish tribes who allied themselves with the two Arab tribes of Madinah before Islam: Banū Qaynuqā‘, Banū an-Nadīr and Banū Qurayzah. In their prolonged feuds, the Jewish clans fought alongside their allies against their brethren."
2,87,88,"And We gave Moses the Scripture, the Torah, and after him We sent successive messengers, that is, 
We sent them one after another, and We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs, that is, the miracles of 
bringing the dead back to life and healing the blind and the leper, and We confirmed him. We Strength¬ 
ened him, with the Holy Spirit (the expression ruh al-qudus is an example of annexing [in a genitive con¬ 
struction] the noun described to the adjedtive [qualifying it], in other words, al-ruh al-muqaddasa), that 
is, Gabriel, [so described] on account of his [Jesus’s] sandtity; he would accompany him [Jesus] wherever 
he went; Still you refuse to be upright, and whenever there came to you a messenger, with what your 
soids did not desire, [did not] like, in the way of truth, you became arrogant, you disdained to follow 
him ( iStakbartum, ‘you became arrogant’, is the response to the particle kullama, ‘whenever’, and consti¬ 
tutes the interrogative, and is meant as a rebuke); and some, of them, you called liars, such as Jesus, and 
some you slay?, such as Zachariah and John (the present tenses [of these verbs] are used to narrate the 
paSt events [as though they were events in the present], in other words, ‘[and some] you slew’). And they say, to the Prophet mockingly: ‘Our hearts are encased’ (ghulf is the plural of aghlaf), 
that is to say, wrapped up in covers and cannot comprehend what you say; God, exalted be He, says: Nay 
(bal introduces the rebuttal), but God has cursed them, removed them far from His mercy and degraded 
them when they rejedted [the messengers], for their unbelief, which is not the result of anything defec¬ 
tive in their hearts; and little will they believe (fa-qalilan ma yuminun: the md here is extra, emphasis¬ 
ing the ‘littleness’ involved): that is, their belief is minimal.","We gave Moses the Scripture and sent a succession of messengers after him. We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear signs and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit[38]. Is it that every time a messenger comes to you [O Israelites] with something against your desires, you become arrogant; some of them you rejected, and others you killed? . They say, “Our hearts are wrapped.” Nay, Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, little is it that they believe.","[38] i.e., the Angel Gabriel (عليه السلام)."

saying: ‘God, give us assistance against them through the Prophet that shall be sent at the end of time’; 
but when there came to them what they recognised, as the truth, that is, the mission of the Prophet, they 
disbelieved in it, out of envy and for fear of losing leadership (the response to the firSt lamma particle is 
indicated by the response to the second one); and the curse of God is on the disbelievers. Evil is that for which they sell their soids, that is, their share of the reward [in the Hereafter] 

( bi’sama, ‘evil is that [for] which’: ma here is an indefinite particle, representing ‘a thing’, and constitutes 
a Specification qualifying the subject of [the verb] bi’s, ‘evil is’, the very thing being singled out for criti¬ 
cism); that they disbelieve in that, Qur’an, which God has revealed, grudging (baghyan here is an objeCt 
denoting reason for yakfuru, ‘they disbelieve’), that is, out of envy, that God should reveal (read either 
yunzil or yunazzil ) of His bounty, the Inspiration, to whomever He will of His servants, to deliver the 
Message; and they were laden, they returned, with anger, from God for their disbelief in what He has 
revealed (the indefinite form, bi-ghadabin, ‘with anger’, is used to emphasise the awesomeness [of the 
‘anger’]), upon anger, which they deserved formerly, when they negleded the Torah and disbelieved in 
Jesus; and for the disbelievers there shall be a humiliating chastisement.","Now that there has come to them a Book from Allah[39], confirming that which is with them[40] – although they used to pray for victory over the disbelievers in the past. But when there came to them what they recognize [to be true], they rejected it. May the curse of Allah be upon the disbelievers! . How miserable is the price for which they sold their souls – disbelieving in Allah’s revelation out of jealous hatred that Allah would send down His grace to whom He wills of His slaves! Thus they have incurred wrath upon wrath[41], and for the disbelievers, there will be a disgracing punishment.","[39] i.e., the Qur’an.
 [40] i.e., the Jews. . [41] They deserved double wrath: firstly for their earlier rebelliousness and then for denying Muhammad (ﷺ)."
2,91,93,"And when it was said to them, ‘Believe in what God has revealed, that is, the Qur’an and other 
[Books], they said, ‘We believe in what was revealed to us’, that is, the Torah; and (wd, here indicates 
a circumstantial qualifier) they disbelieve in what is beyond that, what is other than that or what came 
afterwards, such as the Qur’an; yet it is the truth (wa-huwa’l-haqqu is a circumstantial qualifier) con¬ 
firming ( musaddiqan, a second circumstantial qualifier for emphasis) what is with them. Say, to them: 
‘Why then were you slaying the prophets of God formerly, if you were believers?’ in the Torah and in it 
you were forbidden to kill them: this address, concerning what their forefathers did, is directed towards 
those present at the time of our Prophet, on account of their approval of it [that is, of what the forefathers 
had done]. And Moses came to you with clear proofs, miracles, such as the Staff, his hand, and the parting of 
the sea; then you took to yourselves the calf, as a god, after him, after he had gone to the appointment, 
and you were evildoers, for taking it [in worship]. And when We made a covenant with you, to aCt according to what is in the Torah, and raised over 
you the Mount, to drop it on you, when you had refused to accept it; We said, ‘Take forcefully, seriously 
and with effort, what We have given you, and listen’, to what you have been commanded, and be pre¬ 
pared to accept it, They said, ‘We hear, your words, and disobey’, your command; and they were made 
to drink the calf in their hearts, that is to say, the love of it [the golden calf] intoxicated their hearts in 
the way that wine does, on account of their unbelief. Say, to them: ‘Evil is that, thing, which your belief, 
in the Torah, enjoins on you, [in the way of] the worship of the [golden] calf, if you are believers’, in it, 
as you claim; meaning, you are not believers, for faith does not command that you worship the calf — 
their forefathers are meant here. Likewise, you do not believe in the Torah, because you have denied [the 
prophethood of] Muhammad (s), whereas faith in it does not command you to rejecft him.","When it is said to them, “Believe in what Allah has sent down[42],” they say, “We only believe in what was sent down to us[43],” and they deny what came afterwards, although it is the truth confirming that which is with them. Say, “Then why did you kill the prophets of Allah before, if you were truly believers?” . Moses came to you with clear signs, yet you took the calf [for worship] in his absence, while you were wrongdoers. . And [remember] when We took a covenant from you and We raised above you the mountain [saying], “Hold firmly to what We have given you and obey,” they said, “We hear and disobey.” The love of [worshiping] the calf was engraved in their hearts because of their disbelief. Say, “How wretched is what your faith enjoins you, if you are believers!”","[42] i.e., the Qur’an. [43] i.e., the Torah."
2,94,96,"Say, to them: ‘If the Abode of the Hereafter, that is, Paradise, with God is purely yours, that is, 
exclusively, and not for other people, as you allege, then long for death — if you Speak truly’ (here both 
conditionals are connected to the verb tamannu, ‘long for’, so that the firdt is dependent upon the second, 
in other words, ‘If you ipeak truly when you claim that it is yours, then you will naturally incline to what 
is yours, and since the path to it is death, long for it [death]’). But they will never long for it, because of that which their own hands have sent before them, as a 
result of their rejection of the Prophet (s), the consequence of their mendacity. God knows the evildoers, 
the disbelievers and He will requite them. And you shall find them (the lam of la-tajidannahum is for oaths) the people moSt covetous of 
life, and, more covetous of it than, the idolaters, who rejecft the [idea of the] Resurrection, for the former 
know that their journey’s end will be the Fire, while the idolaters do not believe even in this; any one of 
them woidd love, wishes, that he might be given life for a thousand years (law yuammar, ‘[if only] he 
might be given life’: the particle law, ‘if only’, relates to the verbal noun and functions with the sense of

an, ‘that’ and together with its relative clause explains the [implicit] verbal noun in the objeCt of the verb 
yawaddu, ‘he would love’); yet, any one of them, his being given life (an yu ammara, ‘that he should be 
given life’, constitutes the subject of the verb muzahzihihi, ‘that it should budge him’ [this verb comes 
later], as though it were tamiruhu, ‘the giving of life to him’) shall not budge, remove, hint from the chas¬ 
tisement, of the Fire. God sees what they do (ya’maluna may be alternatively read ta’maluna, ‘you do’), 
and will requite them. [‘Abd Allah] Ibn Surya 5 asked the Prophet (s), or ‘Umar [b. al-Khattab], about 
which angel brings down the revelation, and he replied that it was Gabriel; he [Ibn Surya] then said, ‘He 
is our enemy, because he brings chastisement with him; had it been Michael, we would have believed in 
him, because he brings fertility and security.’ Then, the following was revealed:","Say, “If the Home of the Hereafter with Allah is only for you [O Israelites] among all humans, then wish for death, if you are truthful.” . But they will never wish for that because of what their hands have sent forth. And Allah is All-Knowing of the wrongdoers. . And you will surely find them the most greedy people for life, even more than the polytheists. Each one of them wishes to have a life of a thousand years. Even if they were granted such a long life, it would not save them from the punishment; for Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.",
2,97,98,"Say, to them: ‘Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel, let him die in exasperation — he it was that 
brought it, the Qur’an, down upon your heart by the leave, by the command, of God, confirming what 
was before it, of scriptures, a guidance, from error, and good tidings, of Paradise, for the believers. Whoever is an enemy to God and His angels and His messengers, and Gabriel (read Jibril or 
Jabril, Jibra’il or Jabra’il, Jibra’il or Jabra’il), and Michael (Mikal, also read Mikail, or Mikail; a supple¬ 
ment to mala’ikatihi, ‘His angels’, an example of the Specific being supplemented to the collective) — then 
surely God is an enemy to the disbelievers’ (He says ‘to the disbelievers’ instead of ‘to them’ in order to 
point out their Status).","Say [O Prophet], “Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel – it is he who brings down this [Qur’an] to your heart by Allah’s permission, confirming what came before it, and a guidance and glad tidings for the believers.” . Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and messengers, and to Gabriel and Michael – then Allah is indeed an enemy to the disbelievers.",
2,99,101,"And We have revealed to you, O Muhammad (s), clear proofs, lucid [ones] ( bayyinatin, clear 
proofs’, is a circumstantial qualifier; this was in response to Ibn Surya saying to the Prophet (s), ‘You 
have not brought us anything’); and none disbelieves in them except the wicked, these have disbelieved 
in them. Why, whenever they make a covenant, with God that they will believe in the Prophet (s') when 
he appears, or that they will not give assistance to the idolaters againSt the Prophet (s), does a party of 
them rejed it?, caSt it away repudiating it (this is the response to the clause beginning with kullama, the 
interrogative of rebuke). Nay (bal indicates a transition), but mod of them are disbelievers. When there came to them a messenger from God, namely, Muhammad (s), confirming what was 
with them, a party of them who were given the Scripture have cad away the Scripture of God, that is, 
the Torah, behind their backs, that is to say, they have not aCted according to what it said about belief in 
the Messenger and otherwise; as though they did not know, what is contained in it, to the effeCt that he 
is a true Prophet, or that it is the Book of God.","We have sent down to you clear proofs, and none will reject them except the evildoers. . Is it that every time they ratify a covenant, a party of them cast it aside? In fact, most of them do not believe. . And when a messenger[44] from Allah came to them – confirming what was with them, a party of the People of the Book cast Allah’s Scripture behind their backs as if they did not know.","[44] i.e., Muhammad (ﷺ)."
2,102,103,"And they follow (wa’ttabau is a supplement to nabadha, ‘[it] caSt away’) what the devils used 
to relate, during the time of, Solomon’s kingdom, in the way of sorcery: it is said that they [the devils] 
buried these [books of sorcery] underneath his throne when his kingdom was taken from him; it is also 
said that they used to listen stealthily and add fabrications to what they heard, and then pass it on to the 
prieSts, who would compile it in books; this would be disseminated and rumours Spread that the jinn 
had knowledge of the Unseen. Solomon gathered these books and buried them. When he died, the devils 
showed people where these books were, and the latter brought them out and found that they contained

rejected the Scriptures of their prophets. In order to demonstrate Solomon’s innocence and in repudia¬

the party of Jewish leaders that came to interview the Prophet about his religion and to teS his knowledge of previous Scriptures; it 
is not clear at what point he became a Muslim (hence ‘Abd Allah), for Ibn Kathir also Sates that he apoSatised at a later Sage; see

Sura al-Baqara 

Iraq — Harut and Marut (here the names are standing in for ‘the two angels’, or an explication of the lat¬ 
ter). Ibn ‘Abbas said 6 , ‘They were two sorcerers who used to teach [people] magic’; it is also said that they 
were two angels that had been sent to teach [sorcery] to people as a trial from God. They taught not any 
man, without them saying, by way of counsel, ‘We are hut a temptation, a trial from God for people, so 
that He may teft them when they are taught it: whoever learns it is a disbeliever, but whoever renounces 
it, he is a believer; do not disbelieve’, by learning it; if this person refused and insisted on learning it, 
they would teach him. From them they learned how they might cause division between a man and his 
wife, so that they would hate each other, yet they, the sorcerers, did not hurt any man thereby, that is, 
by this magic, save by the leave of God, by His will; and they learned what hurt them, in the Hereafter, 
and did not profit them, and this was sorcery. And surely (the lam [of la-qad, ‘surely’] is for oaths) they, 
the Jews, knew well that whoever ( la-man: the lam denotes [part of] the subject of the sentence and is 
semantically connected to what precedes it; the man introduces the relative clause) buys it, [whoever] 
chooses it and took it in place of God’s Book, he shall have no share in the Hereafter, that is, no portion 
of Paradise; evil then woidd have been, the thing, that they sold themselves for, those sellers, that is to 
say, the portion due for this [acft] in the Hereafter, if they were to learn it; for it would have made the Fire 
obligatory in their case; if they had but known, the reality of the chastisement they would be destined 
for, they would not have learnt it. Yet if only they, the Jews, had believed, in the Prophet and the Qur’an, and been fearful, of 
God’s chastisement, by abandoning acfts of disobedience towards Him, such as sorcery (the response to 
the [conditional clause beginning with] law, ‘if’, has been omitted, [but it is intimated to be] ‘they would 
have been rewarded’, and this is indicated by [His following words]) verily, a reward from God would 
have been better, than that for which they sold themselves, if they had but known, that this is better they 
would not have preferred that over this ( la-mathubatun, ‘verily the reward’, is the subject; the lam is that 
of oaths; and min ‘indi’Llahi khayrun, ‘from God, would have been better’, is the predicate).","They followed what was recited by the devils during the kingdom of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels Hārūt and Mārūt in Babylon. But these two angels did not teach anyone without telling them, “We are only a test, so do not disbelieve.” Yet they would learn from them what would cause separation between a man and his wife. But they could not harm anyone except by Allah’s permission. They would learn what harmed them and did not benefit them, although they already knew that whoever gets into it would not have any share in the Hereafter. How terrible was the price for which they sold themselves, if only they knew! . If only they had believed and feared Allah, they would have had a better reward from Allah, if only they knew!",
2,104,105,"O you who believe, do not say, to the Prophet (s), ‘Observe us’, ( raina is an imperative form 
from muraat) which they used to say to him, and this was a derogatory term in Hebrew, derived 
from the noun al-ru‘una [‘thoughtlessness’]. They found this very amusing and used to address the 
Prophet (s) in this way, and so the believers were forbidden to use it; but say, instead, ‘Regard us’, 
that is, look at us, and give ear, to what you are commanded and be prepared to accept it; and for 
disbelievers awaits a painful chastisement, that is, the Fire. Those disbelievers of the People of the Scripture and the idolaters, from among the Arabs (al- 
mushrikina, ‘idolaters’, is a supplement to ahl al-kitabi, ‘People of the Scripture’, and the min, ‘of’, is ex¬ 
plicative), do not wish that any good, any Inspiration, should be revealed to you from your Lord, out of 
envy of you, but God singles out for His mercy, [for] the office of His Prophet, whom He will; God is of 
bounty abounding.","O you who believe, do not say, “Rā‘inā,” [i.e., consider our situation!] But say, “Unzhurnā,” [i.e., wait for us!] and listen. And for the disbelievers there will be a painful torment. . Neither those who disbelieved from the People of the Book nor the polytheists wish that your Lord sends down any good to you [O Muslims]. But Allah chooses for His mercy whom He wills, for Allah is the possessor of great bounty.",

enjoins his Companions to one thing and then the next day he forbids it, God revealed: And whatever

either together with its recital or not [that is only its judgement, but its recital continues]; there is a vari¬

sentence [begun with ma] is: We bring [in place] a better, one that is more beneficial for [Our] servants, 
either because it is easier [to implement] or contains much reward; or the like of it, in terms of religious 
obligation 7 and reward; do you not know that God has power over all things?, including abrogating and 
substituting [verses]? (the interrogative here is meant as an affirmative). D° you n °t know that to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, doing what He 
pleases, and that you have none, besides God, other than God, neither protestor, to safeguard you, nor 
helper?, to keep away His chastisement when it comes. When the Meccans asked [the Prophet] to enlarge the size of Mecca and make Safa full of gold, 
the following was revealed: Or do you desire to question your Messenger as Moses was questioned, by 
his people, aforetime?, when they asked him to show them God openly among other things; whoever 
exchanges belief for unbelief, taking the latter in place of the former by refraining from contemplating 
the clear proofs and by requesting others instead, has surely Strayed from the even way, meaning, he has 
mistaken the proper path ( al-sawa essentially means al-wasat, ‘middle way’).","We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring a better one or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah is Most Capable of all things? . Do you not know that to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth, and that you have no protector or supporter besides Allah? . Or would you like to question your Messenger as Moses was questioned before? Whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has indeed strayed from the sound path.",
2,109,110,"Many of the People of the Scripture long that (law, ‘ [if only] that’, represents [the import of] the 
verbal noun) they might make you disbelievers, after you have believed, from the envy (hasadan is the 
objed denoting reason), being, of their own souls, that is to say, their wicked souls have prompted them 
to this [attitude]; after the truth, with regard to the Prophet (s), has become clear to them, in the Torah; 
yet pardon, leave them be, and be forgiving. Stay away, and make no encroachments againSt them, till 
God brings His command, concerning fighting them; truly God has power over all things. And perform the prayer, and pay the alms; whatever good, in the way of obedience, such as 
[observing] kinship and charity, you shall offer for your own souls, you shall find it, that is, its reward, 
with God; assuredly God sees what you do, and will requite you for it.","Many of the people of the Book wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed, out of the envy in their hearts, after the truth has become evident to them. But pardon and overlook until Allah passes His decree[45], for Allah is Most Capable of all things. . And establish prayer and give zakah. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will find it with Allah, for Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.","[45] The provision of this verse has been abrogated, as Allah passed His decree."
2,111,112,"And they say, ‘None shall enter Paradise except those who are Jews (hud is the plural oihaid) or 
Christians’: this is what the Jews of Medina and the Christians of Najran said when they disputed with 
the Prophet (s), each party separately claiming Paradise for its members exclusively. Such, sayings, are 
their desires, their false passions. Say, to them: ‘Produce your proof, your evidence for this, if you Speak 
truly’, in this matter. Nay, but, others will also enter Paradise, namely, whoever submits his purpose to God, that is, 
adheres to His commands ( wajh, ‘face’ [sc. ‘purpose’], is here mentioned because it is the mod noble part 
of the body, so that [when it has submitted] there is all the more reason for the other parts [to follow]), 
being virtuous, affirming God’s Oneness, his reward is with his Lord, the reward of his deeds being 
Paradise, and no fear shall befall them, neither shall they grieve, in the Hereafter.","And they say, “None will enter Paradise except a Jew or a Christian.” That is their wishful thinking. Say, “Produce your proof, if you are truthful.” . On the contrary, whoever submits himself to Allah and is a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. They will have no fear, nor will they grieve.",
2,113,113,"The Jews say, ‘The Christians Stand on nothing’, that can be used as support [for their claims], 
and they rejected Jesus; and the Christians say, ‘The Jews Stand on nothing’, that can be used as sup¬ 
port [for their claims], and they rejecfted Moses; yet they, both groups, recite the Scripture, revealed to 
them: in the Scripture of the Jews there is the confirmation of Jesus, and in that of the Christians there 
is the confirmation of Moses (yatluna’l-kitaba, ‘they recite the Scripture’: the sentence is a circumstantial 
qualifier). Thus, in the way that these have said, the ignorant, from among the Arabs and others, say the 
like of what these say (this lad phrase [mithla qawlihim, ‘the like of what they say’] is the explication of 
dhalika, ‘that [way]’): that is to say, to every person of religion they would say, ‘You have no basis’; God 
shall decide between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding their differences, in religion and will 
admit the confirmer into Paradise and the falsifier into the Fire. 

7 God’s imposition of religious obligations on mankind and His subjecting them to the Law ( sharia ) is expressed by the legal term 
takltf; a human being thus obligated is called mukallaf. The principle of taklif raised several issues from the point of view of the 
theologians, the moil important of which was the question of how human beings are able to know the obligations imposed upon 
them by God. Mu'tazilis responded by saying that obligations could be known in two ways, by reason (bi’l-'aql) and through rev¬ 
elation ( bi’l-sam ', or bi’l-shar’). Ash'aris, on the other hand, maintained that no obligation can be known except by revelation, and 
this was consonant with their belief that actions could not be good’ or ‘evil’ by their very nature: they were either one or the other 
because God has determined them so. See D. Gimaret, ‘taklif’, E12, x, 138k

Sura al-Baqara","The Jews say, “The Christians have nothing to stand on” and the Christians say, “The Jews have nothing to stand on[46],” although they both recite the Scripture. And those [pagans] who have no knowledge say something similar. Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.","[46] This incident is documented when the Christians of Najrān came to the Messenger of Allah, the rabbis met them and both parties disputed."
2,114,115,"And who does greater evil — that is, none does more evil — than he who bars God’s places 
of worship, so that His Name be not invoked in them, in prayer and praise, and strives to ruin them?, 
through destruction and impeding people from them: this was revealed to inform of the Byzantines’ de¬ 
struction of the Holy House [sc. Jerusalem], or [it was revealed] when the idolaters barred the Prophet (s) 
from entering Mecca in the year of the battle of Hudaybiyya; such men might never enter them, save in 
fear (ilia khaifina is a predicate, also functioning as a command, that is to say, ‘Frighten them by threats 
of waging war against them, so that not one of them shall enter it feeling secure); for them in this world 
is degradation, debasement through being killed, taken captive and forced to pay the jizya; and in the 
Hereafter a mighty chastisement, namely, the Fire. The following was revealed either when the Jews criticised the change of the direction of prayer 
[qibla], or concerning the supererogatory prayers on animal-back during journeys, which one may pray 
in any direction: To God belong the EaSt and the WeSt, that is, the entire earth, because these two [direc¬ 
tions] represent both sides of it [the earth]; whithersoever you turn, your faces in prayer by His com¬ 
mand, there is the Face of God, the direction of prayer with which He is pleased. Lo! God is Embracing, 
His bounty embracing all things. Knowing, how to manage His creation.","Who does greater wrong than the one who prevents Allah’s name to be mentioned in His mosques and strives for their destruction? Such people do not deserve to enter them except in fear[47]. There is a disgrace for them in this world and a great punishment in the Hereafter. . To Allah belong the east and the west; wherever you turn, there is the Face of Allah[48]. For Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing.","[47] Fear of divine justice or the believers will seize them. .

This is by way of consolation to the believers that one can find Allah wherever one turns in case of mistake, or prayer of those who prayed to the direction of Jerusalem, etc."
2,116,119,"And they, the Jews and the Christians, and those that claim that the angels are God’s daughters, 
say (read wa-qalu or [simply] qdlu) ‘God has taken to Himself a son’; God says: Glory be to Him!, as a 
way of exalting Himself above this; Nay, to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, as pos¬ 
sessions, creatures and servants, and this sovereignty contradicts having a child, and is expressed by [the 
particle] ma, ‘all that’, in order to include all [creation] that is not rational; all obey His will, submitting 
to that which is required from each one of them: here the emphasis is on rational beings. Creator of the heavens and the earth, making them exist without any exemplary precedent; and

yakunu: a variant reading has fa-yakuna, on account of it being the response [in the subjunctive mood] 
to the jussive statement). And they, that is the disbelievers of Mecca, who do not know, say, to the Prophet (s): ‘Why does 
God not Speak to us?, [to say] that you are His Messenger; Why does a sign not come to us?’, of the sort 
we have requested in order to show your sincerity. So, in the same way that these [disbelievers] have 
Spoken, Spoke those before them, from among pash communities, to their prophets, the like of what 
they say, in [their] obstinacy and demand for signs; their hearts are much alike, in terms of unbelief 
and stubbornness: this is meant as consolation for the Prophet (s). Yet We have made clear the signs to 
a people who are certain, [a people] who know that these are [God’s] signs and so they believe in them, 
for to request other signs would be obduracy. We have sent you, Muhammad (s), with the truth, the guidance, a bearer of good tidings, of 
Paradise, for those who respond to this [guidance], and Warner, of the Fire, to those who do not respond 
to it. You shall not be asked about the inhabitants of Hell-fire, that is, about why the disbelievers did not 
believe, for your responsibility is only to deliver the Message (a variant reading of Id tus’al is la tas’al, ‘do 
not ask’, with the final apocopation of the vowel on account of it being an imperative).","They say, “Allah has taken a son[49]”. Glory be to Him! Rather, to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and earth – all are devoutly obedient to Him. . The Originator of the heavens and earth. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, “Be,” and it is. . Those who have no knowledge[50] say, “If only Allah would speak to us or a sign be given to us.” Those who came before them said similar words. Their hearts are all alike. We have made the signs clear to people who have sure faith. . We have sent you with the truth [O Prophet] as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner, and you will not be questioned about the people of the Blazing Fire.","[49] The Jews claimed that Ezra was the son of God, the Christians claimed that Jesus was the son of God, and the Arab pagans claimed that the angels were God’s daughters. .

2,124,129,"And, mention, when his Lord tested, tried, Abraham ( Ibrahim: also read Ibraham) with certain 
words, with certain commands and prohibitions with which He charged him: it is said that these in¬ 
cluded the rituals of the Pilgrimage, the rinsing of the mouth, snuffing up water into the noStrils [to clean 
them], cleaning of the teeth, trimming facial hair, combing of the hair, trimming the fingernails, shaving 
armpit and pubic hair, circumcision and washing one’s private parts after elimination; and he fulfilled 
them, he performed them thoroughly; He, God, exalted, said, to him: ‘I make you a leader, an exemplar 
in religion, for the people.’ Said he, ‘And of my seed?’, my progeny, make leaders [from among them]; He 
said, ‘My covenant, of leadership, shall not reach the evildoers’, the disbelievers from among them: this 
indicates that [the covenant] will reach only those who are not evildoers. And when We appointed the House, the Ka'ba, to be a place of visitation, to which they

to yourselves Abraham’s Station, the founding Stone he used when building the House, for a place of 
prayer’, so that you perform two units of prayer for the circumambulation; And We made a covenant 
with Abraham and Ishmael, We commanded them: ‘Purify My House, of graven images, for those 
that shall go round it and those that cleave to it, in ritual residence, to those who bow and prostrate 
themselves’, that is, those who pray: ( al-rukka and al-sujud are the plurals of raki, ‘one bowing’, and 
sajid, ‘one prostrated’, respectively). And when Abraham said, ‘My Lord, make this, place, a land secure, in which there is safety: 
God granted him his request, making it a sanctuary in which no human blood is shed, no injustice is 
committed towards anyone, no prey is hunted and which is never deserted in any of its parts; and pro¬ 
vide its people with fruits: something which actually happened when there came itinerants from as far 
as Syria, whereas before, it had been devoid of any vegetation or water; such of them as believe in God 
and the LaSt Day’ (this phrase Stands in place of its people, and they are here singled out for mention 
in the request in accordance with God’s saying My covenant shall not reach the evildoers): He, exalted, 
said, And whoever disbelieves, I will also provide with fruits, to him I shall give enjoyment (read either 
umti’uhu or umattiuhu ), by granting him sustenance in this life, a little, the length of his life, but then 
I shall compel him, I shall drive him in the Hereafter to the chastisement of the Fire, so that he cannot 
find an escape — how evil a journey’s end!’, a place to which to return. And, mention, when Abraham raised up the foundations, the supports or the walls, of the 
House, building it ( min al-bayt, ‘of the House’, is semantically connected to yarfa‘u, ‘raises up’), and Ish¬ 
mael with him ( wa-Ismailu is a supplement to Ibrahimu), both of them saying: ‘Our Lord! Receive this, 
building, from us. Truly You are the Hearing, of words, the Knowing, of deeds. Our Lord! And make us submissive, compliant, to You and, make, of our seed, our progeny, a 
community, a people, submissive to You ( min [in the phrase min dhurriyyatina, ‘of our seed’] here is par¬

evildoers): and show us, teach us, our holy rites, our ceremonies for worship or for the pilgrimage, and 
relent to us. Surely You are the Relenting, the Merciful: they asked Him to turn towards them, despite 
their [moral] impeccability, out of humbleness and in order to teach their progeny. Our Lord! And send among them, the people of this House, a messenger, one of them and God 
granted him this petition with [the sending of] Muhammad (s), who shall recite to them Your signs,

the Qur’an, and teach them the Book, the Qur’an, and Wisdom, that is, what the former contains of 
judgements, and purify them, cleanse them of idolatry; You are the Mighty, the Vicftor, the Wise, in His 
creation.","And [remember] when Abraham was tested by his Lord with certain words, which he fulfilled[51]. Allah said, “I will make you a leader for mankind.” He said, “And from among my descendants?” Allah said, “My covenant does not include the wrongdoers.” . And [remember] when We made the House [i.e., Ka‘bah] a focal point and a sanctuary for the people. “[O believers], take the Station of Abraham as a place for prayer.” We charged Abraham and Ishmael to purify My House for those who perform circumambulation[52] or stay for worship, or those who bow down and prostrate. . And [remember] when Abraham said, “My Lord, make this city [of Makkah] a sanctuary and provide its people with fruits – those among them who believe in Allah and the Last Day.” [Allah] said, “As for those who disbelieve, I will grant them enjoyment for a short while, then I will force them into the punishment of the Fire. What a terrible destination!” . And [remember] when Abraham was raising the foundations of the House and Ishmael, [saying], “Our Lord, accept this from us, for You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. .

2,130,134,"Who therefore, meaning none’, shrinks from the religion of Abraham, abandoning it, except he 
who fools himself?, that is to say, either the one who ignores that his soul has been created for God, and 
that it is obliged to worship Him, or the one who treats it with frivolity and degrades it. Indeed We chose 
him. We elecfted him, in this world, for prophethood and friendship, and in the Hereafter he shall be 
among the righteous, those of the high stations [al-darajat al-‘ula, cf. Q. 20:75]. And mention: When his Lord said to him, ‘Submit’, obey God and devote your religion purely 
to Him, he said, ‘I have submitted to the Lord of the Worlds’. And Abraham enjoined (wassd; may also be read awsa) upon his sons this, creed, and [so did] 
Jacob, upon his sons, saying: ‘My sons, God has chosen for you the [true] religion, the religion of sub¬ 
mission [to God] ( isldm ), see that you die not save in submission: he forbade them from abandoning this 
submission [to God], and enjoined them to adhere firmly to it until death overtook them. When the Jews said to the Prophet (5), ‘Do you not know that on the day of his death Jacob 
charged his sons with Judaism?’, the following was revealed: Or, were you witnesses, present, when death 
came to Jacob? When ( idh, ‘when, substitutes for the preceding idh) he said to his sons, ‘What will you 
worship after me?’, after I die?; They said, ‘We will worship your God and the God of your fathers Abra¬ 
ham and Ishmael and Isaac (in recognition of the predominant [mention of the father figures] Ishmael 
is also counted as a father, and also because the Status of an uncle is akin to that of a father), One God 
(ildhan wahidan, ‘One God’, substitutes for ilahaka, ‘your God’), to Him we submit’ (the initial am [of the 
phrase am kuntum, ‘Or, were you ...’] is similar to the hamza of denial [sc. a-kuntum], the sense being, 
‘You were not present at his death, so how do you ascribe to him what does not befit him?’). That ( tilka, is the subject of this sentence and denotes Abraham, Jacob and his sons, and is femi¬ 
nine because it agrees with the gender of its predicate) is a community that has passed away, has gone 
before; theirs is what they have earned, the reward for their deeds ( laha ma kasabat, theirs is what they 
have earned’, constitutes the commencement of a new sentence) and yours (the Jews are being addressed 
here) is what you have earned; you shall not be asked about what they did, in the same way that they 
will not be asked about what you did, this latter Statement being an affirmation of the former.","Who would forsake the religion of Abraham[55] except a fool! We have chosen him in this world, and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous. . When his Lord said to him, “Submit[56],” he said, “I have submitted to the Lord of the worlds.” . This was enjoined by Abraham and Jacob to their offspring, “O my children, Allah has chosen for you this religion; so do not die except as Muslims.” . Or were you present when death approached Jacob, when he said to his children, “What will you worship after me”? They said, “We will worship your God and the God of your fathers – Abraham, Ishmael[57], and Isaac – the One God. And to Him we submit.” . That was a nation that has passed on; they will have what they earned and you will have what you earned, and you will not be questioned concerning what they used to do.","[55] The ‘religion of Abraham’, known as hanīfiyyah, is the most primordial, pristine and uncorrupted of all divine religions. The Qur’an underlines Islam’s close relation to it in various places. . [56] The meaning of the word ""Islam"" is ""submission to the will of Allah."" This is ordained by Allah and taught by all of the prophets from Adam to Muhammad (ﷺ). A Muslim is one who submits himself to Allah. . [57] Ishmael was actually Jacob’s paternal uncle. They counted him among Jacob’s ‘fathers’ out of respect."
2,135,138,"A/id they say, ‘Be Jews or Christians (the particle aw is for detail; the firSt of these is the saying of 
the Medinan Jews, while the second is that of the Christians of Najran), and you shall be guided’. Say, to 
them: ‘Nay, we follow, rather the creed of Abraham, a hanif (hanifan is a circumstantial qualifier refer¬ 
ring to Ibrahima, that is to say, one that inclines away from all other religions to the upright religion); 8 

and he was not of the idolaters’. Say: (this address is to the believers) ‘We believe in God, and in that which has been revealed 
to us, the Qur’an, and revealed to Abraham, the ten scrolls, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, his 
sons, and that which was given to Moses, the Torah, and Jesus, the GoSJiel, and the prophets, from their 
Lord, of Books and signs, we make no division between any of them, believing in some and disbelieving 
in others in the manner of Jews and Christians, and to Him we submit’. 

8 The essential meaning of the root h-n-f is to ‘incline’. Al-Raghib al-Isfahani (d. ca. 425/1033) in his famous lexicon of Qur’anic 
expressions, Mufradat aljdz al-Qur’an, ed. Safwan ‘Adnan Dawudi, 2 nd reprint, 1997, 3 rd reprint, 2002 (Damascus: Dar al-Qalam; 
Beirut: al-Dar al-Shamiyya), 260, Slates that al-hanaf means to ‘incline from misguidance towards uprightness, while al-janaf[-j- 
n-f] is to incline from uprightness towards misguidance’. In the Qur’an, the term is used to refer to one who believes in God but 
who is neither a Jew nor a Christian. A verse in the Qur’an (Q. 22:30-31) encourages people to ‘eschew falsehood and be hunafa’ 
to God’, which almost all commentators understand to mean ‘incline towards Him in sincere devotion, in the way that Abraham 
is said to have done. Thus, Abraham represents the ideal hanif and it is he who is mostly associated with this term in the Qur’an 
(see Q. 3:67; 16:120). Muslim exegetes also inform us that the term hanif was used in pre-Islamic times to refer to a person who 
performed the Abrahamic pilgrimage or who was circumcised. See W. Montgomery Watt, ‘hanif’, E12, m , 165b; also U. Rubin, 
‘hanif’, eq, ii, 402-404.

schism, in opposition to you; God will suffice you, O Muhammad (s), against them, and their schisms; 
He is the Hearer, of their sayings, the Knower, of their circumstances: God sufficed him [with regard to 
them] by killing Qurayza, expelling Nadir and exacting the jizya from them. The mark of God (sibghata’Lldhi: a verbal noun reaffirming the earlier amannd, and it is in the 
accusative, because of the verbal construction implied, that is to say, sabaghana’Llahu, ‘God has marked 
us’): this denotes His religion, the one towards which He made human beings naturally inclined, as it 
leaves its mark on a person, in the same way that a dye leaves its mark on a garment; and who has, that 
is, none [has], a better mark (sibghatan, ‘marking’, is for Specification) than God? And Him we worship: 
the Jews said to the Muslims, ‘We are the people of the firSt Book and our direction of prayer ( qibla ) is 
more ancient, and prophets were never sent from among the Arabs; if Muhammad were a prophet, he 
would have been one of us’. Thus, the following was revealed:","They say, “Be Jews or Christians to be guided.” Say, “Rather [we follow] the religion of Abraham, the monotheist, and he was not one of the polytheists[58].” . Say [O believers], “We believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us; and what was sent down to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the descendants [of Jacob][59]; and what was given to Moses and Jesus; and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we have submitted.” . If they believe as you have believed, then they are guided. But if they turn away, then they are in plain dissension. Allah will suffice you against them, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. . This is the natural religion[60] of Allah. Who is better than Allah in [enjoining a] religion? And it is He Whom we worship.","[58] i.e., those who associate others with Allah in worship. . [59] i.e., the twelve tribes of Israel descended from Jacob. . [60] “Sibghah” linguistically means ‘color’. It is so called because religious devoutness shows on the person as much as a dye of cloth shows on it."
2,139,141,"Say, to them: ‘Would you then dispute with us concerning God, that He chose a prophet from 
among the Arabs, and He is our Lord and your Lord?, and so it is for Him to choose whom He will, Our 
deeds belong to us, for which we will be requited, and to you belong your deeds, for which you will be 
requited, so that it is not improbable that among our deeds there will be those for which we will deserve 
to be honoured; and to Him we are sincerely devoted, in religion and in deed, unlike you, hence, we are 
more worthy to be chosen (the hamza [of a-tuhajjunand, ‘would you then dispute’] is for rejection, and 
the three clauses that follow it are all circumstantial qualifiers). Or, nay, do you say (taquluna, also read yaquluna, ‘do they say?’): ‘Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac 
and Jacob, and the Tribes — they were Jews, or they were Christians?’ Say, to them: ‘Have you then 
greater knowledge, or has God?, that is, God has greater knowledge; He dissociated Abraham from both 
[groups], when He said, Abraham was not a Jew, nor a Christian [Q. 3:67]; and those mentioned with him 
[Abraham] are his followers [in not belonging to either group]. And who does greater injustice than he 
who conceals, hides from people, a testimony, he has, received from God?, that is, there is none more 
unjuSt than him: these are the Jews, for they concealed God’s testimony about Abraham’s pure faith in 
the Torah; And God is not heedless of what you do’: [this is] a threat for them. That is a community that has passed away; theirs is what they have earned, and yours is what 
you have earned; you shall not be asked about what they did: a similar [verse] has already been men¬ 
tioned above.","Say, “Do you [People of the Book] argue with us concerning Allah, when He is our Lord and your Lord? We are responsible for our deeds and you for yours, and we are sincerely devoted to Him. . Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the descendants [of Jacob] were Jews or Christians?” Say, “Are you more knowledgeable or Allah?” Who does greater wrong than the one who hides a testimony he has from Allah? But Allah is not unaware of what you do. . That was a nation that has passed on; they will have what they earned and you will have what you earned, and you will not be questioned concerning what they used to do.",
2,142,145,"The fools, the ignorant, among the people, that is, the Jews and the idolaters, will say, ‘What, 
matter, has turned them, the Prophet (s) and the believers, from the direction they were facing in their 
prayers formerly?’, this being the Holy House ( bayt al-maqdis, sc. Jerusalem); the sin [of sa-yaqulu, ‘they 
will say’] denotes the future tense and informs of the Unseen. Say: ‘To God belong the EaSt and the WeSt, 
that is, all directions. Thus He commands that they face whichever direction He wills, and there can be 
no objection. He guides whomever He will. His guidance being, to a Straight path’, that is, the religion 
of Islam, and you are among these [guided ones]. Thus, in the same way that We guided you to it, We appointed you, O community of Muhammad 
(s), a midmoSt community, excellent and upright, that you might be witnesses to the people, on the Day 
of Resurrection, that their messengers delivered [the Message] to them; and that the Messenger might 
be a witness to you, that he delivered [the Message] to you, and We did not appoint, make, the direction, 
for you now, the direction, you were facing, that is the Ka'ba: the Prophet (s) used to face it in prayer, but 
when he emigrated he was commanded to face the Holy House [of Jerusalem], in order to win the hearts 
of the Jews. He prayed in this direction for sixteen or seventeen months before he changed direction; 
except that We might know, [that it become] manifest knowledge, who followed the Messenger, and 
believed in him, from him who turned on his heels, and returned to unbelief doubting the religion and 
thinking that the Prophet (s) was confused about this issue; and a number of them apostatised as a result 
of this— though it, the change of direction, were ( wa-in, ‘though’, is softened, and its noun apocopated, 
originally being: wa-innaha) a grave thing, troublesome for people, save for those, of them, whom God 


20 


Sura al-Baqara 

has guided; but God would never cause your faith, that is, your prayers towards the Holy House [of 
Jerusalem], to be wafted, but He will reward you for them (the reason that this [verse] was revealed was 
that some had asked about the status of those that had died before the change of direction [of prayer]); 
truly, God is Gentle with, believing , people. Merciful, when He does not let their deeds go to waste (al- 
rafa means ‘intensity of mercy’, and is mentioned hrff to allow for the end rhyme of the verse [with the 
preceding one]). Wfe have indeed ( qad , ‘indeed’, is for affirmation) seen you turning your face about in the, direc¬ 
tion of the, heaven, looking around for the Revelation and longing for the command to face the Ka'ba: 
he [the Prophet] wished for this because it was the prayer-direction of Abraham and would be more 
conducive to the submission of the Arabs [to Islam]; now We will surely turn you to a direction that 
shall satisfy you, that you will love. Turn your face, in prayer, towards the Sacred Mosque, that is, the 
Ka'ba, and wherever you are (addressing the [Muslim] community) turn your faces, in prayer, towards 
it. Those who have been given the Scripture know that it, the change towards the Ka'ba, is the, fixed, 
truth from their Lord, on account of the description in their Scripture of how the Prophet (s) would 
re-orient himself to it; God is not heedless of what you do, O believers, when you obey His command 
(alternatively, tamaluna, ‘you do’, can be read yamaluna, ‘they do’, in other words [it would be referring 
to] the Jews’ denial of the matter concerning the direction of prayer). Yet if (wa-la-in: the lam is for oaths) you should bring to those who have been given the Scrip¬ 
ture every sign, about your truthfulness in the matter of the direction of prayer, they will not follow your 
direction, out of obduracy, and you are not a follower of their direction (this is a categorical negation of 
his [the Prophet’s] desire that they become Muslims and of their desire that he return to their direction 
of prayer; neither are they, the Jews and the Christians, followers of one another’s direction. If you were 
to follow their whims, the ones to which they summon you, after the knowledge, the revelation, that has 
come to you, then you, if, hypothetically, you were to follow them, will surely be among the evildoers.","The foolish among the people will say: “What has turned them away from their prayer direction they used to face[61]?” Say: “To Allah belong the east and west: He guides whom He wills to a straight path.” . Thus We made you a balanced nation, so that you may be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger a witness over you. We did not change your former direction of prayer [to the Ka‘bah] except to distinguish those who would follow the Messenger from those who would turn back on their heels. It was surely burdensome except for those whom Allah guided. Allah would never let your [acts of] faith go to waste, for Allah is Most Gracious and Most Merciful to all people. . We see the turning of your face [O Prophet] towards heaven[62]; We will surely make you turn towards a prayer direction that will please you. So turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque [in Makkah], and wherever you are, turn your faces towards it. Those who were given the Scripture know that this is the truth from their Lord, and Allah is not unaware of what they do. . Even if you were to bring every proof to those who have been given the Scripture, they would not follow your prayer direction, nor would you follow their prayer direction; nor would any of them follow the prayer direction of the other. However, if you were to follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you, then you would surely be among the wrongdoers.","[61] Prior to the command (in verse 144) that the Prophet (ﷺ) and his followers turn toward the Ka‘bah in Makkah for prayer, they had been facing Jerusalem to the north. Further details are mentioned in succeeding verses. . [62] The Prophet (ﷺ) was awaiting the command to change the qiblah; so he used to look up at the sky."
2,146,150,"Those to whom We have given the Scripture, they recognise him, Muhammad (s), as they rec¬ 
ognise their sons, because of the descriptions of him in their Scripture: [‘Abd Allah] Ibn Salam 9 said, ‘I 
recognised him the moment I saw him, as I would my own son; but my recognition of Muhammad (s) 
was more intense’; even though there is a party of them that conceal the truth, that is, his description, 
while they know, this [truth] which you [Muhammad (s)] follow. The truth comes from your Lord; then be not among the doubters, who doubt it, that is to say, 

‘ [be not] of such a disposition’, which is more eloquent than merely saying, ‘do not waver’. Every person, of every community, has his direction ( wijha ), [his] qibla, to which he turns 
(muwalliha , ‘he turns to it’, is also read as muwallahd, ‘he is made to turn to it’), in his prayers, so vie with 
one another in good works. Strive with aCts of obedience and acceptance of these. Wherever you may 
be, God will bring you all together, gathering you on the Day of Resurrection and requiting you for your 
deeds; surely God has power over all things. From whatever place you issue, on a journey, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; it is 
the truth from your Lord. God is not heedless of what you do ( tamaluna , ‘you do’, may also be read as 
yamaluna, ‘they do’, as already appears above [sc. 2:144]; its repetition is intended to point out that the 
Stipulation applies equally to being on a journey or otherwise). From whatever place you issue, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; and wherever you 
may be, turn your faces towards it (all of which is being repeated for emphasis), so that there be not any 
argument from the people, the Jews or the idolaters, again ft you, [so that there be not] any cause for 
contention regarding the change to a different direction of prayer. In this way, their contentions againSt 
you will cease to exiSt, both [the contentions] of the Jews when they say, ‘He [Muhammad (s)] rejects our 
religion, but follows our direction of prayer’, and of the idolaters when they say, ‘He [Muhammad (s)] 

9 ‘Abd Allah b. Salam was a Jew of Medina of the Banu Qaynuqa”. The Prophet gave him the name of ‘Abd Allah when he embraced 
Islam (previously al-Husayn). He is primarily representative, in Muslim tradition, of those Jewish scribes who recognised the truth 
of Muhammad’s prophethood; see Josef Horovitz, s.v. “Abd Allah b. Salam’, E12, 1, 52.

Tafsir al-Jaldlayn 

claims to follow the creed of Abraham, but he contravenes his [Abraham’s] qibla; excepting the evildo¬ 
ers among them, acting in obstinacy, who will say, ‘He [Muhammad (s)] only changed to this direction 
because of his [natural] inclination towards the [idolatrous] religion of his forefathers’. The exceptive 
statement [indicated by ilia ] is a continuous one, the meaning being: ‘No one will have anything to say 
against you, except for what these people say’; and do not fear them, do not fear their arguing [with you] 
regarding the change to it [the Ka'baj, but fear Me, by complying with My command; and that I may 
perfect My grace upon you, by guiding you to the principal rituals of your religion, and that you may 
be guided, to the truth ( wa-li-utimma, ‘that I may perfecft’, is a supplement to li-alla yakuna, ‘that there 
be not’).","Those whom We gave the Scripture recognize him [i.e., the Prophet] as they recognize their own sons, yet a group of them conceals the truth knowingly[63]. . It is the truth from your Lord; so never be among those who doubt. . Every nation has a direction to which it turns, so compete with one another in good deeds. Wherever you are, Allah will bring you all together, for Allah is Most Capable of all things. . From wherever you set out, turn your face to the direction of the Sacred Mosque [in Makkah]. This is surely the truth from your Lord, and Allah is not unaware of what you do. . From wherever you set out, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque [i.e., Ka‘bah]. Wherever you are, turn your faces towards it, so that the people should not have any proof against you[64], except for the wrongdoers among them. So do not fear them but fear Me, so that I may complete My favor upon you [all] and that you may be guided.",[63] That the Ka‘bah is the correct direction of Prayer. . [64] One of the reasons for the change of qiblah was so that the Jews would have no argument against the Muslims.
2,151,153,"As also We have sent (this [verbal clause ka-ma arsalnd, ‘as We have sent’] is semantically con¬ 
nected to wa-li-utimma [of the previous verse], that is to say, ‘ [Also We have sent] by way of perfection’); 
as it [My grace] has been perfected by Our sending, among you, of yourselves, Muhammad (s), a mes¬ 
senger, to recite Our verses, the Qur’an, to you and to purify you, to cleanse you from idolatry, and to 
teach you the Book, the Qur’an, and wisdom, the rulings therein, and to teach you what you knew not. So remember Me, through prayer, glorification and the like, I will remember you: this is said to 
mean, ‘I will reward you’; in a hadith about God [that He says]: ‘whoever remembers Me in himself, I 
will remember him in Myself, and whoever remembers Me in an assembly, I will remember him in an 
Assembly more excellent than his’; and be thankful to Me, for My grace, by being obedient, and be not 
ungrateful towards Me, through disobedience. O you who believe, seek help, regarding the Hereafter, through patience, in obedience and afflic¬ 
tions, and prayer (He singles it out for mention on account of its frequency and its greatness); surely 
God is with the patient, helping them.","Just as We have sent you a messenger from among you, reciting to you Our verses, purifying you, and teaching you the Book and Wisdom[65], and teaching you what you did not know. . Therefore remember Me; I will remember you[66]. Be grateful to Me, and do not be ungrateful. . O you who believe, seek help in patience and prayer, for Allah is with those who are patient[67].","[65] The wisdom taught by the Prophet (ﷺ) is his Sunnah. . [66] Remember Me (by praying, glorifying, etc), and I will remember you (by remembering you and bestowing countless favors on you). Allah says in a Qudsi Hadith: ""...If he remembers Me in himself, I remember him in Myself; and if he remembers Me in a group, I remember him in a group better than them..."" [Al-Bukhāri and Muslim] . [67] Allah is with them; by guiding and supporting them."
2,154,157,"And say not of those slain in God’s way, that, 'They are dead’; rather they are living, their spirits 
are, according to a hadith, contained in green birds that take wing freely wherever they wish in Paradise; 
but you are not aware, [but you] do not know their condition. Surely We will try you with something of fear, of an enemy, and hunger, by way of drought, and 
diminution of goods, as a result of destruction, and lives, as a result of slaughter, death and disease, and 
fruits, by way of crop damage: that is to say, We will try you to see if you practise patience or not; yet give 
good tidings, of Paradise, to the patient, during calamities; those who, when they are ftruck by an affliction, a calamity, say, ‘Surely we belong to God, we 
are His possession and servants, with whom He does as He pleases; and to Him we will return’, in the 
Hereafter, whereupon He will requite us: in one hadith [it is said that], ‘whoever pronounces the iftirja 
[sc. the formula ‘surely we belong to God and to Him we will return] when an affliction befalls him, God 
will reward him and compensate him with what is better’. Similarly, it is said that on one occasion when 
his lamp blew out, the Prophet (s) uttered the iftirja, whereupon ‘A’isha' 0 said to him, saying: ‘But, it is 
ju^t a lamp’, to which he replied, ‘Whatever bothers a believer is an affliction [of sorts]’: this is reported 

10 ‘A’isha, Umm ‘Abd Allah ‘A’isha bint Abi Bakr (d. 58/678) was the youngest wife of the Prophet and the daughter of the first 
caliph. She was an important source for Prophetic narrations and opinions on the commentary of the Qur’an. See W. Montgomery 
Watt, s.v. “A’isha’, E12, 1, 307-8; Ibn Sa‘d, Tabaqat, vm, 39-56.

Sura al-Baqara 

by Abu Dawud in his [section on] mursal reports. 11 Upon those reft blessings, forgiveness, and mercy, grace, from their Lord, and those — they are 
the truly guided, to redtitude.","And do not say that those martyred in Allah’s way are dead. Rather, they are alive, but you do not perceive it. . We will surely test you with something of fear and famine, and loss of property, lives and fruits. But give glad tidings[68] to those who are patient. . Those when afflicted with a disaster, say, “We belong to Allah, and to Him we will return.” . They are those upon whom are blessings and mercy from their Lord, and it is they who are guided.","[68] As much as there are hardships and trials, there are rewards and favors."
2,158,158,"Truly Safa and Marwa, two mountains near Mecca, are among the waymarks ( sha’air, plural of 
sha’ira) of God, the [ritual] ceremonies of His religion, so whoever makes the Pilgrimage to the House, 
or the Visitation, that is, whoever prepares to perform the Pilgrimage [hajj] or the Visitation [' umra ]: 
the original sense of both terms [hajja and itamara] is ‘to aim for’ and ‘to visit’, repetitively; he woidd 
not be at fault, [it would not be] a sin, if he circumambulates them (the original ta [of yatatawwafa, 
circumambulate’] has been assimilated with the ta’), by pacing quickly (say) between them seven times: 
this was revealed when the Muslims were averse to this [circumambulation], because the pagan Arabs 
used to circumambulate them, and there was an idol atop each mountain which they used to stroke. It 
is reported from Ibn ‘Abbas that this pacing [between the two] is not obligatory, based on the fad: that 
when no sin can be incurred, the context implies free choice. Al-Shafi'I and others, however, considered 
it to be a pillar [of the Pilgrimage rituals]. The Prophet made clear its obligatory aped: when he said 
that, ‘God has prescribed for you the pacing [sa’y]’, as reported by al-Bayhaql 12 and others; and he [the 
Prophet] also said, ‘Begin with what God has begun, meaning, al-Safa, as reported by Muslim; and who¬ 
ever volunteers (tatawwaa : a variant reading is yattawa, the ta’here being assimilated) good, that is, any 
good deed such as circumambulation or other, that is not obligatory on him; God is Grateful, for such a 
deed and rewards that person for it, Knowing, it.","Indeed, Safa and Marwah [mounts] are among the symbols of Allah. So whoever performs the pilgrimage or ‘Umra, there is no blame upon him to go between them[69]. And whoever does good voluntarily, then Allah is All-Appreciative, All-Knowing.","[69] Some believers had previously feared that this might be a pagan practice, so Allah confirms that this is among the rites of Islam."
2,159,162,"The following was revealed concerning the Jews: Those who conceal, from people, the clear proofs 
and the guidance that We have revealed, such as the ‘doning’ verse and the description of Muhammad 
(5), after We have shown them clearly in the Scripture, the Torah — they shall be cursed by God, that is, 
He will move them far away from His mercy, and by the cursers, the angels, believers, or by every single 
thing, when they supplicate that they be cursed. Except those that repent, turning back from such [deeds], and make amends, in their adions, 
and show clearly, what they were concealing — them I shall turn [relenting], accepting their repent¬ 
ance; I am the Relenting, the Merciful, to believers. But those who disbelieve, and die disbelieving ( wa-hum kuffar, ‘they being disbelievers’, is a cir¬ 
cumstantial qualifier) — upon them shall be the curse of God and the angels, and of people altogether, 
that is, they deserve such [a curse] in this life and in the next; ‘people’ here is said to be either [people] 
in general, or believers. Abiding therein, that is, [in] the curse and the Fire, [the latter] indicated by the following words: 
the chastisement shall not be lightened for them, [not even for] a blink of an eye, no respite shall be 
given them, in which to have time to repent or to excuse themselves. 

11 Abu Dawud Sulayman b. Dawud al-Tayalisi (d. 203/818) was a Basran traditionisl narrating from Sufyan al-Thawri. See Gaultier 
H. A. Juynboll, s.v ‘al-Tayalisi’, E12, x, 398-99; al-Dhahabi, Tadhkira, 1, 351-52; Ibn Sa'd, Tabaqdt, vii , 298; GAS 1,97-98. His mus- 
nad has been edited by A. ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Banna as Minhat al-Ma'bud fi tartlb musnad al-Tayalisi Abi Dawud, 2 parts in r 
(Cairo, r372/r952); cf. P. Marston Speight, ‘Attitudes towards Christians in the Musnad of al-Tayalisi’, MW 63 (1973), 249-68. As 
for marasil, plural of mursal, these types of hadiths formed an important sub-category within the system of hadith classification. 
Technically Sneaking, a hadith described as being mursal, ‘unattached’, was one in which the isnad, or chain of transmitters, seems 
to contain a missing link between the Prophet (the first link) and the first transmitter, usually because that firSt transmitter is either 
not known to have been a contemporary of the Prophet — and so mud have received the report from some other person — or 
he is actually known not to have been a contemporary. This category was later expanded by some hadith scholars to comprise all 
reports with one missing link, regardless of whether it occurred in the chain immediately after the Prophet or not. DeSjfite the fad 
that such a class of hadith might warrant the qualification of being unreliable, a mass of mursal reports were accepted by hadith 
scholars and constitute an important segment of the larger body of acceptable hadiths. The reason why this class of hadith was so 
readily accepted was that many of these reports were transmitted by highly-receded early legal authorities and contained Pro¬ 
phetic sayings and deeds which, in the period before the crystallisation of the legal madhahib, or ‘schools of religious law’, had a 
considerable bearing on matters of law and ritual; see J. Burton, An Introduction to the Hadith (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University 
Press, 1994), rraf.

Tafsir al-Jaldlayn","Those who conceal the clear proofs and guidance that We have sent down – after We explained it clearly to people in the Scripture – it is they who are cursed by Allah and will be cursed by those who curse[70]. .

2,163,164,"When they asked him [Muhammad (s)] to describe his Lord, the following was revealed: Your 
God, the One deserving of your worship, is One God, without any equal in either essence or attribute; 
there is no god except Him, He is the Compassionate, the Merciful. They then asked for a sign to prove this, and the following was revealed: Surely in the creation 
of the heavens and the earth, and the marvels contained in them, and the alternation of the night and 
day, passing and returning, increasing and diminishing, and the ships that run in the sea, and do not 
become cracked and sink, with what profits men, of trade and merchandise, and the water, the rain, God 
sends down from the heaven with which He revives the earth, with vegetation, after it is dead, after it 
has dried out, and He scatters abroad in it all manner of crawling thing, by dividing them and Spreading 
them throughout on account of the vegetation, for they thrive on the fertile pastures it produces; and the 
disposition of the winds, changing it from south to north, from cold to warm, and the clouds compelled, 
subjugated by God’s command, moving to wherever God wishes, between heaven and the earth, without 
being attached [to either of the two] — surely there are signs, indicating His Oneness, exalted be He, for 
a people who comprehend, [a people] who contemplate.","And your god is one God. None has the right to be worshiped except Him – the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful. . Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and earth; the alternation of the night and day; the sailing of the ships in the sea for the benefit of people; the sending down of rain from the sky by Allah, reviving thereby the earth after its death; the spreading of all kinds of creatures therein; the directing of the winds and clouds between the sky and earth – in all these, there are signs[71] for people of understanding.",[71] There are two āyāt (signs) leading to belief: Quranic verses and cosmic signs. The signs meant in this verse are cosmic.
2,165,167,"Yet there be people who take to themselves compeers, idols, besides God, that is, other than God, 
loving them, by magnifying them and being subservient to them, as God is loved, that is, as their love 
of Him; but those who believe love God more ardently, than those who love their compeers, because 
the former never rejecft God, whereas the latter when faced with hardship soon abandon those [com¬ 
peers] for God; If he, [if you] O Muhammad (s), were to see those who did evil, by taking to themselves 
compeers, when ( idh here denotes idha) they see (read either as acftive [ yarawna, ‘they see’] or passive 
[yurawna, ‘they are made to see’]) the chastisement, you would see a grave sight, that, this is because, the 
might, the power and the vanquishing, altogether (a circumstantial qualifier) belongs to God, and that 
God is terrible in chastisement (according to one reading, the person listening [to the verse] governs 
the verb yard, ‘he sees’, and constitutes the subject [of the clause]; according to another [reading], it is 
the ‘evildoers’ [who constitute the subject of the clause and govern the verb yard]; and so it [yard] has 
the sense of yalam, ‘he knows’; the particle an, ‘that’, and what comes after it have taken the place of the 
objects in both cases; the response to the [initial conditional] law, ‘if’, has been omitted). The general 
meaning [of the verse] then is: ‘If they were aware in this world of the severity of God’s chastisement and 
of the facft that power is God’s alone, the moment they come to see it with their own eyes, on the Day of 
Resurrection, they would not take to themselves compeers’. When ( idh here substitutes for the previous idh) those who were followed, that is, the leaders, 
disown their followers, that is to say, [when] they have denied misleading them [the latter], and they 
have seen the chastisement, and the cords, the bonds of affeCtion and kinship that were between them 
on earth, are cut away before them, from them ( taqattaat, ‘cut away’, is a supplement to tabarra’a, 
‘disown’). And those who followed say, ‘O, if only we might return again, to the world, and disown them, 
the ones who had been followed, as they have disowned us!’, on this day (the particle law, ‘if only’, is 
an optative, and its response is natabarra’a, ‘we disown). So, juSt as He showed them the severity of His 
chastisement and their disowning of one another, so too, God shall show them their, evil, works, as, an¬ 
guish ( hasardt is a circumstantial qualifier), regrets, for them! Never shall they exit from the Fire, once 
they have entered it.","And among people, there are some who take others as equals to Allah[72]: they love them as they should love Allah. But those who believe are stronger in their love for Allah. If only the wrongdoers could see the punishment, they would surely realize that all power belongs to Allah and that Allah is severe in punishment. . [Consider] when those who were followed, they will disown their followers when they see the punishment, and all ties between them will be cut off. . The followers will say, “If only we could have another chance, so we could disown them as they have disowned us.” Thus will Allah show them their deeds as sources of regret, and they will never get out of the Fire.","[72] In spite of all these clear signs, some people still worship false deities besides Allah."
2,168,169,"The following was revealed when some said that it was unlawful to take a camel that has been 
let loose ( sawa’ib ): O people, eat of what is in the earth, lawful ( halalan is a circumstantial qualifier) 
and wholesome (tayyiban is an adjeCtive for emphasis), that is to say, what is delicious; and follow not 
the Steps, the ways, of Satan, meaning, what he embellishes [of temptations]; he is a manifest foe to you, 
whose enmity is clear; he only commands you to evil, sin, and indecency, what is abhorred by the Law, and that 
you should Speak againSt God what you do not know, such as forbidding what He has not forbidden 
and otherwise.

Sura al-Baqara","O people, eat from what is lawful and good[73] on earth, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan, for he is your sworn enemy. . He only orders you to commit evil and immoral deeds, and to say concerning Allah what you do not know[74].","[73] Two conditions for consuming food: lawful, and beneficial; not harmful. . [74] Falsely claiming that Allah made one thing lawful and another unlawful."
2,170,171,"And when it is said to them, the disbelievers, ‘Follow what God has revealed’, pertaining to af¬ 
firmation of God’s Oneness and the good things that He has made lawful, they say, ‘No; but we follow 
what we found our fathers doing’, in the way of idol-worship, deeming unlawful the camel let loose, 
and [practising] the slitting of the camel’s ear (sc. bahira). God says: What? (the hamza [of a-wa-law ] 
is for repudiation), do they follow them, Even if their fathers do not understand anything, concerning 
religion, and they were not guided?, to the truth. The likeness, the attribute, of those who disbelieve, and the one who calls them to guidance, is 
as the likeness of one who shouts to that which hears nothing, save a call and a cry, only a sound, not 
understanding its meaning: when they listen to an admonition they are like cattle that hear the cry of 
their shepherd but do not understand what he is saying; they are deaf, dumb, blind — they do not com¬ 
prehend, any admonition.","When it is said to them, “Follow what Allah has sent down,” they say, “Instead, we follow what we found our forefathers doing.” [Would they do so] even though their forefathers had no understanding, nor were they guided? . The similitude of those who disbelieved is like cattle not understanding the calls of the shepherd except shouts and cries. They are deaf, dumb, and blind[75]; and they understand nothing.",[75] Their senses are not tuned to divine admonition.
2,172,173,"Oyou who believe, eat of the good things, that are lawful, wherewith We have provided you, and 
give thanks to God, for what He has made lawful for you, if it be Him that you worship. He has only forbidden you: carrion, that is, the consumption of it, since this is the subject of 
the general address here, and similarly [the consumption of] what follows, [all of] which is what has not 
been slaughtered in accordance with [prescriptions of] the Law; to this the Sunna adds [as also constitut¬ 
ing carrion] what has been severed from a living creature. A Special Status is, however, accorded fish and 
locuSts; 13 blood, poured forth, as in [siirat] al-An'am [see Q. 6:145], the flesh of swine, the meat is singled 
out for mention because that [part] is what people moStly seek, every other [part] being implied thereby; 
what has been hallowed to other than God, that is to say, what has been slaughtered in other than His 
Name ( al-ihldl is the raising of one’s voice, which they used to do when sacrificing for their gods). Yet 
whoever is constrained, forced by dire need to eat of the above-mentioned, not desiring, to rebel againSt 
Muslims, nor transgressing, committing aggression againSt them by waylaying them, no sin shall be on 
him, for eating it. God is Forgiving, to His friends, Merciful, to those who are obedient to Him, for He 
has granted them wide berth in this matter. The aggressor and the transgressor are excluded from this 
[dispensation], and to these two [categories] one should also add every person that sets out on a journey 
in disobedience, such as the fugitive or the excise collector, 14 for whom it would be unlawful to eat any of 
the mentioned, unless they repent [of their disobedience]; this is the opinion of al-Shafi'i.","O you who believe, eat of the good things[76] We have provided for you, and be grateful to Allah, if you truly worship Him alone. . He has only forbidden to you carrion, blood, the flesh of swine, and what has been sacrificed to other than Allah. But if someone is compelled by necessity – neither driven by desire nor exceeding immediate need – then there is no sin upon him; for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",[76] Healthy and wholesome.
2,174,176,"Those who conceal what God has revealed of the Scripture, comprising all the descriptions of 
Muhammad (s), meaning the Jews, and sell it for a little price, in this world, taking this [little price] in 
its place from the debased ones among them, for fear of losing out if they were to manifest it [sc. the 
truth of Muhammad (s)] — they shall consume nothing in their bellies but the Fire, because that is their 
journey’s end; God shall not Speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, out of anger with them, neither 
purify them, from the filth of sin; and theirs is a painful chastisement, that is, the Fire. Those are they that have bought error at the price of guidance, taking the former in place of 
the latter in this world, and chastisement at the price of pardon, [the pardon] that would have been 
prepared for them in the Hereafter, had they not concealed this matter; what makes them so patient 
for the Fire?, that is, how great is the extent of their patience? This [Statement] is intended to provoke 
amazement in the believers at the way in which they [the disbelievers] commit sins that necessitate their 
punishment in the Fire with complete indifference. In reality they would have no patience whatever [to 
endure the Fire]. 

13 According to the Sunna, al-mayta, ‘dead creatures’ including any part that has been severed from a live animal, may not be con¬ 
sumed save in exceptional circumstances, as these are considered ‘impure’ ( najas ). The only creatures exempt from this Stipulation, 
and which may be consumed even if dead, are fish and locuSts. 

14 In other words, the dispensation to eat of these unlawful things is not extended to those who might find themselves in dire need 
of food while engaging in action which is considered unlawful. The institution of the maks, a sort of excise ( makkas , being the col¬ 
lector of such a tax), already existed in the pre-Islamic markets of Arabia. This excise was carried over into Islam, where it became 
controversial, never being sanctioned by the schools of law. Howbeit, the exaction of this tax was widespread, as well as widely de¬ 
tested: there was nothing that could not be taxed. In Egypt, such duties are even said to have contributed to economic decline in the 
pre-Mamluk period. Al-Suytitl clearly frowned upon this maks — juxtaposing it as he does to other categories of illegal behaviour 
— and this led him to compose a work criticising it; for this reference and the background to maks, see the article by W. Bjorkman, 
‘maks’, E12, vi, i94f.; cf. also Joseph Schacht, An Introduction to Islamic Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1964), 8, 76 n.i.

Tafsir al-Jalalayn That, which has been mentioned of their eating of the Fire and what follows it, is because God 
has revealed the Book with the truth, but they are at variance regarding it, believing in parts of it while 
disbelieving in others, and concealing them; and those that are at variance regarding the Book, con¬ 
cerning this matter, namely, the Jews — although it is said that these are the idolaters some of whom 
said, with regard to the Qur’an, that it was poetry, others, that it was sorcery, and others ftill, that it was 
divination — are in schism, disagreement, far removed, from the truth.","Those who conceal the revelation of Allah’s Book and purchase thereby a small price, consume nothing into their bellies except fire. Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He purify them, and for them there will be a painful punishment. . They are those who trade guidance for misguidance and forgiveness for punishment. How patient they must be to withstand the Fire[77]! . That is because Allah has sent down the Book in truth. And those who differ over the Book are surely in extreme dissension.",[77] Allah is mocking their ignorance for exchanging bliss of Paradise with punishment of Hellfire.
2,177,177,"It is not piety, that you turn your faces, in prayer, to the Eafl and to the Weft. This was revealed 
in re^Jionse to the claim made by the Jews and the Christians to this effecft. True piety, that is, the pious 
person ( al-birr, is also read al-barr, in the sense of al-bdrr [‘the dutiful person]) is [that of] the one who 
believes in God and the Lafl Day and the angels and the Book, that is, the scriptures, and the prophets, 
and who gives of his sub fiance, however, deSJiite [it being], cherished, by him, to kinsmen and orphans 
and the needy and the traveller and beggars, and for, the setting free of, slaves, both the captive and the 
one to be manumitted by contract; 15 and who observes prayer and pays the alms, that are obligatory, 
and what was [given] before [alms were made obligatory], in the way of charity; and those who fulfil 
their covenant when they have engaged in a covenant, with God or with others, those who endure with 
fortitude ( al-sdbirina is the accusative of laudation) misfortune ( al-ba’sa is abjed poverty), hardship, 
illness, and peril, at the height of a battle in the way of God; these, described in the way mentioned, are 
the ones who are truthfid, in their faith and in their claims to piety, and these are the ones who are fear¬ 
ful, of God.","It is not righteousness to turn your faces towards the east or the west, but righteousness is to believe in Allah, the Last Day, the angels, the Scriptures, and the prophets; and to give charity out of one’s cherished wealth to relatives, orphans, the needy, the wayfarer, beggars, and to free slaves; to establish prayer and give zakah; to fulfill the ratified pledges; to be patient at times of hardship, adversity, and during the battle. Such are the true believers, and such are the righteous.",
2,178,179,"Oyou who believe, prescribed, made obligatory, for you is retaliation, on equal terms, regarding 
the slain, both in the attributes [of the one slain] and in the acftion involved; a free man, is killed, for a 
free man, and not for a slave; and a slave for a slave, and a female for a female. The Sunna makes it clear 
that a male may be killed [in retaliation] for a female, and that religious affiliation should be taken into 
account also, so that a Muslim cannot be killed in return for an disbeliever, even if the former be a slave 
and the latter a free man. But if anything, of the blood, is pardoned any one, of those who have slain, in 
relation to his brother, the one slain, so that the retaliation is waived (the use of the indefinite shay’un, 
‘anything’, here implies the waiving of retaliation through a partial pardon by the inheritors [of the slain]; 
the mention of akhih [‘his brother’] is intended as a conciliatory entreaty to pardon and a declaration 
that killing should not sever the bonds of religious brotherhood; the particle man, ‘any one’, is the subject 
of a conditional or a relative clause, of which the predicate is [the following, fa ’ittibaun]) let the pursu¬ 
ing, that is, the acftion of the one who has pardoned in pursuing the killer, be honourable, demanding the 
blood money without force. The facft that the ‘pursuing’ results from the ‘pardoning’ implies that one of 
the two [acftions] is a duty, which is one of al-ShafiTs two opinions here. The other [opinion] is that retali¬ 
ation is the duty, whereas the blood money is merely compensation [for non-retaliation], so that if one 
were to pardon but not name his blood money, then nothing [happens]; and this [latter] is the preferred 
[opinion]. And let the payment, of the blood money by the slayer, to him, the pardoner, that is, the one 
inheriting [from the slain], be with kindliness, without procrastination or fraud; that. Stipulation men¬ 
tioned here about the possibility of retaliation and the forgoing of this in return for blood money, is an 
alleviation, a facilitation, given, to you, by your Lord, and a mercy, for you, for He has given you latitude 
in this matter and has not categorically demanded that one [of the said options] be followed through, in 
the way that He made it obligatory for Jews to retaliate and for Christians to [pardon and] accept blood 
money; and for him who commits aggression, by being unjuSt towards the killer and slaying him, after 
that, that is, [after] pardoning — his is a painful chaftisement, of the Fire in the Hereafter, or of being 
killed in this world. In retaliation there is life for you, that is great longevity, O people of pith ,' 6 possessors of intel¬ 
lect because if the would-be killer knew that he would be killed [in retaliation], he would refrain [from 
such acftion] and would have thereby given life to himself and to the one whom he had intended to kill; 

15 On this legal institution, where a slave may be manumitted by fulfilling a contrad, made with his maSter, containing a financial 
obligation, see Q. 9:160, n. 9. 

16 The word lubb , plural albab , denotes a ‘kernel’ or ‘pith’, that is, the innermost or quintessence of a thing. We have chosen to keep 
a literal translation that also allows for a figurative interpretation, and in order to retain the Jalalayn gloss, which is modly given as 
dhawi l- e uqul, ‘possessors of intelled’, sometimes, ashab al-‘uqul, ‘people of intelled’.

Sura al-Baqara 

and so it [retaliation] was stipulated by the Law, so that you might fear killing, fearing retaliation.","O you who believe, legal retribution is prescribed for you in cases of murder – a free for a free, a slave for a slave, and a female for a female. But if one is pardoned by the victim’s guardian, then a fair ransom of blood money should be set and paid in the best way. This is a concession and a mercy from your Lord. But whoever transgresses the limits afterward, will have a painful punishment. . In the legal retribution, there is [saving of] life for you, O people of understanding, so that you may become righteous.",
2,180,182,"Prescribed, made obligatory, for you, when any of you is approached by death, that is, [by] its 
causes, and leaves behind some good, material possessions, is to make testament (al-wasiyyatu is in the 
nominative because of kutiba, and is semantically connected to the particle idha, ‘when, if the latter is 
adverbial; but if this latter is conditional, then it [al-wasiyyatu] indicates the response; the response to 
the [conditional] particle in, ‘if’, is, in other words, [implied to be] fa’l-yiisi, ‘let him make teStamenf); in 
favour of his parents and kinsmen honourably, that is juStly, not giving more than the allotted share of 
a third, nor preferring the richer person — an obligation ( haqqan here emphasises the import of what 
has preceded) on those that fear, God (this verse has been abrogated by the ‘inheritance’ verse [dyat al- 
mirdth, see Q. 4:11] and by the hadith: ‘Do not make testament for one [already] inheriting’, as reported 
by al-Tirmidhl). Then if anyone, whether a witness or a trustee, changes it, that is, the testament, after hearing it, 
and knowing it, the sin, resulting from the changed testament, shall reft upon those who change it (here 
the explicit subject stands in place of the implicit one); surely God is Hearing, of the testator’s words, 
Knowing, of the deeds of the trustee, requiting [each] accordingly. But if any one fears injustice, an error, in Straying from what is right, or sin, because he has 
purposely increased the share of a third or Specified a rich individual, from one making teftament (read 
must or muwassi), and so makes things right between them, the teStator and the trustee, by commanding 
that juStice be done, then no sin shall be upon him, with regard to this matter; surely God is Forgiving, 
Merciful.","It is prescribed for you that when death approaches one of you – if he leaves behind any wealth – a bequest should be made in favor of parents and immediate family members[78] with fairness, this is a duty upon the righteous. . If someone alters the bequest[79] after hearing it, they will bear the sin of the alteration, for Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. . But if someone fears partiality or injustice from the testator, and puts things right between the parties, then there is no sin upon him, for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","[78] This ruling was abrogated in Surah an-Nisā’, stipulating obligatory shares for parents and close relatives. Those who do not inherit by law may be remembered in a bequest. . [79] i.e., the will of the deceased."
2,183,186,"O you who believe, prescribed for you, obligatory [for you], is the Faft, juft as it was prescribed 
for those, communities, that were before you so that you might guard yourselves, againSt acfts of disobe¬ 
dience, for, it [the faSt] curbs the desires that prompt these [acfts]. For days ( ayydman, ‘days’, is in the accusative as the objecft of al-siydm, ‘the faSt’, or of an implied 
yasumu, ‘he faSts’) numbered, few or Specific in number, that is, those of Ramadan, as will be mentioned 
below; God has Specified a small number as a way of facilitating matters for those under the obligation; 
and if any of you, during the month, be sick, or be on a journey, in which prayers are shortened, or if one 
is Strained by the faSt in both cases and breaks it, then a number of other days, equal to the ones during 
which he broke his faSt — let him faSt them instead; and for those who are, not, able to do it, [to faSt] 
on account of old age or chronic illness, a redemption: which is, the feeding of a poor man, with about 
the same amount one consumes in a given day, that is, one mudd 17 measure of the principal food of that 
town each day (a variant reading has [genitive] fidyatin as an explicative clause. It is also said that the [la] 
negation of the verb [yutiqunahu] is not acftually implied, because at the very beginning of Islam, they 
could choose between faSting or offering the redemption; but later on this was abrogated by fixing the 
FaSt [as an obligation], where God says, So let those of you, who are present at the month, faft it [Q. 2:185]: 
Ibn ‘Abbas said [by way of qualification] ‘Except for the pregnant one and the one breastfeeding, if they 
break their faSt out of concern for the child; in the case of these two, the verse remains valid and has not 
been abrogated’). For him who volunteers good, by offering more than the minimum amount mentioned 
for the redemption; that, volunteering, is good for him; but that you should faft ( wa-an tasumu is the 
subject) is better for you ( khayrun lakum is its predicate), than breaking the faSt and paying the redemp¬ 
tion, if you but knew, that this is better for you, then do it. These days of, the month of Ramadan, wherein the Qur’an was revealed, from the Preserved 
Tablet to the earthly heaven on the Night of Ordainment [laylat al-qadr] from Him, a guidance (hudan, 
‘a guidance’, is a circumstantial qualifier), guiding away from error, for the people, and as clear proofs, 
lucid verses, of the Guidance, the rulings that guide to truth, and, of, the Criterion, that discriminates

Tafsir al-Jalalayn 

mentioned, but it is repeated here to avoid the mistaken impression that it has been abrogated by the 
comprehensive implication of man shahida, ‘who are present’). God desires ease for you, and desires not 
hardship for you, and for this reason He has permitted you the breaking of the fait during illness or trav¬ 
el, [this ease being] the very reason He has commanded you to faft; He supplements [the previous state¬ 
ment with]: and that you fulfil (read tukmilu or tukammilu ) the number, of the failing days of Ramadan, 
and magnify God, when you have completed them, for having guided you, for having directed you to 
the principal rites of His religion, and that you might be thankfid, to God for this. A group of followers of the Prophet (s) asked him, ‘Is our Lord nearby so that we should talk 
to Him secretly, or is He far away, so that we should call out to him?’, and the following was revealed: 
And when My servants question you concerning Me — I am near, to them in My knowledge, and he 
informed them of this; I answer the call of the caller, by granting him his request, when he calls to Me; 
so let them respond to Me, My call to them to be obedient, and let them believe, [let them] persevere in 
faith, in Me that they might go aright, [that] they [might] become guided.","O you who believe, fasting[80] is prescribed upon you as it was prescribed upon those who were before you, so that you may become righteous. . [Fasting is for] a specific number of days; but if anyone of you is ill or on a journey, he should make up for those days. As for those who can only fast with hardship, compensation can be made by feeding a needy person [for each day]. But anyone who volunteers to give more, it is better for him. Yet fasting is better for you, if only you knew[81]. . Ramadān is a month in which the Qur’an was sent down[82] as a guidance for mankind and as clear signs that show the right way and distinguish between right and wrong. So whoever of you witnesses this month, should fast. But if anyone is ill or on a journey, he should make up for those days. Allah wants ease for you and does not want hardship for you, so that you may complete the prescribed number of days, and proclaim the greatness of Allah for having guided you, and so that you may be grateful. . When My slaves ask you concerning Me, I am indeed near[83]. I respond to the call of the supplicant when he calls upon Me; so they should respond to Me and believe in Me, so that they may be guided.","[80] To abstain from food, drink, and sexual relations from dawn to dusk. . [81] The provision of this verse has been abrogated by the next verse: 185, with few exceptions, i.e., very old person, or pregnant, etc. . [82] This either means that the Qur’an was sent down from the Preserved Tablet to the Lowest Heaven on the Night of Decree during the month of Ramadan, or that it was the start of the revelation to Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). . [83] Allah’s nearness means that one does not need to raise his voice or to ask for intercession in order that his prayers be answered."
2,187,187,"Permitted to you, upon the night of the Fail, is to go in to your wives, in sexual intercourse: 
this was revealed as an abrogation of its unlawfulness during the earliest phase of Islam, as well as [an 
abrogation of] the unlawfulness of eating and drinking after the night prayer; they are a veilment for 
you, and you are a veftment for them (a metaphor for their embraces or their need for one another); 
God knows that you have been betraying yourselves, by having sexual intercourse on the eve of the fall: 
this happened with ‘Umar [b. al-Khattab] and others, and they apologised to the Prophet (5), and so 
He has turned to you [relenting], before you even turned in repentance, and He has pardoned you. So 
now, when it is permitted to you, lie with them, in sexual intercourse, and seek what God has prescribed 
for you, of sexual intercourse or what it produces of offering; and eat and drink, [at any time] dur¬ 
ing the night, until the white thread is diitind, to you, from the black thread at daybreak, that is, the 
true [moment of daybreak], which explains the white thread, while the explanation of the black thread, 
namely, the night, has been left out. The whiteness and the darkness of the dawn [twilight] are likened 
to two black and white threads in the way they stretch out; then complete the fail, from daybreak, to the 
night, that is, until it arrives, after the setting of the sun; and do not lie with them, your women, while 
you cleave to the mosques in devotion [to God], while you are residing [therein] with the intention of 
[performing] i‘tikaf (‘ffiritual retreat’). This was a prohibition pertaining to one who used to leave [the 
mosque], whilst in a ftate of i'tikaf have sexual intercourse with his wife, and then return. Those, rulings 
mentioned, are God’s bounds, delimited by God for His servants so that they do not overstep them; do 
not approach them (la taqrabuhd, is more intense than Id tatadduha, ‘Do not overstep’, used in verses 
elsewhere). So, juft as He makes clear to you what has been mentioned, God makes clear His signs to 
people so that they might fear [disobeying] His prohibitions.","It has been made permissible for you to be intimate with your wives on the nights of the fast. They are a garment for you just as you are a garment for them. Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He accepted your repentance and pardoned you. So now you may have intimacy with them[84] and seek what Allah has destined for you. And eat and drink until you see the light of dawn distinct from the darkness of night, then complete the fast until nightfall. However, should you be in a devotional retreat in the mosques then do not be intimate with them. These are the limits set by Allah, so do not even come near to them. This is how Allah makes His verses clear to people, so that they may become righteous.","[84] Prior to this revelation, marital relations were unlawful during nights preceding fasting. Some were unable to refrain and secretly disobeyed, but Allah accepted their repentance, and then it was made lawful."
2,188,188,"Consume not your goods between you, that is to say, do not let one consume the goods of the 
other, in deception, that which is illicit according to the Law, such as theft and extortion; and, do not, 
proffer them, the regulation of these [goods] or any bribes, to the judges, that you may consume, as a 
result of any arbitration, a portion of other people’s goods, embroiled, in sin while you are aware, that 
you are in error.","Do not consume one another’s property unjustly, nor entice the rulers[85] in order to consume a portion of people’s property wrongfully while you know [it is sin].","[85] By offering bribes to those who rule in cases of litigation, i.e., judges."
2,189,189,"They will ask you, O Muhammad (s), about the new moons (ahilla, plural of hildl): ‘Why do they 
seem very thin, and then wax until they are full of light, and then wane again as at the firft, and are not 
always the same, in the way that the sun is?’ Say, to them: ‘They are appointed times (mawdqit is the 
plural of miqdt) for the people, for them to know the times for sowing the land, for business, for their 
women’s waiting periods, their faft and their breaking it, and the Pilgrimage’ ( wa’l-hajji and the Pilgrim¬ 
age’, is a supplement to li’l-nasi, ‘for the people’), that is to say, [appointed times] by which its season is 
known, for if they [the new moons] always looked the same, none of these things could be known. It 
is not piety to come to the houses from their backs, in [your] ftate of pilgrimage inviolability ( ihrdm ), 
when you would bore holes in them to enter them and then exit, disregarding their doors; they used to 
do this and claim that it was out of piety; but piety is to fear, God by not contravening His commands; 
so come to the houses by their doors, when in a ftate of pilgrimage inviolability, and fear God, that you 
may proffer, [that you may] triumph. 


28 


Sura al-Baqara","They ask you about the phases of the moon. Say, “They are a means for people to determine time and pilgrimage.” It is not righteousness to enter the houses from the rear [in pilgrimage][86], but righteousness is to fear Allah. So enter the houses through their doors, and fear Allah so that you may succeed.","[86] It was an Arab practice prior to Islam to enter their houses from the back after assuming ihrām for pilgrimage, considering it an act of obedience."
2,190,194,"After the Prophet (s) was prevented from [visiting] the House in the year of the battle of 
Hudaybiyya, he made a pad: with the disbelievers that he would be allowed to return the following 
year, at which time they would vacate Mecca for three days. Having prepared to depart for the Visita¬ 
tion [‘umra], [he and] the believers were concerned that Quraysh would not keep to the agreement and 
indigate fighting. The Muslims were averse to becoming engaged in fighting while in a date of pilgrim¬ 
age inviolability in the Sacred Enclosure [al-haram] and during the sacred months, and so the following 
was revealed: And fight in the way of God, to elevate His religion, with those who fight againft you, the 
disbelievers, hut aggress not, againd them by initiating the fighting; God loves not the aggressors, the 
ones that overdep the bounds which God has set for them: this dipulation was abrogated by the verse of 
barn a, ‘immunity’ [Q. 9:1], or by His saying [below]: And slay them wherever you come upon them, and expel them from where they expelled you, 
that is, from Mecca, and this was done after the Conqued of Mecca; sedition, their idolatry, is more 
grievous, more serious, than slaying, them in the Sacred Enclosure or while in a date of pilgrimage 
inviolability, the thing that you greatly feared. But fight them not by the Sacred Mosque, that is, in the 
Sacred Enclosure, until they should fight you there; then if they fight you, there, slay them, there (a vari¬ 
ant reading drops the alif in the three verbs [sc. wa-la taqtiluhum, hatta yaqtulukum, fa-in qatalukum, so 
that the sense is ‘slaying’ in all three, and not jud ‘fighting’]) — such, killing and expulsion, is the requital 
of disbelievers. But if they desifl, from unbelief and become Muslims, surely God is Forgiving, Mercifid, to 
them. Fight them till there is no sedition, no idolatry, and the religion, all worship, is for God, alone 
and none are worshipped apart from Him; then if they desift, from idolatry, do not aggress againd them. 
This is indicated by the following words, there shall be no enmity, no aggression through slaying or 
otherwise, save againft evildoers. Those that desid, however, are not evildoers and should not be shown 
any enmity. sacred month, in return, for the sacred month, therefore, jud as they fight you during it, kill 
them during it: a response to the Muslims’ consideration of the momentous nature of this matter; holy 
things (hurumat, plural of hurma, is what mud be treated as sacrosandt) demand retaliation, in kind if 
these [holy things] are violated; whoever commits aggression against you, through fighting in the Sacred 
Enclosure, or during a date of ritual purity or in the sacred months, then commit aggression again ft him 
in the manner that he committed again ft you, the [Muslim] re^onse is also referred to as ‘aggression’, 
because that is what it resembles formally; and fear God, when avenging yourselves and [by] renouncing 
aggression, and know that God is with the God-fearing, helping and assiding [them].","Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight you[87], but do not transgress[88], for Allah does not like transgressors. . And fight them wherever you find them[89], and drive them out from where they drove you out[90], for persecution[91] is far worse than fighting. But do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque unless they fight you there. However, if they fight you, then fight them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers. . But if they desist, then Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. . Fight them until there is no more persecution[92] and religion is only for Allah. But if they desist, let there be no aggression except against the oppressors. . [Battle in] a sacred month[93] is for [aggression committed in] a sacred month, and violations are subject to retribution. So if anyone commits aggression against you, return the aggression against him in the same manner as he showed against you. But fear Allah, and know that Allah is with those who fear Him.","[87] This verse is the first one that was revealed in connection with Jihad.
 [88] Do not overlook the rulings prescribed for fighting, such as: not killing or harming women, children, the elderly, and those who did not aid the fight against you. . [89] i.e., the disbelievers who raised arms against you. [90] i.e., the land of Makkah from which the Muslims were expelled. [91] Among the meanings of ""fitnah"" are: disbelief and its imposition on others, dissension, trial, and torment. . [92] Or disbelief, polytheism, prevention from the way of Allah, etc. . [93] The sacred months: Dhul-Qi‘dah, Dhul-Hijjah, Muharram, and Rajab."

your own hands, yourselves (the ba of bi-aydikum ‘with your hands’ is extra) into deflrudion, by with¬

grimage inviolability, until the offering, mentioned, reaches its place, its place of sacrifice, that is, within 
the enclosure, according to al-Shafi‘1; the sacrifice is then made with the intention of releasing oneself 
from the date of pilgrimage inviolability, and is divided among the needy, after which the head is shaved 
and the release is effected. If any of you is sick, or has an ailment of the head, such as lice or severe pains, 
and has thus shaved his head while in a date of pilgrimage inviolability, then, incumbent upon him is, a 
redemption byfaft, for three days, or a voluntary almsgiving, considing of three cubic measures of the 
principal food of the town for six needy persons, or a ritual sacrifice, that is, the slaughter of a sheep {aw,

or without. When yon are secure, knowing that the enemy has gone or is not present, then whoever en¬ 
joys the Visitation, having completed it and observed its ritual prohibitions, until the Pilgrimage, until 
he enters its ritual inviolability in the relevant months; let his offering be such as is feasible, for him, such 
as a sheep that he sacrifices after entering into the State of pilgrimage inviolability, ideally, on the Day 
of Sacrifice; or if he finds none, because there are none available, or because he does not have sufficient 
funds, then, incumbent upon him is, a fail of three days in the Pilgrimage, that is to say, in a state of 
pilgrimage inviolability. In such a case, he should enter into the s'tate of pilgrimage inviolability before 
the seventh of Dhu’l-Hijja, but ideally before the sixth, because one is discouraged from fasting on the 
Day of‘Arafa. Moreover, he should not fait during these the days of tashriq,'"" according to the sounder 
of two opinions attributed to al-Shafi'J. And of seven when you return, to your domicile, [be it] Mecca 
or any other; or when you have completed the rites of the Pilgrimage’ (there is a shift from the third [to 
the second] person); that is afidl ten (this sentence reaffirms what has juSt been said); that, mentioned 
stipulation regarding the incumbency of the offering or the fast upon the person that has enjoyed [the 
Visitation], is for him whose family are not present at the Sacred Mosque, so that they are not within 
50 miles 19 of the Sacred Enclosure, according to al-Shafi'i. If they are [present however], then no blood 
[sacrifice] or fas't is obligatory in his case, even if he has enjoyed [the Visitation]. The mention of‘family’ 
is intended as a notification of the proviso in the case of being ‘domiciled’ [in the vicinity of the Sacred 
Mosque]. If one were to take up [temporary] residence, but not be domiciled, before the months of the 
Pilgrimage and enjoy the Visitation, then that [faSt or sacrifice] will be incumbent upon him; this is one 
of two opinions of al-Shafi‘i, the other being that it is not [incumbent]. The term ahl, ‘family’, is said to 
denote ‘oneself’. In the Sunna, in addition to the one that enjoys the Visitation, as mentioned, there is also 
the one that enters into the state of pilgrimage inviolability for both the Visitation and the Pilgrimage 
together [sc. qarin, ‘one who combines’] or in the case where the Pilgrimage encroaches upon [a Visita¬ 
tion], but before circumambulation [has been performed]. And fear God, in what He commands you 
and prohibits you; and know that God is severe in retribution, against whoever opposes Him. T/ic Pilgrimage, the time for it, is in months well-known: Shawwal, Dhu’l-Qa’da and ten nights, 
some say all, of Dhu’l Hijja; whoever undertakes, upon himself, the duty of Pilgrimage during them, by 
entering into the State of pilgrimage inviolability, then no lewdness, [no] sexual intercourse for them, nor 
wickedness, [nor] acfts of disobedience, or disputing, [or] quarrelling, in the Pilgrimage (a variant read¬ 
ing [for fa-la rafathun wa-ld fusuqun wa-ld jidala] has the accusative for all three nouns [sc. fa-la rafatha 
wa-ld fusuqa wa-ld jidala]; prohibition is meant in all three cases). Whatever good you do, byway of 
voluntary almsgiving, God knows it, and will reward you for it. And take provision, to suffice you your 
journey: this was revealed regarding the people of Yemen, who use to make the Pilgrimage and not take 
any provisions with them, thus, becoming a burden for others. But the beft provision is piety [taqwd, 
‘piety’, literally ‘guarding’] with which you are able to guard against asking others [for things]; and fear 
you Me, O people of pith!, [O] possessors ofintellecft. You would not be atfaidt if you should seek bounty, sustenance, from your Lord, by engaging 
in commerce at the Pilgrimage: this was revealed in reSJaonse to their aversion to such an idea; but when 
you press on, push on, from c Arafat, having Stood [in prayer] upon it, then remember God, after the 
overnight Stay at Muzdalifa, by repeating the talbiya [sc. labbayka Llahummd labbayk, ‘at thy service, 
O God, at thy service’], the tahlil [la ildha ilia Lldh, ‘no god but God’] and making supplications, at the 
Sacred Waymark, a mountain at the end of Muzdalifa, called Quzah. In one hadith, the Prophet (s) Stood 
there remembering God and supplicating until his face began to glow brightly, according to Muslim; and 
remember Him as He has guided you, to the principal rites of His religion and the rituals of His Pilgrim¬ 
age (the kafoi ka-ma, ‘as’, is the particle denoting the reason), though previously, before His guidance,

on the morning of the 10 th of Dhu’l-Hijja. The reference to ‘meat-drying’ is doubtful, and it is more likely to be a survival from the

you were aftray. Then (thumma denotes the sequence intended) press on, O Quraysh, from where the people 
press on, that is, from ‘Arafa, by standing there together with them (for, they used to stand at Muzdalifa, 
disdaining to ft and with other people); and seek God’s forgiveness, for your sins; God is Forgiving, Mer¬ 
ciful, to the believers. And when you have performed, and completed, your holy rites, that is, the devotions pertaining 
to your pilgrimage, having caft [Atones] at the Jamrat al-'Aqaba, 20 performed the circumambulation and 
stopped at Mina, remember God, by extolling Him and repeating the takbir [saying Allahu akbar, ‘God is 
Great’], as you remember your fathers, as you used to remember them and bo a,'it about them at the end 
of your pilgrimage, or yet more intensely, than your remembrance of them ( ashadda is in the accusative 
because it is a circumstantial qualifier referring to dhikr ‘remembrance’, which itself is in the accusative as 
the objecft of udhkuru, ‘remember’, because had it come after it, it would have functioned as an adjecftival 
phrase). There are some people who say, ‘Our Lord, give to us, our lot, in this world’, and they are given 
it; such people will have no part, no lot, in the Hereafter. And there are others who say, ‘Our Lord, give to us in this world good, a grace, and good, Para¬ 
dise, in the Hereafter, and guard us again ft the chaftisement of the Fire’, by not making us enter it. This 
[former Statement] depicfts the manner of the idolaters, while [the latter] the way of the believers, and is 
intended to encourage [people] to petition for good in both abodes, for which one is promised a reward, 
as He says: Those — they shall have a portion, a reward, from, as a result of, what they have earned, the 
deeds they have performed, such as Pilgrimage and supplication; and God is swift at reckoning, reckon¬ 
ing with the whole of creation in half a day of this world, as one hadith States. And remember God, by making takbir [saying Allahu akbar, ‘God is Great’] while you caSt your 
Stones at the Jamarat, during certain days numbered, the three days of tashriq 21 . If any man haftens on, 
his departure from Mina, in two days, that is, on the second day of tashriq after he has caSt his Stones, 
that, hastening, is no sin for him; and if he delays, such that he Stays until the third night and caSt his 
Stones, it is not a sin for him: that is, they have the choice of either, for the sin has been precluded in both 
cases; if he fears, God during his pilgrimage — for such [a person] is truly a pilgrim — and fear God, 
and know that to Him you shall be gathered, in the Hereafter, that He may requite you for your deeds.","And Complete Hajj and ‘Umrah for Allah. But if you are prevented, then [offer] whatever sacrificial animal is available, and do not shave your heads until the sacrificial animal reaches its place of sacrifice. But if anyone among you is sick or has an ailment of the scalp [and had his head shaved], then he must compensate by fasting, charity, or a sacrificial offering[96]. And when you are safe, then if anyone takes a break between ‘Umrah and Hajj, he must offer a sacrifice of whatever animal is available. However, if he cannot afford an offering, he should fast for three days during Hajj and seven days upon his return [home], making ten days in all. This is for those who are not residents of the Sacred Mosque. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is severe in retribution. . The pilgrimage is in known months[97]. Whoever commits himself to perform the pilgrimage, there should be no intimacy, foul language, and arguments during the pilgrimage. Whatever good you do, Allah is aware of it. And take provisions for the journey, but the best provision is righteousness. So fear Me, O people of understanding. . There is no blame upon you for seeking the bounty of your Lord [by trading]. But as you leave the plains of ‘Arafāt, remember Allah at the Sacred Site [in Muzdalifah] and remember Him for having guided you, for you were previously among those who had gone astray. . Then move on from where the people move on[98], and seek Allah’s forgiveness, for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. . When you have completed your rites, remember Allah as you used to remember your forefathers[99], or even with greater remembrance. There are some people who say, “Our Lord, give us in this world,” but they will have no share in the Hereafter. . And there are others[100] who say, “Our Lord, give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and protect us from the punishment of the Fire.” . They[101] will receive their share of what they have earned. And Allah is swift in reckoning. . And remember Allah during the appointed days[102]. But whoever hastens to depart [Mina] on the second day, there is no sin upon him; and whoever delays [until the third], there is no sin upon him for those who fear Allah. So fear Allah, and know that you will be gathered before Him.","[96] Fasting three days, feeding six poor of Haram (sanctified area of Makkah), or slaughtering a sheep or goat and distributing it among the poor of Haram. .

[98] The addressees are the Quraysh, who held back from going to ‘Arafāt and instead remained in Muzdalifah, considering themselves above others. . [99] The Arabs were very fond of talking without end about the chivalric and heroic deeds of their ancestors. . [100] These are the ones who are well-guided. . [101] Those who supplicate with this prayer. . [102] These are the three days of staying at Mina during Hajj: 11th, 12th and 13th of Dhul-Hijjah."

please you in the Hereafter because it contradicts what he actually used to believe; and who calls on God 
to witness what is in his heart, as being in accordance with what he says; yet he is moft ftubborn in dis¬ 
pute, with you and your followers on account of his enmity towards you: this was al-Akhnas b. Sharlq, 22 
a hypocrite who SJioke kindly in the presence of the Prophet (s), swearing that he believed in him and 
that he loved him, and frequently sitting with him. God then revealed his mendacity in this matter. On 
one occasion he passed by some crops and livestock that belonged to the Muslims and later that night he 
set hre to them [the crops] and slaughtered them [the livestock]. God, moreover, says: And when he turns his back, leaving you behind, he haftens, he walks, about the earth to do 
corruption there and to deftroy the tillage and the flock (these [laft two actions] are included in such 
corruption); and God loves not corruption, that is to say, it does not please Him.

22 Al-Akhnas, or Ubayy, b. Shariq b. ‘Amr, Abu Tha'laba al-Thaqafi was a confederate of the Banu Zuhra during the Battle of 
Badr. He received his nickname ( akhnas , lit. ‘to withdraw’ or ‘to sneak away’) from the fact that he advised the Banu Zuhra to 
withdraw back to Mecca after learning that Abu Sufyan, in charge of a caravan belonging to the Band Zuhra, had managed to elude 
the Prophet’s troops. After Mecca fell to the Prophet, he was among those who were converted and received a share of the alms, 
those referred to in Q. 9:60, whose hearts were to be reconciled ( al-mu’allafatu qulubihim ) to Islam. Al-Akhnas died early on in

age by the Byzantines; he fought at Badr with the Prophet, and died in Medina; in Muslim tradition he represents the Byzantine 
counterpart to Salman al-Farisi, the earliest non-Arab converts to Islam; see al-Dhahabi, Siyar, 11, 17-26. 

24 Bilal b. Rabah (d. betw. 17 and 21/638 and 642) was a Companion of the Prophet, but most famously, he was the Prophet’s 
muadhdhin, making the customary call to prayer. He was of African, possibly Ethiopian, Sock born in slavery at Mecca and one of 
the earliest converts. He was manumitted by Abu Bakr, and fought at Badr, where he killed his former master. He officially became 
mu’adhdhin in the first year of the Hijra, but the climax of his career came when he made the call to prayer from the roof top of 
the Ka'ba, after Mecca fell to the Muslims. After Abu Bakr’s death, he sjrent the rest of his days in Syria; see Walld ‘Arafat, s.v. ‘Bilal

the believers, and warners, of the Fire for the disbelievers; and He revealed with them the Scripture, 
meaning, the Books, with the truth (bi’l-haqqi, ‘with the truth’ is semantically connected to anzala, ‘He 
revealed’) that He might decide, according to it, between people regarding their differences, in religion; 
and only those who had been given it, the Scripture, so that some believed while others disbelieved, 
differed about it, [about] religion, after the clear proofs, the manifest arguments for God’s Oneness, 
had come to them ( min [of min badi, ‘after’] is semantically connected to ikhtalafa, ‘they differed’, and 
together with what follows should be understood as coming before the exception [ilia lladhina, ‘only 
those’]); out of insolence, on the part of the disbelievers, one to another; then God guided those who be¬ 
lieved to the truth, regarding which (min [of min al-haqqi, ‘of the truth’] here is explicative) they were at 
variance, by His leave, by His will; and God guides, with His guidance, whomever He will to a straight 
path, the path of truth. The following was revealed after the Muslims suffered a trying experience: Or did you suppose 
that you should enter Paradise without there having come upon you the like of, what came upon, those, 
believers, who passed away before you?, of trials, so that you may endure as they did; a new sentence 
begins here, explaining the previous one: They were afflicted by misery, extreme poverty, and hardship, 
illness, and were so convulsed, by all types of tribulations, that the Messenger and those who believed 
with him said (read yaqula or yaqulu), not expecting to see any help, on account of the extreme hardship 
afflicfting them, ‘When will God’s help come?’, [the help] which we were promised; and God responded 
to them: Ah, but surely God’s help is nigh, in coming.","Mankind was just one nation. Then Allah sent prophets with glad tidings and warnings[107], and sent down to them the Scriptures in truth, to judge between people in matters over which they disputed. But none disputed thereafter except out of arrogance after they had received the clear proofs[108]. Then Allah, by His grace, guided those who believed to the truth in which they disputed. For Allah guides whom He wills to a straight path. . Do you think that you will enter Paradise without being tested like those before you who were tested? They were afflicted with poverty and adversity and were shaken[109] until the messenger[110] and the believers with him said, “When will the help of Allah come?” Indeed, the victory of Allah is near.","[107] Ibn ‘Abbās (رضي الله عنهما) reported: “The time between Adam and Noah was ten centuries. People were on the right path, but then they started disputing over matters of faith. So, Allah sent prophets bearing glad tiding and warning”. ­[Al-Mustadrak of Al-Hākim].
 [108] The plight of humans, especially those who lack sincerity and humbleness, is such that the more knowledge they possess, the more haughty and disputatious they become. . [109] The road to Paradise is not paved with roses; it can only be reached through hardship.

2,215,215,"They will ask you, O Muhammad (s), about what they should expend. This was the question 
posed by ‘Amr b. al-Jamuh. 26 He was a wealthy elderly man and went to ask the Prophet (s) what and 
for whom he should expend; Say, to them: ‘Whatever you expend of good (min khayrin, ‘of good’, is an 
explication of ma, ‘whatever’, covering small and large amounts, and denotes one half of the question 
represented by the expender; God responds with regard to the one receiving the expenditure, this per¬ 
taining to the other half of the question, in the following) it is for parents and kinsmen, orphans, the 
needy, and the traveller, that is, they are the most deserving of it; and whatever good you may do, by 
way of expending or otherwise, God has knowledge of it’, and will requite it accordingly.","They ask you what they should spend. Say, “Whatever good you spend should be for parents, relatives, orphans and the needy, and the wayfarer; and whatever good you do, Allah is All-Knowing of it.”",
2,216,218,"Prescribed for you, obligatory [for you], is fighting, disbelievers, though it be hateful to you, by 
nature, because of the hardship involved. Yet it may happen that you hate a thing which is good for you; 
and it may happen that you love a thing which is bad for you: because the soul inclines towards those 
desires which result in its destruction and its rejection of the religious obligations that would bring about 
its happiness. Perhaps, then, even if you are averse to it, you will find much good in fighting, as a result of 
victory, booty, martyrdom or reward; while, if you were to reject fighting, even if you would like to do so, 
you will find much evil, because then you may be subjugated, impoverished and denied the reward; God 
knows, what is good for you, and you know, this, not, so Strive in what He commands you. Thus the Prophet (s) sent forth the firSt of his raiding parties under the command of‘Abd Allah

Islam from among the Ansar. Some reports Sate that he fought alongside the Prophet at al 'Aqaba and Badr, but lost his life at the 
battle of Uhud, in year 3/624. Although he did lose his life at Uhud along with one of his sons, some reports suggest that he had 
been prevented from joining the fight at Badr by his sons, on account of his old age and a lameness. He joined his sons at Uhud 
only after personally pleading with the Prophet to allow him to join the ranks of the Muslims. Despite the Qur’anic dispensation 
that he, on account of his old age and lameness, was exempt from partaking in the fighting, the Prophet relented when he saw the 
old mans eagerness for martyrdom; see Ibn al-Athir, Usd, iv, 294-96.

month of] Rajab, thinking that it was the la^t day of Jumada II. 27 The disbelievers reviled them for mak¬ 
ing fighting lawful in a sacred month, and so God revealed the following: They ask you about the sacred, 
the forbidden, month, and fighting in it (qitdlin fihi, ‘fighting in it’, is an inclusive substitution [for al- 
shahri l-harami, ‘the sacred month’]). Say, to them: ‘Fighting (qitdlun is the subjecft) in it is a grave thing 
(kabir, ‘grave’, is the predicate), that is, heinous in terms of sin; but to bar ( saddun is the subjecft), people, 
from God’s way. His religion, and disbelief in Him, in God, and, to bar from, the Sacred Mosque, that 
is, Mecca, and to expel its people, the Prophet (s) and the believers, from it — that is graver (the predi¬ 
cate of the [laSt] subjecft), [that is] more heinous in terms of sin than fighting in it, in God’s sight; and 
sedition, your idolatry, is graver than, your, slaying’, in it. They, the disbelievers, will not cease to fight 
againd you, O believers, until, so that, they turn you from your religion, to unbelief, if they are able; 
and whoever of you turns from his religion, and dies disbelieving — their, good, works have failed, that 
is, they are invalid, in this world and the Hereafter. Thus they will not count for anything and will not 
result in any reward. The Specification of death as a condition is because if that person were to return 
to Islam [again], his original deeds would not be invalidated, and he will be rewarded for them, and he 
would not have to repeat them, [deeds] such as [performing] the Pilgrimage: al-ShafiT is of this opinion. 
Those are the inhabitants of the Fire, abiding therein. When those of the raiding party [of ‘Abd Allah b. Jahsh] thought that, although they had been 
released from the sin [of having slain in the sacred month], they would not receive any reward, the fol¬ 
lowing was revealed: Verily the believers, and those who emigrate, and depart from their homeland, 
and Struggle in God’s way, in order to elevate His religion — those have hope of God’s compassion. His 
reward; and God is Forgiving, of believers, Mercifid, to them.","Fighting has been enjoined upon you, even though you dislike it. But it maybe that you dislike something which is good for you, and you like something which is bad for you. Allah knows and you do not know. . They ask you about fighting in the Sacred Months[111]. Say, “Fighting therein is a great sin, but preventing people from the path of Allah, disbelieving in Him, preventing from the Sacred Mosque, and expelling its people from it is a greater sin with Allah, and persecution is far worse than fighting[112].” They will not cease fighting you until they turn you away from your faith if they can. And if anyone among you renounces his faith and dies as a disbeliever, their deeds will be void in this life and in the Hereafter. They are the people of the Fire; they will abide therein forever. . Those who believed, migrated, and fought for the sake of Allah – it is they who hope for Allah’s mercy, and Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","[111] Sacred Months are: 1st, 7th, 11th and 12th months of the lunar calendar. [112] The disbelievers asked this to scorn the Prophet (ﷺ) for what they saw as breaking an oath when a group of believers unknowingly killed a disbeliever during a sacrosanct month. [An-Nasā’ī, As-Sunan al-Kubrā]."
2,219,219,"They ask you about wine, and divinatory arrows, gambling, and what the ruling is regarding 
them. Say, to them: ‘In both, that is, in the partaking of both, is great sin (a variant reading [for kabir, 
‘great’] has kathir, ‘much’) because of the fighting, cursing and swearing that ensue from it; and profit 
for men, by way of delight and enjoyment in wine, and acquiring money effortlessly from gambling; but 
the sin in them, that is, the degenerate behaviour in which they result, is greater, graver, than the use¬ 
fulness’. When this verse was revealed, some gave up drinking, while others persisted, until the verse of 
surat al-Maida [Q. 5:90-91] finally made it illicit. And they will ask you what, that is to say, how much, 
they should expend. Say, expend, ‘Comfortably’ (al-‘afwa [in the accusative] is also read in the nomina¬ 
tive, al-’afwu, implying a preceding huwa ), that is, the surplus of your need, and do not expend what you 
need, ruining yourselves. So, just as He explained to you what has been mentioned, God makes clear His 
signs to you that you might refled,","They ask you about intoxicants and gambling. Say, “In both, there is a great sin, and some benefits for people, but their sin is far greater than their benefit[113].” They ask you what they should spend. Say, “The surplus”. This is how Allah makes His verses clear to you, so that you may contemplate –",[113] The provision of this verse concerning alcoholic drinks and gambling has been abrogated by the verse 5:90.

ask you about orphans, and the distress their affair caused them, for, if they became intimate with them,

27 Abu Muhammad, 'Abd Allah b. Jahsh b. Riyab al-Asadi was among the Muslims who fell at Uhud (3/624); he was buried along¬ 
side Hamza b. 'Abd al-Muttalib. ‘Abd Allah’s mother was Umayma bt. ‘Abd al-Muttalib, one of the Prophet’s aunts, and his sifter 
Zaynab bt. Jahsh was one of the Prophet’s wives. He is said to have participated in both Emigrations, the firSt one to Ethiopia and 
the second to Medina, and is also said to have been: the firSt amir al-mu’minin, ‘Commander of the Believers’; responsible for the 
firSt booty to have been taken by the Muslims, and the firSt to divide it according to the khums division (cf. Q. 8:41); see Ibn al- 
Athir, Usd, in, 194-96. The events described above — in which a group of Muslims attacked a Meccan caravan, killed some of its 
men and seized the booty — took place in year 2 of the Hijra, shortly before the change of the qibla from Jerusalem to Mecca, and 
two months before the battle of Badr. The episode itself is referred to as ‘the raiding party ( sariyya ) of ‘Abd Allah b. Jahsh’ both 
in Ibn Hisham’s Sira of the Prophet and in historical compilations that contain some version of the Sira. The different accounts 
seem to disagree on certain aSpedts of the incident. If the association of the above Qur’anic verse — about the prohibition of fight¬ 
ing in the sacred months — with this episode is correct, then the events muSt have occurred either side of the sacred month of 
Rajab (the 7 th month in the Muslim calendar; the other three sacred months are Muharram, Dhu’l-Qa'da and Dhu’l-Hijja); this is 
because all the versions mention the month of Rajab. The issue of the men’s confusion over the exact time of the month in which 
they embarked on the raid does not always constitute the central concern of some accounts. For example, Ibn Sa'd, in his Tabaqat, 
does not associate the raid with slaying during the sacred month, let alone any occasion for a verse revelation, but merely informs 
his reader that the said party was sent out by the Prophet in the month of Rajab (see Ibn Sa'd, Tabaqat, m.i, 62-64, sub tabaqat 
al-badriyyin min al-muhajirin). However, in Ibn al-Jawzi’s account, as in that of Ibn Hisham’s recension of the Sira, the association 
with the Qur’anic verse in question is made: the confusion is described as having been over an overlap between the sacred month 
of Rajab and either the preceding month of Jumada II or the following month of Sha'ban, neither of which was sacred with reSpedt 
to fighting (see Ibn al-jawzl, Munlazam, hi, 91-93, sub anno 2).

separately, this would distress them. Say: ‘To set their affairs aright, in terms of their funds, by looking 
after it, and your mingling with them, is better’, than you not doing this; and if you intermix with them, 
your funds and theirs, they are your brothers, in religion and it is only natural for one to intermix his 
affair with his brother, so you do too; God knows well him who works corruption, in their property when 
he intermixes with them, from him who sets, it, aright, and God will requite both; and had He willed He 
would have harassed you, and made it difficult for you by prohibiting you from intermixing with them. 
Surely God is Mighty, victorious in His affair, Wise, in His actions. O Muslims, Do not marry idolatresses, disbelievers, until they believe; a believing slavegirl is 
better than an idolatress, who may be a free woman; this was revealed as a rebuttal of the idea that it was 
shameful to marry a slavegirl and that it was better to marry an idolatress free woman; though you may 
admire her, because of her beauty and wealth: this provision excludes the womenfolk of the People of the 
Scripture (as indicated by the verse [Q. 5:5], [lawful to you] are the chafie women among those who were 
given the Scripture). And do not marry, off believing women to, idolaters, until they believe. A believing 
slave is better than an idolater, though you may admire him, for his wealth and good looks. Those, the 
people of idolatry, call to the Fire, because they invite one to perform deeds that merit this, and for this 
reason one should not marry with them; and God calls, through the voice of His prophets, to Paradise 
and pardon, that is, to the deeds that merit these two, by His leave, by His will, so that His call may be 
heeded by marrying with His friends; and He makes clear His signs to the people so that they might 
remember, [that] they [might] be admonished.","in this life and the Hereafter. They ask you about orphans. Say, “Serving their interests is best. Should you mix your affairs with theirs, then they are your brothers. Allah knows who is dishonest and who is honest. If Allah had willed, He could have made things hard for you. Allah is indeed All-Mighty, All-Wise.” . Do not marry polytheist women until they believe; for a believing slave woman is better than a free polytheist, even though she may attract you. And do not give your women in marriage to polytheist men until they believe, for a believing slave is better than a free polytheist, even though he may attract you. They invite to the Fire while Allah invites to Paradise and to forgiveness by His grace, and He makes His verses clear to people so that they may take heed[114].","[114] i.e., worship and obey Allah alone."

or in the part affeCted; and do not approach them, for sexual intercourse, until they are pure (yathurna, 
or yattahharna: the original ta [of yatatahharna] has been assimilated with the ta), that is, until they 
have cleansed themselves after its cessation; when they have cleansed themselves, then come to them, in 
sexual intercourse, as God has commanded you’, by avoiding it, the female organ, during menstruation 
and not resorting to any other part. Truly, God loves, that is, He rewards and honours, those who repent, 
of sins, and He loves those who cleanse themselves, from impurities. Your women are a tillage for you, that is, the place where you sow [the seeds of] your children; so 
come to your tillage, that is, the Specified place, the front part, as, in whichever way, you wish, whether

Jews saying that if a person had vaginal intercourse with his wife from behind, the child would be born 
cross-eyed; and offer for your souls, righteous deeds, such as saying, ‘In the Name of God’ ( bismillah) 
when you commence intercourse; and fear God, in what He commands and prohibits; and know that 
you shall meet Him, at the Resurrection, where He will requite you according to your deeds; and give 
good tidings, of Paradise, to the believers, who feared Him.","They ask you about menstruation. Say: “It is impurity; so stay away from women during menstruation[115] and do not have intercourse with them until they become pure. When they are cleansed[116], then have intimacy with them as Allah has commanded you. Allah loves those who frequently repent and He loves those who purify themselves. . Your wives are a [place of] tillage for you, so come to your tillage as you please[117], and send forth something good for yourselves. Fear Allah and know that you will meet Him, and give glad tidings to the believers.”","[115] i.e., refrain from sexual intercourse. [116] By taking a ritual bath (ghusl). . [117] Have sexual relations with your wives in any position as long as it is in the vagina."
2,224,225,"D° n °t make God, by swearing in His Name, a hindrance, a cause of impediment, in your oaths, 
that is, setting up [such impediments] by swearing in His Name frequently, so as not, to be pious and 
God-fearing; in such instances oaths are hateful, and result in perjury, which requires a redemption, 
effected by doing the opposite [of the oath], such as performing righteous deeds and so forth, which 
constitute an aCt of obedience; and to put things right between people : this means, do not be prevented 
from doing righteous deeds, as mentioned, juft because you swore againSt them; nay, do them and make 
redemption; [this understanding of the verse is] justified by the reason for its revelation, namely, their re¬ 
fraining from such deeds; surely God is All-Hearing, of what you say, Knower, of your circumstances. God will not take you to task for a slip, that results, in your oaths, which is what the tongue ut¬

God is Forgiving, of the harm they caused their women by swearing, Merciful, to them. But if they resolve upon divorce, by not repealing it, then let them go through with it; surely God 
is Hearing, of what they say; Knowing, of their resolve, meaning that after the waiting period mentioned, 
they can only revert or divorce.","For those who swear not to have intercourse with their wives is a waiting period of four months. Should they then return [to each other], then Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. . But if they are determined to divorce, then Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",

plural of qar’), of purity or menstruation — these are two different opinions — which begin from the 
moment of divorce. This [Stipulation] applies to those who have been sexually penetrated but not to 
those otherwise, on account of His saying, there shall be no [waiting] period for you to reckon againfi them 
[Q. 33:49L The waiting period for immature or menopausal women is three months; pregnant women, 
on the other hand, muSt wait until they give birth, as Stated in the surat al-Taldq [Q. 65:4], while slave- 
girls muSt wait two months, according to the Sunna. 28 And it is not lawful for them to hide what God has 
created in their wombs, of child or menstruation, if they believe in God and the Lail Day. Their mates, 
their Spouses, have a better right to restore them, to bring them back, even if they refuse, in such time, 
that is, during the waiting period, if they desire to set things right, between them, and put pressure on 
the woman [to return]; the Statement is not a condition for the possibility of return, but an incitement 
[to set things right] in the case of repealed divorce; the term ahaqq, ‘better right to’, does not denote any 
priority, since, in any case, no other person has the right to marry them during their waiting period; 
women shall have rights, due from their Spouses, similar to those, rights, due from them, with justice, as 
Stipulated by the Law, in the way of kind conjugality and not being harmed; but their men have a degree 
above them, in rights, as in their duty to obey their husbands, because of their [the husbands’] payment 
of a dowry and their [husbands] being the bread-winners; God is Mighty, in His Kingdom, Wise, in what 
He has ordained for His creatures. Divorce, that is, repudiation of the type that may be revoked, is twice; then honourable reten¬ 
tion, that is to say, you are then obliged to revert to them to retain them, without harming them; or set¬ 
ting, them ,free kindly. It is not lawfid for you, O male Spouses, to take of what you have given them, of 
dowry, if you divorce them, unless the, married, couple fear that they may not maintain God’s bounds, 
that is to say, that they will not honour the rights God has established for them (a variant reading [for 
yakhafd, ‘they (dual form) fear’] has yukhdfd, with the diredt objecft taking the accusative ending; alia 
yuqimd is an inclusive substitution for the person [governing the verb]; both verbs are also read in the 
second person [sc. takhdfd, ‘you fear’, tuqima, ‘you maintain’]). If you fear they may not maintain God’s 
bounds, neither of them would be at fault if she were to ransom herself, of some money, so that he 
should divorce her. In other words, in this instance, there is no culpability either for the man, should he 
take of the dowry, or for the woman, should she offer of it. Those, prescriptions mentioned, are God’s 
bounds; do not transgress them. Whoever transgresses God’s bounds — those are the evildoers. If he, the husband, divorces her, after the two utterances [of divorce]; she shall not be lawful to 
him after that, after the third [utterance of] divorce, until she marries another husband, who has sexual 
intercourse with her, as reported by the two Shaykhs [Bukhari and Muslim] , 29 If he, the second husband, 
divorces her, then neither of them would be atfaidt, that is, the woman and her firSt husband, to return 
to each other, in wedlock, after the completion of the waiting period, if they think that they will main¬ 
tain God’s bounds. Those, matters mentioned, are God’s bounds, which He makes clear to a people who 
have knowledge, [a people who] refledt. 

28 After any dissolution of marriage in Islam there is an obligatory waiting period before the woman may remarry. This differs ac¬ 
cording to whether she is a free woman or a slavegirl. In the former’s case it is referred to as the ‘idda, in the latter’s, iSlibra. If the 
woman is pregnant, of course, the waiting period ends when she has given birth, otherwise the purpose is to verify the onset of 
menstruation in order to exclude the possibility of her being with child. Generally what applies to the free woman is halved in the 
case of the slavegirl (analogous with the punishment of zind'). There are Stipulations also, of course, for the woman who’s husband 
has died or for the woman who does not menstruate, but again these differ according to whether she is a free woman or a slavegirl; 
see Schacht, Introduction, 166.

Sura al-Baqara","Divorced women should wait for three menstrual cycles[118]. It is not permissible for them to hide what Allah has created in their wombs[119] if they believe in Allah and the Last Day. Their husbands have the greater right to take them back within that period[120] if they want reconciliation. Women have rights similar to the rights over them in a reasonable manner, although men have a higher degree [of responsibility] over them. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. . Divorce may be pronounced twice; then either retaining in all kindness, or separating in the best way. It is not lawful for you to take back anything that you have given them [of dowry], except when they both fear that they would not be able to maintain the limits ordained by Allah. So if you fear that they would not be able to maintain the limits set by Allah, then there is no sin upon either of them if she opts to give something for her release[121]. These are the limits ordained by Allah, so do not exceed them; whosoever exceeds the limits ordained by Allah, it is they who are the wrongdoers. . Thereafter, if he divorces her [the third time], it is not lawful for him to remarry her until she marries another man[122]. Should he divorce her, then there is no sin on them to return to each other[123], provided that they would maintain the limits ordained by Allah. These are the limits ordained by Allah, which He makes clear to people who understand.","[118] Either menstrual periods or periods of purity between menstruation; to ensure that no pregnancy has taken place.

[122] With the intention of permanence, not merely in order to return to the previous husband.
 [123] Going back to her earlier husband if the divorce from her subsequent husband is sealed."
2,231,232,"When you divorce women, and they have, very nearly, reached, the end of, their term, then re¬ 
tain them, by returning to them, honourably, not harming them, or set them free honourably, or leave 
them until their term is completed; do not retain them, when reverting, in harm (diraran is an objecft de¬ 
noting reason), to transgress, that is, so as to force them to redemption, or to repudiate them or confine 
them indoors for a long time; whoever does that has wronged his soul, by exposing it to God’s chastise¬ 
ment; take not God’s verses in mockery, in jest by contravening them, and remember God’s grace upon 
you, that is, Islam, and the Book, the Qur’an, and the wisdom, the rulings contained therein, He has 
revealed to you, to exhort you therewith, so that you should give thanks by acting in accordance with it; 
and fear God, and know that God has knowledge of all things, and nothing can be hidden from Him. When you divorce women, and they have reached, completed, their term, of waiting, do not 
debar them — addressing the guardians here — from marrying their, divorced, husbands when they, 
the male Spouses and their women, have agreed together honourably, in accordance with the Law. The 
occasion for the revelation [of this verse] was: Ma'qil b. Yasar’s siSter was divorced by her husband, who 
then wanted to restore her, but Ma'qil refused, as reported by al-Hakim. 30 That, the prohibition against 
debarring, is an admonition for whoever of you believe in God and the Laft Day, because it is for the 
benefit of such a person; that, refraining from debarring, is purer for you, better, and cleaner, for you 
and for them, bearing in mind the suspicion that can be aroused by the couple on account of prior inti¬ 
macy. God knows, what is in your interest, and you know not, any of this, so follow His commands.","When you divorce women and they have completed their waiting period, either retain them with fairness or release them with fairness. Do not retain them in order to harm them[124], exceeding the limits. Whoever does this, he has wronged himself. Do not make mockery of Allah’s verses, and remember Allah’s grace upon you and what He has sent down to you of the Book and the Wisdom, to exhort you. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is All-Knowing of everything. . When you divorce women, and they have reached the end of their waiting period, do not prevent them from marrying their husbands[125] if they mutually agree with fairness. This advice is for all among you who believe in Allah and the Last Day. This is better and purer for you. And Allah knows, and you do not know.","[124] By prolonging an agonizing waiting period, holding them back from marrying other husbands or forcing them into seeking separation. .

the parents) desire to seek nursing, from other than the mothers, for your children, you would not be 
at fault, in this reSJjecft, provided you hand over, to them, what you have given, what you intend to give 
them in the way of wages, honourably, in kindness and good nature; and fear God, and know that God 
sees what you do, and that nothing of it can be hidden from Him.","Mothers[126] may breastfeed their children for two full years, for those who wish to complete the full term of breastfeeding. It is the obligation upon the father of the child that he provides food and clothing [for the mothers] with fairness. No soul is obligated beyond what it can bear. Neither mother nor father should be made to suffer on account of their child, and the same duty is incumbent on the heir. If they both decide on weaning, by mutual consent and consultation, there is no sin on them. And If you wish to provide a wet nurse to your children, there is no sin on you, if you pay in full what you have agreed upon with fairness. But fear Allah and know that Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.",[126] ‘Mothers’ here means divorced mothers.
2,234,237,"And those of you who pass away, die, leaving, behind, wives, they shall wait by themselves, after 
their death, refraining from marriage, for four months and ten, nights: this applies to women who are 
not pregnant. The waiting period in the case of pregnant women is for them to give birth — as Stated by 
a verse in surat al-Taldq [Q. 65:4]. The slavegirl muSt wait for half this period [of four months] accord¬ 
ing to the Sunna; when they have reached, completed, their term, of waiting, then you would not be at 
fault, O guardians, regarding what they may do with themselves, in the way of adorning themselves and 
offering themselves before suitors, honourably, in accordance with the Law; God is aware of what you 
do, both secretly and openly. You would not be at fault regarding the proposal, with the intention of marriage, you present, 
offer, or hide in your hearts, during the waiting period, to women, whose Spouses have died: such as 
men saying, ‘How beautiful you are!’, or, ‘Who could find one like you?’, or ‘How many a man muSt 
desire you!’. God knows that you will be mindful of them, in proposing to them impatiently, and so He 
has permitted you to make such offers; but do not make arrangements, of marriage, with them secretly,

‘Abbasid period. He compiled a collection of narrations, al-MuSladmk 'ala l Sahihayn, that matched the selection criteria of the 
Sahihs of al-Bukhari and Muslim but which were left out of those collections. Cf. J. Robson, s.v. ‘al-Hakim al-Naysaburi’, E12, in,

unless you fpeak honourable words, such as are acknowledged by the Law, in other words, such as pro¬ 
posals, that which is permitted to you. And do not resolve on the knot, the consummation, of marriage 
until that which is written, the period prescribed, has reached its term, and has been completed; and 
know that God knows what is in your souls, of resolve or otherwise; so befearfid of Him, that He should 
chastise you if you have made such resolve; and know that God is Forgiving, toward him who is fearful 
of Him, Forbearing, in delaying the chastisement of the one deserving it. You would not be at fault if you divorce women while you have not touched them (tamassuhunna: 
also read tumdssuhunna), that is, [while] you have not had sexual intercourse with them, nor appointed 
any obligation, dowry,/or them (the particle md, ‘while’, relates to the verbal aCtion and is also adverbial) 
that is to say, there are no sinful consequences for divorcing them if you have not copulated with them 
or assigned them a dowry, so divorce them; yet make provision of comforts for them honourably, that 
is, in accordance with the Law (bi’l-ma’ruf, ‘honourably’, is an adjectival qualification of mataan, com¬ 
forts’), giving them what they can enjoy, the one of ample means, the affluent among you, according to 
his means, and the needy man, of restricted income, according to his means — an obligation (haqqan, 
‘obligation, is either a second qualifier of mataan, comforts’, or an emphatic verbal noun), on the virtu¬ 
ous, the obedient ones. And if you divorce them before you have touched them, and you have already appointed for 
them an obligation, then one-half of what you have appointed, muSt be given to them and the other half 
returns to you; unless it be that they, the women, make remission, and forgo it, or he makes remission, 
by leaving her the entire amount, the one in whose hand is the knot of marriage, the husband to be, or 
as Ibn ‘Abbas is reported to have said, ‘The legal guardian, where the female is a minor’; in which case 
nobody would be at fault; yet that you should remit ( wa-an tafu is the subject) is nearer to piety ( aqrabu 
li’l-taqwd is its predicate). Forget not kindness between you, that is, to be bountiful towards one another; 
surely God sees what you do, and will requite you accordingly.","Those among you who pass away and leave behind widows should refrain from remarrying for four months and ten days. When they have completed their waiting period, there is no sin on you concerning what they do for themselves[127] in a reasonable manner[128]. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do. . There is no sin on you if you hint a proposal of marriage or keep it concealed in your hearts. Allah knows that you will make mention of them[129], but do not make a secret promise with them, except that you may say something appropriate[130]. Do not resolve a marriage contract until the prescribed time is reached. And know that Allah knows what is in your hearts, so be cautious of Him and know that Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing. . There is no sin on you if you divorce women before you have consummated the marriage or the dowry has been fixed; but give them a [gift of] compensation – the wealthy according to his means and the poor according to his means – a reasonable compensation is an obligation upon those who do good. . If you divorce them before you have consummated the marriage, but you have already fixed their dowry, then pay half the amount agreed upon, unless the wife graciously waives it or the husband graciously pays it in full, but graciousness is closer to piety. Do not forget to be graceful to one another, for Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.","[127] They may remarry if they wish.

reported by Ahmad [b. Hanbal] and others; it is also said to mean ‘in silence’ [sakitin], on the basis of a 
hadith of Zayd b. Arqam, in which he said, ‘We used to SJaeak to each other sometimes during prayer, but

would not be at fault, [you] the guardians of the dead one, regarding what they may do with themselves 
honourably, in accordance with the Law, such as adorning themselves or abandoning the mourning, 
or that you should cut off their expenditure; God is Mighty, in His Kingdom, Wise, in His actions. The 
teStament mentioned here was abrogated by the ‘inheritance’ verse [Q. 4:12], and the waiting of one year 
[without expulsion] was abrogated by the previous verse four months and ten [Q. 2:234] which was re¬

Sura al-Baqara There shall be provision for divorced women, which they are given, honourably, as is feasible 
— an obligation (haqqan, ‘obligation, is in the accusative because it is governed by an implied verb) on 
those who fear God, may He be exalted. He has repeated the phrase in order to include the woman that 
has been touched [sexually], since the previous verse addresses a different issue. So, in the same way that He has explained to you what has been mentioned, God makes clear His 
signs for you, so that you might understand, refled:.","Those of you who pass away leaving widows should bequeath in their favor to be maintained for one year without forcing them out[134]. But if they leave, then there is no blame on you for what they reasonably do with themselves. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. . The divorced women must be paid reasonable compensation, an obligation upon the righteous. . This is how Allah makes His verses clear to you, so that you may understand.",[134] The provision of this verse has been abrogated by verse 4:12.
2,243,245,"Have you not seen (an interrogative to provoke amazement and a longing to hear what will fol¬ 
low), that is, ‘Has your knowledge not attained’, those thousands, four, eight, ten, thirty, forty or seventy 
thousand, who went forth from their habitations fearful of death? ( hadhara’l-mawt: an objed denoting 
reason). These were a people from among the Children of Israel who fled their homeland after it was 
afflided with plague. God said to them, ‘Die!’, and they did. Then He gave them life, after eight days or 
more, as a result of the supplication of their prophet Ezekiel ( Hizqil ), and they lived on for a while with 
the effeds of death dill upon them, such that when they wore garments these turned into shrouds for the 
deceased; and this [phenomenon] remained with their descendants. Truly God is bounteous to people, 
such as when He gave life back to those jud mentioned, but moil people, that is, disbelievers, are not 
thankfid. The purpose of mentioning the dory of these people is to encourage believers to fight [in the 
way of God], which is why the following [datement] is supplemented to it: So fight in God’s way, in order to elevate His religion, and know that God is Hearing, of your 
sayings, Knowing, of your affairs, and He will requite you accordingly. Who is he that will lend God a loan, by expending his property in the way of God, that is good, 
by expending it for the sake of God, Mighty and Majedic, out of pureness of heart, and He will multiply 
(yudaif also read yuda'if) it for him manifold?, up to ten or seven hundred times or more, as will be 
mentioned soon. God Straitens, sudenance for whomever He wills in order to try him, and enlarges, 
it in abundance for whomever He wills in order to ted him; and to Him you shall be returned, in the 
Hereafter through the Resurrection, where He will requite you for your deeds.","Have you not seen those who left their homes, while they were in thousands for fear of death? Then Allah said to them, “Die,” and then He brought them back to life[135]. For Allah is ever Gracious to people, but most people are ungrateful. . And fight in the way of Allah and know that Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. . Who is it that will lend to Allah a goodly loan[136], so He will multiply it for him manifold? It is Allah Who withholds and gives in abundance, and to Him you will be returned.","[135] In order to show them that they could not escape His Judgment and make them realize that He is capable of bringing about their worst fears, only then to give them their lives back again. . [136] i.e., spending in the cause of Allah in expectation of nothing but His reward."
2,246,246,"Have you not seen, the dory and the tale of, the council, an assembly, of the Children of Israel, 
after, the death of, Moses, when they said to a prophet of theirs, namely, Samuel, ‘Send, edablish,/or us 
a king, to unite us and to whom we can refer [matters], and we will fight, with him, in God’s way’. He, 
the prophet, said, to them: ‘Might it be that (‘ asaytum, or ‘asitum) if fighting is prescribed for you, you 
will not fight? ( alia tuqatilu is the predicate of ‘asa, ‘might it be’; the interrogative is intended to confirm 
the expectation that follows [sc. that they will not fight]). They said, ‘Why should we not fight in God’s 
way, when we have been expelled from our habitations and our children?’, as a result of these latter be¬ 
ing taken captive or killed, that which they suffered at the hands of Goliath and his men. The meaning 
is, ‘There is nothing to dop us fighting, provided the requirement [we demanded] is forthcoming’. God, 
exalted be He, says, Yet when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned their backs, from fighting in 
cowardice, except a few of them, the ones that crossed the river with Saul ( Talut ), as will be mentioned; 
and God has knowledge of the evildoers, and will requite them accordingly. The prophet then asked his 
Lord to send forth a king, and God res/onded by sending forth Saul.","Did you not see the chiefs of the Children of Israel after Moses when they said to their prophet: “Appoint for us a king so that we fight in the way of Allah.” He said: “How likely is it that if fighting was enjoined upon you that you will not fight?” They said: “How could we not fight in the way of Allah, while we have been driven out of our homes and separated from our children[137]?” However, when fighting was enjoined upon them, they turned away, except a few of them. And Allah is All-Knowing of the wrongdoers.",[137] Their women and children were taken as captives by the enemy.
2,247,248,"Then their prophet said to them, ‘Verily God has raised up Saul for you as king’ They said, ‘How 
can he be king over us when we have better right than he to kingship, since he is not of the tribe of mon- 
archs or that of prophets; he [Saul] was a tanner or a shepherd; seeing he has not been given amplitude 
of wealth?’ which he can use to edablish a kingdom. He, the prophet, said, to them, ‘God has chosen him 
over you, for kingship, and has increased him broadly, amply, in knowledge and body: at that time, he 
was the mod knowledgeable and the mod handsome of all the Children of Israel, and the mod perfect 
of character. God gives the kingship to whom He will, in the way He does, and there can be no objection; 
and God is Embracing, in His bounty, Knowing, of those who deserve it. And their prophet said to them, after they had demanded a sign of his kingship: ‘The sign of his 
kingship is that there will come to you the Ark, a ched containing the images of the prophets, which God 
sent down to Adam, and which was handed down to them [sc. the Israelites], until the Amalekites seized

it from them in battle. They used to commence fighting invoking it before their enemy and marching 
behind it, as well as experience peacefulness in its presence, as God says: therein is a Spirit of Peace, 
reassurance for your hearts, from your Lord, and a remnant of what the folk of Moses and the folk of 
Aaron left behind, which were Moses’s pair of sandals and his Staff, Aaron’s turban, a measure ( qafiz ) 
of the manna that used to come down on them, and the pieces of the broken tablets, the angels bearing 
it (tahmiluhu l-malaikatu, the circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb ya’tiyakum, 
‘there will come to’). Surely in that shall be a sign for you, of his kingship, if you are believers’. The an¬ 
gels bore it between the earth and the sky while they gazed at it, until finally they placed it before Saul. 
They then acknowledged his kingship and hastened to enliSt in the [holy] Struggle, and he chose seventy 
thousand of their young men.","Their prophet said to them: “Allah has appointed Saul as your king.” They said: “How could he be a king over us when we are more deserving of kingship than him, and he has not been given affluence in wealth?” He said: “Allah has chosen him over you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and physique. Allah gives kingship to whom He wills, and Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing.” . Their prophet further said to them: “The sign of his kingship is that the Ark will come to you – carried by the angels – having therein tranquility[138] from your Lord and remains of what the House of Moses and the House of Aaron had left. Indeed, there is a sign in this for you, if you are true believers.”","[138] i.e., was giving reassurance."
2,249,252,"And when Saul went forth with the hofts, from the Holy House [sc. Jerusalem], the heat was 
intense and so they asked him for water; he said, ‘God will try, teSt, you, in order to distinguish the obe¬ 
dient among you from the disobedient, with a river, between Jordan and Palestine, whoever drinks of 
it, of its water, is not of me, is not of my followers, and whoever tables it not, he is of me, except for him 
who scoops up with his hand’ ( ghurfa, or gharfa, ‘a scoop’), satisfying himself therewith and not taking 
more, he is also of my followers. But they drank of it, when they reached it and saw that it was abundant, 
except a few of them, who restricted themselves to a scoop: it is reported that one scoop was enough 
for each man and his horse, and they numbered over three hundred; and when he crossed it, with those 
who believed, the ones who confined themselves to the one scoop, they, the ones that drank profusely, 
said, ‘We have no power today against Goliath and his troops’, that is, [no power] to fight them, and 
they were cowardly and did not cross it. Those who thought, with certainty that, they would meet God, 
at the Resurrection, and these were the ones that crossed it, said, ‘How often ( kam, ‘how’, functions as a 
predicate, meaning kathir, ‘many’) a little company, group of men, has overcome a numerous one, by 
God’s leave, by His will; and God is with the patient’, [providing them] with help and assistance. So, when they went forth againft Goliath and his troops, facing them in military columns, they 
said, ‘Our Lord, pour out upon us patience, and make firm our feet, by Strengthening our hearts for this 
Struggle, and grant us victory over the disbelieving folk!’ And they routed, they broke, them, by the leave of God, by His will, and David, who was among 
the ranks of Saul’s army, slew Goliath; and God gave him, David, the kingship, over the Children of 
Israel, and Wisdom, prophethood after the death of Samuel and Saul, and the combination [of kingship 
and prophethood] had never come to anyone before him; and He taught him such as He willed, of the 
manufacture of mail-coats and the Speech of birds. Had God not repelled people some (badahum, ‘some’, 
substitutes for [saying] badan min al-nds, ‘some people’) by means of others the earth would have surely 
been corrupted, with idolaters defeating and slaying Muslims, and mosques being destroyed; but God is 
bounteous to all worlds, by repelling some by means of others. These, verses, are the verses of God We recite to you, O Muhammad (s), as narration, in truth, 
and assuredly you are one of the Messengers [of God], the emphasis is made here with the particle inna 
[of innaka, ‘surely you are’], with the remainder of the Statement being a rebuttal of the disbelievers’ say¬ 
ing, ‘You are no Messenger’.","When Saul set out along with the troops, he said: “Allah will test you with a river: whoever drinks from it, he is not from me, and whoever does not drink from it, he is from me, except the one who scoops a little with his hand.” But they all drank from it, except a few of them. When Saul and those who believed with him crossed the river, they said: “We do not have power against Goliath and his troops today.” But those who were certain that they will meet Allah said: “How often has a small group overcome large groups with Allah’s permission! And Allah is with those who are patient.” . When they faced Goliath and his troops in combat, they said: “Our Lord, shower us with patience, make our feet firm, and give us victory over the disbelieving people.” . Thus they defeated them by Allah’s grace, and David killed Goliath, and Allah gave him the kingdom and wisdom and taught him whatever He willed[139]. Were it not for Allah to repel some people by others, the earth would be filled with corruption, but Allah is All-Gracious to the worlds. . These are the verses of Allah that We recite to you [O Prophet] in truth, and you are truly one of the Messengers.","[139] i.e., knowledge of prophethood and kingdom, and how to make body armor."

Nimrod ( Nimrud ). When ( idh is a substitution for hajja, ‘diluted’) Abraham, in reSJronse to the other’s 
question, ‘Who is this Lord of yours to whom you are calling us?’, said: ‘My Lord is He who gives life, and 
makes to die’, the One that creates life and death in bodies; he [Nimrod] said, ‘Igive life, by Scaring, and 
make to die’, by killing. He then had two men brought before him, killed one and Scared the other. When 
Abraham realised that this man was a fool, Abraham, resorting to a more sophisticated argument, said: 
‘God brings the sun from the ead; so bring, you, it from the wed.’ Then the disbeliever was confused, 
perplexed and amazed; and God guides not the folk who do evil, disbelieving, to the art of argument.","Have you not considered the one[155] who argued with Abraham about his Lord, as Allah had given him kingship? When Abraham said, “My Lord is the One Who gives life and causes death.” He said, “I give life and cause death.” Abraham said, “It is Allah Who brings the sun from the east, so bring it from the west.” Thus the disbeliever was dumbfounded, and Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people[156].","[155] He is said to be the Biblical King Nimrod.

now that it is dead?’, challenging the power of the exalted One, so God made him die, and remain dead 
for, a hundred years, then he raised him up, brought him back to life to show him how this could be 
done; He, God, said, ‘How long have you tarried?’, been here?; he said, ‘I have tarried a day, or part of 
a day’, because he fell asleep before noon, and was made dead and then brought back to life again at sun¬ 
set, and thus he thought it was a days sleep; He said, ‘Nay; you have tarried a hundred years. Look at 
your food, the figs, and drink, the cup of juice, it has not spoiled, despite the length of time (the final ha 
of yatasannah, ‘to SJioil’, is said to belong to the original root, s-n-h; but it is also said to be silent, in which 
case the root would be s-n-y; a variant reading omits the final ha); and look at your ass, how it is, and he 
saw that it had died, and all that remained were its withered white bones. We did this so that you would 
know and, so that We would make you a sign, of [the truth of] the Resurrection, for the people. And look 
at the bones, of the ass, how We shall set them up, how We shall raise them back to life ( nunshiruha, or 
nanshiruhd, derived from the two expressions, nashara and anshara; a variant reading has nunshizuhd, 
meaning ‘How We shall move it and make it Stand’); and then clothe them with flesh’, and when he 
looked at it, he saw that [the bones] had been reconstituted and clothed with flesh, and that the Spirit 
had been breathed into it, making it bray. So, when it was made clear to him, as a result of witnessing it, 
he said, ‘I know (a variant reading for alam, ‘I know’, has [the imperative] i'larn, ‘know!’, thus making it 
a command from God), with the knowledge of direcft vision, that God has power over all things’.","Or [have you considered] the one who passed by a town in ruins with its roofs collapsed? He said: “How can Allah revive them after their death[157]?” Then Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then revived him. He said, “How long have you remained [dead]?” He said, “I have remained for a day or part of a day”. He said, “No, but you have remained for a hundred years. Look at your food and your drink; they have not changed. But look at your donkey, so that We make you a sign for people. Look at the bones, how We bring them together then cover them with flesh.” When this was made clear to him, he said: “I know that Allah is Most Capable of all things.”","[157] The previous verse demonstrated Allah’s Lordship, whereas this and the next verse show His ability to resurrect."
2,260,260,"And, mention, when Abraham said, ‘My Lord show me how You give life to the dead,’ He, God, 
exalted be He, said, to him, ‘Why, do you not believe?’, in My power to revive; God asks him this even 
though He knows of his belief in this [power], as a response to his request, and so that the ones listening 
will know the purpose [of the request]; ‘Yes, ’, I do believe, he said, ‘but, I ask You, so that my heart may 
be re-assured’, [so that it may be] at peace, through direcft vision, in addition to that [certainty] which 
is sought through logical reasoning. Said He, ‘Take four birds, and twifi them to you ( sirhunna, or 
surhunna), turn them towards you, cut them up and mix together their flesh and feathers, then set a part 
of them on every hill, in the land around you, then summon them, to you, and they will come to you in 
hafie. And know that God is Mighty, that nothing is beyond Him, Wise’, in His acftions. Abraham took 
a peacock, an eagle, a raven and a cock and did with them as has been mentioned, but kept their heads 
with him. He called them, and all the parts began to fly back together, combining until they were whole 
and returning to their heads.","And [remember] when Abraham said: “My Lord, show me how You give life to the dead.” He said: “Do you not believe?’’ He said: “I do believe, but just to reassure my heart[158].’’ Allah said: “Then take four birds and cut them into pieces, then put a piece of each of them on each mountain, then call them; they will come swiftly to you. And know that Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.’’","[158] The Prophet (ﷺ) implied by saying: “We are more likely to doubt than Ibrāhīm” [Al-Bukhārī: 4537, Muslim: 151], when he heard that people said Abraham doubted. Scholars are of the opinion that Abraham wanted to reach the highest rank of knowledge ‘concrete certitude’ (haqq al-yaqīn)."
2,261,264,"The likeness, of the quality of the expenditure, of those who expend their wealth in the way of 
God, that is, in obedience of Him, is as the likeness of a grain of corn that sprouts seven ears, in every 
ear a hundred grains: likewise what they expend will be multiplied seven hundred times; so God mul¬ 
tiplies, even more than this, for whom He will; God is Embracing, in His bounty, Knowing, those who 
deserve such multiplications. Those who expend their wealth in the way of God then do not follow up their expenditure with 
reminder of their generosity, of the one on whom they expended, for example, by saying, ‘I was good to 
him and restored his affairs’; and injury, to that person, by mentioning this to people whom he would 
prefer not to know about it; their wage, the reward for their expenditure, is with their Lord, and no fear 
shall befall them, neither shall they grieve, in the Hereafter. Honourable words, kind talk and a generous reply to the beggar, and forgiveness, towards him 
for his persistence, are better than a voluntary almsgiving followed by injury, through reproach and 
deriding him for his begging; and God is Independent, of the voluntary almsgiving of His servants, For¬ 
bearing, in His delaying the punishment of the reproachful and injurious one. Oyou who believe, annul not, the rewards of, your voluntary almsgivings with reproach and in¬ 
jury, as, in the manner of the annulment of the expenditure of, one who expends of his sub fiance to show 
off to men and believes not in God and the LafiDay: this is the hypocrite. The likeness of him is as the 
likeness of a smooth rock on which is soil, and a torrent, of intense rain, smites it, and leaves it barren, 
and smooth with nothing on it. Tltey have no power (la yaqdiruna is a resumption of the Statement about

surface of the smooth rock, after the rain has washed it away. God guides not the disbelieving folk.","The likeness of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a grain that sprouts seven ears, each ear bearing a hundred grains. And Allah gives multiple [rewards] for whom He wills. And Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing. . Those who spend their wealth for the sake of Allah, then do not follow up their charity with reminders of generosity or hurtful words; they will have their reward with their Lord, and they will have no fear, nor will they grieve. . Kind words and forgiveness are better than charity followed by hurt. And Allah is Self-Sufficient, Most Forbearing. . O you who believe, do not nullify your charities with reminders and hurtful words, like the one who spends his wealth to show off before people but does not believe in Allah or the Last Day. His likeness is that of a smooth rock upon which is dust, when it is hit by a heavy rain it is left bare[159]. They will gain no reward from their deeds[160], and Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.","[159] Soilless and bare, unable to grow plants.
 [160] Their insincere spending will have no harvest to reap in the Hereafter."
2,265,266,"But the likeness, of the expenditure, of those who expend their wealth, seeking God’s good pleas¬ 
ure, and to confirm themselves, that is, to realise the reward thereof, in contract to the hypocrites who do 
not hope for it, since they do not believe in it, is as the likeness of a garden, an orchard, upon a hill, (read 
rabwa or rubwa ) a high ground; a torrent smites it and it yields, gives forth, its produce (read ukulaha 
or uklaha), its fruits, twofold, twice the fruits of another [garden]; if no torrent smites it, then dew, (tall, 
a light drizzle) which falls on it and suffices it on account of its altitude. In other words, it grows and 
bears fruit, regardless of how much rain falls; likewise are the expenditures of those mentioned: they will 
increase with God, regardless of how much they were; and God sees what you do, and He will requite 
you for it. Would any of you wish to have a garden, an orchard, of date-palms and vines, with rivers 
flowing beneath it, for him there is in it all manner of fruit, then old age smites him, and makes him 
too weak to profit from it, and he has seed, but they are weak, young children who cannot manage it; 
then a whirlwind (isar are violent winds) with fire smites it, and it is consumed?, so that he loses what 
he is moil in need of, and now he and his children have become incapacitated, confused, without any 
resources. This is a similitude of how the expenditure of the one expending for show, or the one who 
reproaches [after having expended], vanishes and how it is of no avail when he will be moil in need of it 
in the Hereafter (the interrogative [a-yawaddu, ‘would any wish’] is intended as a denial). According to 
Ibn ‘Abbas, this is the person who performs deeds of obedience, but when Satan comes to him, he begins 
to work disobedience, until all his good deeds have been consumed. So, in the way that He has explained 
what has been mentioned, God makes clear the signs to you, so that you might refledl, and take heed.","And the likeness of those who spend their wealth, seeking the pleasure of Allah and fortifying their own souls, is that of a garden on a fertile hill[161]; if it is hit by a downpour, it yields double its harvest. And if it is not hit by a downpour, then a drizzle is sufficient. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do. . Would any of you wish to have an orchard of date palms and grapevines, under which rivers flow, full of all kinds of fruits; but he grew old and had feeble young children, then it is hit by a fiery whirlwind, burning it all[162]? This is how Allah makes the verses clear to you so that you may reflect.","[161] Gardens and farms on elevated land are more fertile than lower placed ones. This is the analogy Allah draws of the charity of the sincere. No matter how much it is, it grows and prospers. . [162] Those who follow their charity by taunting and hurting the recipient’s feelings, thus rendering their charity void. ‘Umar (رضي الله عنه) said, ""This is an example of a rich man who does good deeds out of obedience to Allah, and then Allah sends him Satan whereupon he commits sins till all his good deeds are lost.""

Laudable, praised in every situation. Satan promises you poverty, by making you fear [loss] when you make a voluntary almsgiving, 
and so you withhold it, and enjoins you to indecency, niggardliness and the impeding of almsgiving; but 
God promises you, in return for your expenditure, His pardon, for your sins, and His bounty, as suste¬

almsgiving and vows, or expend other than the way they should, in disobedience to God, they have no 
helpers, to protect them from His chastisement. If you proclaim, make manifest, your voluntary almsgivings, that is, your supererogatory deeds, 
it is a fine thing, to show them; but if you conceal them, and give them to the poor, that is even better 
for you, than making them manifest or giving it to the rich. As regards the obligatory almsgiving, it is 
better to make it manifest, so that it serves as an example and so that one is not accused [falsely of not 
giving]; as regards giving it to the poor, this is obligatory; and it will absolve you of, some of, your evil 
deeds (read yukaffir, ‘it will absolve’, or nukaffir, ‘We will absolve’, either in apocopated form [with no

2,272,274,"When the Prophet (s) was prohibited from giving voluntary alms to idolaters [as an incentive] 
for them to embrace Islam, the following was revealed: You are not responsible for guiding them, that is 
to say, for people, that they should embrace Islam, [you are responsible] only for conveying the Message 
[to them]; but God guides, with His guidance, whomever He will, to embrace Islam. And whatever good, 
property, you expend is for yourselves, since the reward is for you; for then you are expending, desiring 
only God’s Face (this clause is the predicate, denoting a prohibition), that is to say. His reward and not 
any other transient objeCt of this world, and whatever good you expend, its requital, shall be repaid to 
you in full, and you will not be wronged, you will not suffer any diminishment of it (both [of the last 
two] sentences emphasise the firSt one). For the poor (this is the predicate of the missing subject, al-sadaqat, ‘voluntary almsgiving’), who 
are constrained in the way of God, those who have confined themselves [in preparation] for the strug¬

(muhdjirun ), set apart [from the other Muslims] for the Study of the Qur’an and to take part in raids; 
and they are unable to journey ( darban, means safaran ) in the land, to engage in commerce and earn 
their living, since they are fully engaged in the Struggle; the ignorant man supposes them, on account of 
the way they behave, rich because of their abstinence, that is, their refraining from asking for things; but 
you, the one being addressed, shall know them by their mark, by the signs of their humility and exer¬ 
tion; they do not beg of men, and make urgent demands, importunately, that is to say, they do not beg 
in the firSt place, so there is no question of persistence. And whatever good you expend, surely God has 
knowledge of it, and will requite it accordingly. Those who expend their wealth night and day, secretly and openly, their wage awaits them with 
their Lord, and no fear shall befall them, neither shall they grieve.","You are not responsible for their guidance [O Prophet], but Allah guides whom He wills. Whatever wealth you spend in charity, it is for your own good – as long as you do so seeking Allah’s pleasure. And whatever wealth you spend in charity, you will be rewarded in full, and you will not be wronged. . [Charity is] for the poor who are fully occupied in the cause of Allah, unable to move about in the land [for livelihood]; the one who is unaware would think that they are rich because of their self-restraint. You will recognize them by their appearance. They do not ask people importunately. And whatever wealth you give, then Allah is All-Knowing of it. .

ness ( min al-mass, ‘from touch’, is semantically connected to yaqumuna, ‘they rise’); that, which befalls 
them, is because, of the fad that, they say, ‘Trade is like usury’, in terms of permissibility: this [State¬ 
ment] is a type of reversed simile used for intensity [sc. ‘usury is like trade’ is the expected word order]. 
God responds to them saying that: God has permitted trade, and forbidden usury. Whoever receives an 
admonition from his Lord and desists, from devouring it, he shall have his paSt gains, those made be¬ 
fore the prohibition and which cannot be reclaimed from him, and his affair, with regard to pardoning 
him, is committed to God; but whoever reverts, to devouring it, treating it like trade in terms of lawful¬ 
ness — those are the inhabitants of the Fire, abiding therein. God effaces usury, diminishing it and eliminating any blessing in it, but He augments voluntary 
almsgivings with interest, increasing them, making them grow and multiplying their reward. God loves 
not, that is to say, He will requite, any guilty, profligate devouring it, ingrate, who deems usury licit.","Those who consume usury will not stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except like those being beaten by Satan. That is because they say, “Trade is just like usury[169].” But Allah has permitted trade and forbidden usury. Whoever desists because of receiving admonition from his Lord may keep his past gains, and his case is left to Allah. But whoever returns to it, they are the people of the Fire; they will abide therein forever. . Allah destroys usury and nourishes charities, and Allah does not like any ungrateful sinner.","[169] The image given here of a person possessed by the devil staggering while standing and walking unsteadily as they are resurrected for the Day of Judgment.

their wage awaits them with their Lord, and no fear shall befall them, neither shall they grieve. O you who believe, fear God, and give up, abandon, the usury that is outstanding, if you are 
believers, true to your faith, since it is expected of the believer that he adhere to God’s command: this 
was revealed when some of the Companions, after the prohibition, wanted to reclaim some of the usury 
from before. But if you do not, do what you have been commanded, then be warned, have knowledge, of war 
from God, and His Messenger, againSt you: herein is a grave threat for them. When it was revealed, they 
said, ‘What power can we have in a war against Him!’ Yet if you repent, and forgo it, you shall have your

Sura al-Baqara And if any man, in debt, should be in difficulties, then, let him have, respite, a postponement,

difficulty, or waives his debt, God will place him under His shade, on a day when there shall be no shade 
except Gods’, as reported by Muslim. And fear a day wherein you shall be returned to God, namely, the Day of Resurrection (read the 
passive [ turjauna ] meaning, ‘you shall be returned’, or the acftive [tarjiuna] meaning ‘you shall return’), 
and every soul, on that day, shall be paid in full, the requital of, what it has earned, what it has done 
of good or evil; and they shall not be wronged, through any loss of a good deed or the incurring of an 
extra evil deed.","Those who believe, do righteous deeds, establish prayer, and give zakah, will have their reward with their Lord; and they will have no fear, nor will they grieve. . O you who believe, fear Allah and give up usury that is still due, if you are truly believers. . But if you do not do it, then beware of a declaration of war from Allah and His Messenger. However, if you repent, you may retain your capital – neither harming nor suffering harm[170]. . If the debtor is in hardship, give him respite until it is easy for him to pay back. But if you waive it as charity[171], that is better for you, if only you knew. . And fear the Day when you will be brought back to Allah. Then every soul will be rewarded in full for what it has earned, and none will be wronged.","[170] Neither harming others by receiving interest, and nor suffering harm by preserving your principal capital in full. .

33 The difference between the two readings is one of syntax and not really of meaning. If one reads it with an (as opposed to in) 
then the clause effectively ends with the words an tadilla ihdahuma, and the verse translates as ‘and two women such witnesses 
as you approve of, leSt one of the two err, in which case one will remind the other’. If the variant reading of in is adopted, then the 
clause ends with mimman tardawna mina’l-shuhada, whereupon a new conditional sentence begins: ‘If one of the two should err, 
then the other will remind her’.

of the people involved). And let not either writer or witness, the creditor and the debtor, be pressed, to 
distorting [the agreement], being prevented from testimony or dictation; nor should the creditor press 
them by charging them with what is not suitable for the testimony or the dictation; and if you do, what 
is prohibited to you, that is sinfulness, a rebellion againSt obedience, and lack of truth, in you. And fear 
God, in what He commands and prohibits. God teaches you ( wa-yuallimukumu Llahu, is an implied 
circumstantial qualifier or it denotes the beginning of a new clause), what is in your beSt interests, and 
God knows all things. And if you are upon a journey, travelling and you contract a debt, and you do not find a writer, 
then a pledge ( ruhun or rihan, plural ofrahn ) in hand, as a guarantee for you. The Sunna clarifies the 
permissibility of making pledges in towns, where writers may be forthcoming; but the Stipulation is 
made in the event of travel because in this case it is more important to have a guarantee; God’s reference 
to it being ‘in hand’ ( maqbuda ) is a condition for the pledge given to be valid, and to satisfy the pledgee 
or his representative. But if one of you, the creditor, trusts another, the debtor, over the debt and does 
not require a pledge, let him who is trusted, the debtor, deliver his truil, the debt; and let him fear God 
his Lord, when delivering it. And do not conceal the testimony, if you are summoned to give it; whoever 
conceals it, his heart is sinful: the heart is mentioned because it is the locus of the testimony, and because 
if it sins, there are other sinful consequences, and so the person will be punished as though he were a 
sinner; and God knows what you do, nothing of which can be hidden from Him.","O you who believe, when you contract a debt among yourselves for a fixed period of time, write it down, and let the scribe write it between you with fairness. The scribe whom Allah has taught should not refuse to write, so let him write, and let the debtor dictate, but he should fear Allah his Lord, and not diminish anything out of it. If the debtor is feeble-minded, weak, or unable to dictate, then let his guardian dictate fairly, and bring two witnesses from among your men; if two men are not available, then one man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses – so that if one of them forgets, the other can remind her. The witnesses should not refuse when they are summoned. Do not be reluctant to write down your debts, whether the amount is small or large, for a fixed period of time; that is more equitable in the sight of Allah, and more supportive as evidence, and more likely to prevent doubts among yourselves. However, if you are conducting a transaction on the spot between yourselves, there is no blame upon you not to write it, but take witnesses whenever you trade with one another. Neither a scribe nor a witness should suffer harm, for if you do cause them harm, it is indeed a sin on your part. So fear Allah, for it is Allah Who teaches you, and Allah is All-Knowing of everything[172]. . If you are on a journey and find no scribe, then something should be taken as collateral. But if you trust one another, then the debtor should fulfill his trust, and let him fear Allah, his Lord. Do not conceal the testimony, for anyone who conceals it has a sinful heart, and Allah is All-Knowing of what you do.","[172] This is known as Āyat ad-Dayn, the verse of debt, and it is the longest verse in the Qur’an."
2,284,286,"To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Whether you disclose, manifest, what 
is in your hearts or hide it, of evil and resolve for it, God shall take you to account for it, informing you 
of it on the Day of Resurrection. Then He will forgive whom He will, to forgive, and chastise whom He 
will, to chaStise (both verbs are apocopated [fa-yaghfir , ‘he will forgive’, wa-yuadhdhib, ‘he will chaStise’] 
if taken as the responses to the conditional, in tubdu, ‘if you proclaim’; but they may also be read with a 
final nominative inflection [yaghfiru, yuadhdhibu] in which case, it would [constitute a new clause and] 
follow on from an implicit fa-huwa, ‘then He’). And God has power over all things, including reckoning 
with you and requiting you. The Messenger, Muhammad (s) believes in, affirms the truth of, what was revealed to him from 
his Lord, namely, the Qur’an, and the believers (wa’l-muminima is a supplement to al-rasulu, ‘the Mes¬ 
senger’); each one (the tanwin of kullun Stands in place of the second noun in an annexation [sc. kullu 
wahidin ]) believes in God and His angels, and in His Books, all of them and each of them, and His mes¬ 
sengers, and they say, ‘we make no distinction between any of His messengers’, believing in some and 
disbelieving in others, in the manner of the Jews and the Christians. And they say, ‘We hear, what we 
have been enjoined to hear and accept, and obey; we ask you: Your forgiveness, our Lord; to You is the 
homecoming’, that is, the return at the Resurrection. When the previous verse was revealed, the believers 
complained of evil whisperings and it grieved them that they should be taken to account according to 
[the principle expressed in] it, and so the following was revealed: God charges no soul save to its capacity, that is, what it is capable of bearing; for it is what it has 
merited, of good and its reward, and againSt it is what it has earned, of evil and its burden: no person 
shall be requited for another’s sin or for what he has not earned, even if he was tempted to do it. Say: 
Our Lord, take us not to task, by way of chastisement, if we forget, or err, by Straying from the right 
path unknowingly — as You used to take to task those before us: God has lifted this [burden] from this 
community, as reported in hadith. The petition here, then, is a way of acknowledging God’s favour; our 
Lord, burden us not with a load, an affair which we cannot bear, such as You did lay upon those before 
us, namely, upon the Children of Israel, as for example, the killing of oneself in repentance, the paying 
of a quarter of one’s property for alms, and the severing of the impure part. Our Lord, do not burden us 
beyond what we have the power, the Strength, to bear, of obligations and trials; and pardon us, effac¬ 
ing our sins, and forgive us, and have mercy on us, with mercy added to Your forgiveness; You are our 
Patron, our MaSter and the Guardian of our affairs; so grant us assistance again St the disbelieving folk, 
by establishing definitive proof [for us] and victory over them in battle, for it is expeCted of a patron that 
he assiSt his clients againSt their enemies. In a hadith it is Stated that when this verse was revealed and the 
Prophet (s) was reciting it, after each word it was said to him, “Granted”.

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth. Whether you reveal what is within yourselves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills, for Allah is Most Capable of all things. . The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, as do the believers. All of them believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, and His messengers, [saying], “We make no distinction between any of His messengers.” And they say, “We hear and obey. Grant us Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the [final] destination.” . Allah does not burden any soul greater than it can bear. For it is what it has earned, and against it is what it has incurred. “Our Lord, do not hold us accountable if we forget or fall into error. Our Lord, do not place on us such a burden as You have placed on those before us. Our Lord, do not burden us with that which we cannot bear. Pardon us, forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are our Protector, so give us victory over the disbelieving people[173].”[174]","[173] Allah Almighty concludes this Surah by directing His servants how to supplicate Him, just as He taught them in Surah al-Fātihah how to praise Him and ask for guidance.

3,1,7,"AlifLam Mim : God knows best what He means by these [letters]. God! There is no god except Him, the Living, the Eternal. He has revealed to you, O Muhammad (s), the Book, the Qur’an, enveloped, by the truth, with 
veracity, in what it announces, confirming what was before it, of Books; and He revealed the Torah and 
the Gofpel before, that is to say, before revealing it [the Qur’an], as guidance ( hudan, a circumstantial quali¬ 
fier meaning, hadiyin, ‘guides from error’) to people, to those who followed these two [Books] (He uses 
the word anzala for the revelation of these two, and nazzala for that of the Qur’an, for the latter en¬ 
tails repetition, whereas the two Books were revealed in one instance); and He revealed the Criterion 
( al-furqan ), meaning the Scriptures that discriminate between truth and falsehood. He mentions this 
[Criterion] after He has mentioned the three Scriptures so that it encompasses all [revealed Scriptures] 
besides these. As for those who disbelieve in God’s signs, the Qur’an or any other [revelation], for them 
awaits a terrible chastisement; God is Mighty, victorious in His affair, so that nothing can prevent Him 
from effecting His promise and His threat; Lord of Retribution, with a severe punishment for those that 
disobeyed Him, the like of which none can do. Nothing, no existent thing, whatever is hidden in heaven and earth from God, on account of His 
knowledge of universals and particulars. God ^Jjecifies them [heaven and earth] because sensory percep¬ 
tion does not go beyond these. He it is Who forms you in the wombs as He will, as males or females, white, black or otherwise. 
There is no god except Him, the Mighty, in His Kingdom, the Wise, in His actions. He it is Who revealed to you the Book, wherein are verses [that are] clear, lucid in proof, forming 
the Mother Book, the original basis for rulings, and others allegorical, whose meanings are not known, 
such as the opening verses of some suras. He [God] refers to the whole [Qur’an] as: 1) ‘clear’ [ muhkam ] 
where He says [A Book] whose verses have been made clear [Q. 11:1], meaning that it contains no imper¬ 
fections; and as 2) ‘allegorical’ [mutashabih], where He says A Book consimilar [Q. 39:23], meaning that 
its parts resemble each other in terms of beauty and veracity. As for those in whose hearts is deviation, 
inclination away from truth, they follow the allegorical part, desiring sedition, among the ignorant of 
them, throwing them into specious arguments and confusion, and desiring its interpretation, its explanation,

tablished and capable, in knowledge (al-rasikhuna fil-ilm is the subjedt, the predicate of which is [what 
follows]) say, ‘We believe in it, the allegorical part, that it is from God, and we do not know its meaning; 
all, of the clear and the allegorical, is from our Lord’; yet none remembers ( yadhdhakkar, the initial ta 
[of yatadhakkar ] has been assimilated with the dhal), that is, none is admonished, but people of pith, 
possessors of intellect, who, when they see those following that [allegorical part only], also say:","Alif Lām Mīm[1]. . Allah: None has the right to be worshiped except Him, the Ever-Living, the All-Sustaining. . He has sent down to you the Book[2] in truth, confirming what came before it. And He sent down[3] the Torah and the Gospel . previously, as guidance for people, and He sent down the Criterion [between right and wrong]. But those who reject the verses of Allah will suffer severe punishment, and Allah is All-Mighty, Capable of Retribution. . Indeed, there is nothing hidden from Allah on earth or in heaven. . It is He Who shapes you in the wombs as He wills. None has the right to be worshiped except Him, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. . It is He Who has sent down to you the Book.

When she asked him the reason for this, he (ﷺ) replied, saying: “Umm Salamah, know that every human’s heart is between two Fingers of Allah.

1 There is some debate about the significance and early development of the terms ta’wil and tafsir and how they were used in Mus¬ 
lim exegesis. It seems that during the firSt three centuries of Islam there was no consistent differentiation between the two terms, 
both functioning as synonyms for ‘the explanation of the revealed text. Eventually the two terms came to denote diStinCt aspects of 
exegesis so that ta’wil represented the esoteric, while tafsir was limited to the exoteric. This distinction can be traced back to about 
the middle of the second century AH, as evidenced by a well-known tradition transmitted by the Kufan scholar Muhammad b. al- 
Kalbl (d. 146/763) in which Ibn ‘Abbas (d. 69/688) States the following, ‘The Qur’an has four aSJjeCts: tafsir, which scholars know; 
Arabic, with which the Arabs are acquainted; al-halal wa’l-hardm, the lawful and the unlawful, which all Muslims muSt know; and 
finally, ta’wil, which God alone knows’. As well as signalling a delineation between tafsir and ta’wil as technical terms, the early 
circulation of such reports also reflected the growing opposition of (Sunni) traditioniSls, the ahl al hadilh, to exegesis not based on 
reports with isnads going back to the Prophet or a Companion. Thus, exoteric commentary became the mainStay of Sunni exegesis, 
while esoteric ta’wil featured largely in Shi‘i exegetical writing, both Imami and Isma'ili, and more importantly, in Sufi commentar¬ 
ies. It is interesting to note that for the above verse [Q. 3:7] is the faCt that it can be read in two ways, either with a pause after Allah, 
so that ‘only God knows its interpretation, or with a pause after al-rasikhuna fi’l-'ilm, so that 'only God and those firmly rooted in 
knowledge know its interpretation. Broadly Sneaking, those who accept esoteric exegesis will naturally favour the latter reading. 
For what concerns this verse, the Jalalayn commentary clearly favours the former reading, emphasising, with the gloss ‘Him alone’ 
(wahdahu ), that only God can know such interpretation. The commentary is not concerned to make a distinction between the 
two terms, ta’wil and tafsir, precisely because the classical Sunni position, eSjooused by the Jalalayn, is againSt making a distinction 
between the two, since anyway if there is an esoteric aSJteCt to the Qur’an, only God can ever know it; in such a case, the terms 
ta’wil or tafsir become interchangeable, both in the context of God’s knowledge of the text and man’s attempts to understand it.

them, such as ! Ad and Thamud, who denied Our signs; God seized them. He destroyed them, for their 
sins (this statement explains the previous one); God is severe in retribution. When the Prophet (s) enjoined the Jews to enter into Islam, after his return from Badr, they said, 
‘Do not fool yourself just because you killed a few men of Quraysh, inexperienced and knowing noth¬ 
ing about fighting’, whereupon the following was revealed: Say, O Muhammad (s), to the disbelievers, 
from among the Jews, ‘You shall be vanquished ( sa-tughlabun, or [read] sa-yughlabun, ‘they shall be 
vanquished’), in this world, through being killed or taken captive and made to pay the jizya (which 
actually took place), and muttered, ([read] in both ways [wa-tuhsharuna, ‘you will be mustered’, or 
wa-yuhsharuna, ‘they will be mustered’]), in the Hereafter, to Hell, which you shall enter — an evil cra¬ 
dling!’, [an evil] renting place. There has already been a sign, an example (the verb qad kana, ‘there has been’, is used to separate 
[the statement to follow from the previous on e]), for you in two hotts, two parties, that met, one another 
in battle, on the day of Badr; one company fighting in the way of God, in obedience to Him, namely, the 
Prophet and his Companions, who numbered three hundred and thirteen men, mo ft of them on foot, 
with two horses, six plates of armour and eight swords; and another unbelieving; they, the disbelievers, 
numbering almoft a thousand, saw them, the Muslims, twice the like of them, that is, more numerous 
than themselves, as the eye sees, in manifeft vision, witnessing; and God granted them victory despite 
their fewer number; for God confirms, He ftrengthens, with His help whom He will, granting him vic¬ 
tory. Surely in that, which is mentioned, is a lesson for people of vision, those who are discerning: so 
will you not be warned by this and become believers?","Those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their children will avail them at all against Allah; it is they who are the fuel of the Fire. . [Their] case is like that of the people of Pharaoh and those before them. They all rejected Our signs, so Allah seized them for their sins, for Allah is severe in punishment. . Say to those who disbelieve: “You will soon be defeated and gathered into Hell. What a terrible resting place!” . There has been a sign for you in the two groups who confronted each other: one fighting for the cause of Allah, and the other disbelievers; they saw them, with their own eyes twice their number[7]. But Allah strengthens with His help whom He wills. There is a lesson in this for those who have insight.","[7] The believers saw the disbelievers to be double their own number preceding the battle of Badr, while, in fact, they were three times their number."

mentioned, is the comfort of the life of this world, enjoyed while it lafts, but then perishes; but God —

singled out here for mention because it is the time of unawareness and of the joy of sleep.","The love of desirable things has been made appealing to people, such as women, children, hoarded heaps of gold and silver, branded fine horses, livestock, and tilled land. These are the pleasures of the life of this world, but with Allah is the best place of return. . Say, “Shall I inform you of what is better than these?

Tafsir al-Jalalayn Lo!, the religion with God, pleasing [to Him], is submission [to the One God], ( al-islam ), that is to 
say, the Divine Law with which the messengers were sent, founded upon the affirmation of Gods One¬ 
ness (a variant reading [for inna, ‘lo!’] has anna, ‘that’, as an inclusive substitution for annahu to the end 
[of that verse, sc. shahida Llahu ... anna l-dina ‘inda Llahi l-isldm, ‘God bears witness that religion with 
God is Islam]). Those who were given the Scripture, the Jews and the Christians, differed, in religion, 
some affirming God’s Oneness, others rejecting it, only after the knowledge, of Oneness, came to them 
through transgression, on the part of the disbelievers, among themselves. And whoever disbelieves in 
God’s signs, God is swift at reckoning, that is, at requiting him. So if they, the disbelievers, dispute with you, O Muhammad (s), concerning religion, say, to them: 
7 have surrendered my countenance to God, [that is to say] I have submitted to Him, 1, and whoever 
follows me’ ( wajh, countenance’, is chosen here because of its noble character, for the other [parts of the 
body] will juSt as soon [surrender once the countenance has]); and say to those who have been given the 
Scripture, the Jews and the Christians, and to the uninStruded, the Arab idolaters: ‘Have you submit¬ 
ted?’, that is to say, ‘Submit!’ And so if they have submitted, they have been guided, from error, but if 
they turn their backs, to Islam, your duty is only to deliver, the Message; and God sees His servants, and 
so requites them for their deeds — this [Statement] was [revealed] before the command to fight [them] 
had been revealed.","Allah testifies that none has the right to be worshiped except Him, as do the angels and people of knowledge; He is the Upholder of justice. None has the right to be worshiped except Him, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. . The true religion with Allah is Islam. Those who were given the Scripture did not dispute except after the knowledge had come to them, out of mutual envy and rivalry. But whoever rejects the verses of Allah, then Allah is swift in reckoning. . Then if they argue with you, say, “I have submitted myself to Allah, and so have those who follow me.” And say to those who were given the Scripture and to the illiterate[10], “Have you submitted yourselves?” If they do, then they are rightly guided, but if they turn away, your duty is only to convey the message. And Allah is All-Seeing of His slaves.","[10] Those Arabs who had no scripture (i.e., the pagans)."
3,21,22,"Those who disbelieve in the signs of God and slay ( yaqtuluna, is also read as yuqatiluna, ‘they fight 
againSt’) the prophets without right, and slay those who enjoin to equity, to justice, and these are the 
Jews, who are reported to have killed forty-three prophets and to have been forbidden this by a hundred 
and seventy devout worshippers among them, each of whom was killed immediately. So give them good 
tidings, let them know, of a painful chastisement. The use of ‘good tidings’ here is meant as a sarcastic 
ridicule of them (the fa [of fa-bashshirhum, so give them good tidings] is considered part of the predi¬ 
cate of inna because its noun, that is, its relative clause, resembles a conditional [sc. in yakfuruna, ‘if they 
disbelieve...’, fa-bashshirhum, ‘then, give them good tidings...’]). Those are the ones whose works, what good they did in the way of charity and kindness to kin, 
have failed, [whose works] are invalid, in this world and the Hereafter, and so they have nothing to 
reckon with, since these [works] are of no consequence; they have no helpers, [no] protestors from 
the chastisement.","Those who reject the verses of Allah and kill the prophets unjustly, and kill those who enjoin justice among people; so give them tidings of a painful punishment. . They are those whose deeds have become worthless in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers.",
3,23,25,"Have you not seen those who were given a portion, a share, of the Book, the Torah, being called 
to the Book of God ( yud’awna, ‘being called’, is a circumstantial qualifier), that it might decide between 
them, and then a party of them turned away, opposed? to the acceptance of its rulings. This was revealed 
concerning the Jews: two of them fornicated and they [the Jews] asked the Prophet (s) to adjudicate the 
case. He ruled that they be Stoned, but they [the Jews] refused to do so. When the Torah was brought and 
consulted, the same verdidt was found, and so the two were Stoned, but they [the Jews] became wrathful. That, turning away and rejection was, because they said, ‘the Fire shall not touch us, except for 
a number of days’, that is, for forty days [only], the length of time their forefathers worshipped the calf, 
after which it would end; and the lies they used to invent, in their saying this, have deluded them in their 
religion (wa-gharrahum ft dinihim, ‘it has deluded them in their religion’, is semantically connected to 
ma kanu yaftaruna, ‘the lies which they used to invent’). But how will it be, their predicament, when We gather them for a day, that is to say, on a day, of 
which there is no doubt, no uncertainty, that is, the Day of Resurrection; and every soul, from among 
the People of the Scripture and others, shall be paid in full, the requital of, what is has earned, [what] it 
has done of good or evil, and they, that is, people, shall not be wronged?, in that no good deed shall be 
diminished, and no evil deed shall be increased.","Have you not considered those who were given a portion of the Scripture? They are invited to the Book of Allah to judge between them, and then a group of them turns away in aversion[11]. . This is because they say, “The Fire will never touch us except for a few days.” They have been deluded in their religion by that which they used to fabricate. . But how [terrible] will it be when We gather them together on a Day about which there is no doubt, and each soul will be fully recompensed for what it has earned, and none will be wronged?","[11] Referring to the Jews of Madinah who refused to implement the rulings of Allah in the Torah or to acknowledge the Prophet (ﷺ), whose coming was mentioned therein."
3,26,27,"When the Prophet (s) promised his community sovereignty over the lands of Persia and Byzan¬ 
tium, the hypocrites said, ‘How preposterous!’, and so the following was revealed, Say: ‘O God, Master 
of the Kingdom, you give the Kingdom to whom You will, from among your creatures, and seize the 
Kingdom from whom You will; You exalt whom You will, by giving it [the kingdom] to him, and You

abase whom You will, by seizing it from him; in Your hand, in Your power, is good, that is, as well as evil. 
You are Able to do all things. You make the night to pass, to enter, into the day and You make the day to pass, to enter, into the 
night, each of them increasing by the amount by which the other decreases; You bring forth the living 
from the dead, such as humans and birds, from perm-drops and eggs [repetitively]; and You bring 
forth the dead, the perm-drop and the egg, from the living, and You provide, with abundant provision,

3,28,30,"Let not the believers take the disbelievers as patrons, rather than, that is, instead of, the believ¬

God in anyway — unless you proted yourselves against them, as a safeguard (tuqatan, ‘as a safeguard’, 
is the verbal noun from taqiyyatan), that is to say, [unless] you fear something, in which case you may 
show patronage to them through words, but not in your hearts: this was before the hegemony of Islam 
and [the dipensation] applies to any individual residing in a land with no say in it. God warns you. He 
instills fear in you, of His Self, [warning] that He may be wrathful with you if you take them as patrons; 
and to God is the journey’s end, the return, and He will requite you. Say, to them: ‘Whether you hide what is in your breads, in your hearts, of patronage to them, or 
disclose it, manifest it, God knows it and, He, knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth; and 
God is Able to do all things, and this includes punishing those who patronise them. And remember, the day every soul shall find what it has done of good present before it, and what 
it has done of evil (the [lat statement constitutes the] subject, the predicate of which is [what follows]), 
it will wish that between it and that there were a great didance, an extremely lengthy distance so that 
it [the evil] could never reach it. God warns you of His Self (this is repeated for emphasis), and God is 
Kind to His servants.","Let not the believers take disbelievers as allies instead of believers, for whoever does so has nothing to do with Allah at all, except as a protective measure to save yourself from them[12]. And Allah warns you of Himself, and to Allah is the final return. . Say, “Whether you conceal what is in your hearts or reveal it, Allah knows it: He knows all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth. And Allah is Most Capable of all things.” . On the Day when every soul will find itself faced with whatever good it has done, and whatever evil it has done – it will wish that there were a great distance between it and its evil.

3,31,32,"When they said, ‘We only worship idols out of our love for God, that they might bring us close to 
Him, the following was revealed: Say, O Muhammad (s), ‘If you love God, follow me, and God will love 
you, meaning that He will reward you, and forgive you your sins; God is Forgiving, as regards the sins, 
committed previously, by one who [now] follows me; Merciful, to him. Say, to them: ‘Obey God, and the Messenger’, as regards the [belief in the] Oneness of God which 
he enjoins upon you. But if they turn their backs, [if they] objecft to obedience, God loves not the disbe¬ 
lievers, meaning that He will chaStise them (the [third person] pronominalisation [‘they’] is replaced by 
the overt noun [‘the disbelievers’]).","Say, “If you love Allah then follow me[13]; Allah will love you and forgive you your sins: for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” .

3,33,41,"Lo! God preferred. He has chosen, Adam and Noah and the House of Abraham and the House 
of‘Imran, meaning [He preferred] their selves [sc. Abraham and ‘Imran], above the worlds, by making 
prophethood reside in [them and] their progeny: the seed of one, offpring from, another, of them; God is Hearer, Knower. Mention, when the wife of‘Imran, Hanna, said, after she had reached old age and longed for a 
child, and supplicated to God and sensed that she was carrying child, ‘O, Lord, I have vowed to, offer, 
You what is within my womb as a consecration, [one] liberated and delivered from the distractions of 
this world for the service of Your Holy House [in Jerusalem]. Accept this from me. Lo! It is You Who are 
the Hearer, of petition, the Knower, of intentions. ‘Imran died while she was till pregnant. And when she gave birth to her, a girl, and she had been hoping for a boy, since only males were 
consecrated to the service of God, she said, apologetically, ‘O, Lord, I have given birth to a female’ 
— and God knew very well what she had given birth to: a parenthetical tatement constituting God’s 
peech (a variant reading [for wadaat, ‘she gave birth’, has wadatu, ‘I gave birth’ [making these Hanna’s 
words, sc. ‘and God knows very well what I have given birth to’]); the male, that she had asked for, is 
not as the female, that was bestowed upon her, because he is designed for the service [of God], while

she would not be suitable on account of her lesser physical ability, her private parts, the effects of men¬ 
struation on her, and so on. And I have named her Mary, and commend her to You with her seed, her 
children, to protect them from the accursed, the outcast, Satan’. In a hadith [it is Stated]: ‘Every new¬ 
born is touched by Satan and begins [life] by crying, except for Mary and her son, as reported by the two 
Shaykhs [Bukhari and Muslim]. Her Lord accepted the child, that is, He received Mary from her mother, with gracious accept¬ 
ance, and made her grow excellently. He made her grow up with excellent character. She would grow in 
a day by as much as a new-born grew during a year. Her mother took her to the prieSts, the keepers of the 
Holy House [of Jerusalem] and said: ‘This here before you is the dedication [I offered]’. They competed 
for [guardianship of] her, because she was the daughter of their religious leader, at which point Zacha- 
riah said, ‘I am moSt worthy of her, for, her maternal aunt lives with me’. 3 The others said, ‘No, [not until] 
we have caSt lots’. Thus, all twenty nine of them departed to the River Jordan, where they ca£t their quills, 
agreeing that the one whose quill remained fait and floated to the surface of the water would be most 
worthy of [being guardian over] her. Zachariah’s quill remained fait [and surfaced]. He took [charge of] 
her and built for her a gallery-room with a ladder in the temple, and none apart from him went up to 
her. He used to bring her food, drink and oil, and would find her with summer fruits in winter, and win¬ 
ter fruits in summer, just as God says, and Zachariah took charge of her, he took her to him (a variant 
reading [of kafalaha, ‘he took charge of her’] is kaffalahd, ‘He [God] gave Zachariah charge of her’, with 
Zakariyya, or Zakariyya, in the accusative and ‘God’ as the subjed of the verb). Whenever Zachariah 
went into the sanduary, that is, the room, the moil noble seat [in the temple], where she was, he found 
her with provisions. ‘O Mary,’ he said, ‘Whence comes this to you?’ She, dill very young, said, ‘From 
God, He sends it to me from Paradise,’ ‘Truly God provides, abundant provision, for whomever He will 
without reckoning’, without consequence. Then, when Zachariah had seen this and realised that the One with power to bring something 
about in other than its [natural] time, is able to bring about a child in old age, and with those of his family 
line all deceased, Zachariah prayed to his Lord, when he entered the sanduary to pray in the middle of 
the night, saying, ‘Lord, beStow upon me from You a goodly offspring, a righteous son, verily, You are 
the Hearer of, [You are] the One Who answers, supplication’. dud the angels, namely, Gabriel, called to him, Standing in the sanduary, in the temple, at wor¬ 
ship that (anna, means bi-anna; a variant reading has inna, implying a direcft speech statement) ‘God 
gives you good tidings (read yubashshiruka, or yubshiruka) of John, who shall confirm a Word, being, 
from God, namely, Jesus, that he is God’s Spirit; he is referred to as [God’s] ‘Word’, because he was cre¬ 
ated through the word kun, ‘Be’; a lord, with a following, and one chaSte, forbidden from women, and a 
prophet of the righteous’: it is said that he never sinned and never so intended. He said, ‘My Lord! How shall I have a boy, a son, when old age has overtaken me, that is, [after] 
I have reached extreme [old] age, 120 years [old]; and my wife is barren?’, having reached the age of 98. 
He said, ‘So it, the matter, will be’, with God creating a boy from both of you. ‘God does what He will’, 
nothing can prevent Him therefrom, and in order to manifest this great power he was inspired with the 
question so that he would be answered through it [this great power]. And when his soul longed for the 
swiff fulfilment of that of which good tidings had been given: He said, ‘My Lord! Appoint for me a sign’, that is, an indication of my wife’s pregnancy. He said, 
‘Your sign, for this, is that you shall not Speak to men, that is, you shall refrain from peaking to them, 
but not from remembrance of God, save by tokens, gestures, for three days, and nights. And remember 
your Lord often, and glorify, perform prayer, at evening and dawn’, at the end of the day and at its 
beginning.","Allah chose Adam and Noah, the family of Abraham, and the family of ‘Imrān above all people[14]. . They were descendants of one another. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. . [Remember] when the wife of ‘Imrān said, “My Lord, I dedicate to You what is in my womb[15], so accept it from me, for You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.” . When she gave birth, she said, “My Lord, I have given birth to a female child,” – and Allah knew best what she had given birth to – “and the male is not like the female. I have named her Mary[16], and I seek refuge with You for her and her offspring from Satan[17], the accursed.” . Her Lord graciously accepted her and caused her to grow in a good manner, and entrusted her to the care of Zachariah. Every time Zachariah entered her prayer chamber, he found with her some provision. He said, “O Mary, where did this come from?” She said, “It is from Allah, for Allah provides for whom He wills without measure.” . Thereupon Zachariah prayed to his Lord, saying, “My Lord, grant me by Your grace virtuous offspring[18], for You are the All-Hearer of prayers.” . The angels called out to him while he was standing in the chamber praying, “Allah gives you glad tidings of John, who will believe in the Word of Allah[19] and will be honorable, abstinent [from women], and a prophet from among the righteous.” . He said: “My Lord, how can I have a son when I have reached old age and my wife is barren?” He said, “Thus Allah does what He wills.” . He said, “My Lord, give me a sign.” He said, “Your sign is that you will not speak to people for three days except by gestures. And remember your Lord often and glorify Him in the evening and the morning.”","[14] Allah chose them above all people of their times: Adam whom He created with His own Hands, made the angels prostrate themselves to him; Noah (عليه السلام) whom He made the first bearer of His Message to humanity; Abraham (عليه السلام), the beloved of God, and his descendants among whom is a great number of prophets, including Muhammad (ﷺ); the Family of ‘Imrān: ‘Imrān and his wife, their daughter Mary and her son Jesus (عليه السلام), who is one of the greatest prophets of humanity. .

elected you, and made you pure, of the touch of men; He has preferred you above all women of the 
worlds, that is, the inhabitants of your time. O Mary, be obedient to your Lord, be compliant before Him, prostrating and bowing with those 
who bow’, that is, pray with those who pray. That, which has been mentioned of the matter of Zachariah and Mary, is of the tidings of the 
Unseen, of the news of what was unknown to you. We reveal it to you, O Muhammad (s), for you were 
not with them, when they were casting quills, in the water, drawing their lots so that it be manifested to 
them, which of them should have charge of, [which of them should] bring up, Mary; nor were you with 
them, when they were disputing, about the custodianship of Mary, such that you might have known it 
and related it; but truly you know it only through revelation.","And [remember] when the angels said, “O Mary, Allah has chosen you, purified you, and chosen you over all women. . O Mary, worship your Lord devoutly, prostrate yourself and bow down with those who bow down.” . This is from the stories of the unseen that We reveal to you [O Prophet]; you were not with them when they cast lots as to which of them should take guardianship of Mary, nor were you with them when they disputed about it.",
3,45,51,"Mention, when the angels, namely, Gabriel, said, ‘O Mary, God gives you good tidings of a Word 
from Him, that is, a boy, whose name is the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, He addresses her attribut¬ 
ing him to her in order to point out that she will give birth to him without a father, for, the cuStom is 
to attribute the child to its father, honoured shall he be in this world, through prophethood, and the 
Hereafter, through [his] intercession and the high Stations [al-darajat al-’ula, cf. Q. 20:75], an d of those 
brought close, to God. He shall Speak to mankind in the cradle, that is to say, as a child before the age of Speech, and in 
his manhood, and he is of the righteous’. She said, ‘Lord, how shall I have a child when no mortal has touched me?’, neither through con¬ 
jugality or otherwise; He said, the command, ‘It is such, that God will create from you a child without a 
father. God creates what He will. When He decrees a thing, willing its creation. He says to it only: “Be”, 
and it is, that is, [and] ‘he is’. And We will teach him (read nuallimuhu, or yu'allimuhu, ‘He will teach him) the Book, that is, 
script, wisdom, and the Torah, and the GoSpel. And He will make him, to be a messenger to the Children of Israel, during his tender years, or after 
puberty. Gabriel breathed into the opening of her garment and she became pregnant. What happened to 
her after this is mentioned later in surat Maryam [Q. 19:21ft]. Thus, when God sent him to the Children 
of Israel, he said to them, ‘I am God’s Messenger to you’, and, 7 have come to you with a sign, an indica¬ 
tion of my truthfulness, from your Lord, and it is that, I will create (a variant reading for [the particle 
introducing the relative clause] anni, ‘that I’, has inni, ‘truly I’, indicating a new [independent] sentence) 
[that] I will fashion, for you out of clay like the shape of a bird ( ka-hay’at, ‘something like the shape of’: 
the kaf is the subject of a passive participle) then I will breathe into it (fihi, the [suffixed] pronoun [-hi] 
refers to the [preceding] kaf), and it will be a bird (tayran, is also read tairan ) by the leave, the will, of 
God. So he created for them a bat, being the molt perfeCtly-created of birds, and they would watch it 
flying, but when it went out of sight, it would fall dead — so that the work of a creature [sc. Jesus] may 
be distinguished from the work of the Creator, namely, God, exalted be He, and that he might know that 
perfection belongs to God [alone]. I will also heal the blind ( akmah is one that is blind from birth) and 
the leper, these two are singled out for mention because with both afflictions the person is completely 
helpless. He [Jesus] was sent in an age of [characterised by] medicinal science, and he cured, through 
supplication, fifty thousand in one day on the condition that each person would become a believer; and 
I bring to life the dead, by the leave of God — He repeats this to preclude any false attributions of divin¬ 
ity to him — he brought back to life his friend ‘Azar, the son of an old woman, and the daughter of the 
tithe-collector, all of whom lived on and produced offering, and [he also brought back to life] Shem, son 
of Noah, but he died [again] immediately. I will inform you too of what things you eat, and what you 
treasure up, ftore, in your houses, and what I have never seen, and he would inform people what they 
had eaten and what they would eat. Surely in that, mentioned, is a sign for you, if you are believers. Likewise, I have come to you, confirming that which was before me of the Torah, and to make 
lawful for you some of that which was forbidden to you, in it. Thus he made lawful for them fish and

birds which had no Spikes; it is also said that he made it all lawful for them, so that bad, ‘some’, means, 
kull, ‘all’). I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, He has repeated it for emphasis and to expand 
upon it: so fear God, and obey me, in what I command you of affirming God’s Oneness and being obedi¬ 
ent to Him. Surely God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This, that which I enjoin upon you, is a 
Straight path’. But they rejected him and did not believe in him.","[Remember] when the angels said, “O Mary, Allah gives you glad tidings of a Word from Him[20], whose name will be the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary; honorable in this world and the Hereafter, and one of those near [to Allah]. . He will speak to people in the cradle[21] and in maturity, and he will be one of the righteous.” . She said: “My Lord, how can I have a child when no man has ever touched me?” He said, “Thus Allah creates what He wills. When He decrees something, He only says to it ‘Be’, and it is. .

His story with his mother, and he was falsely blamed for illegal sexual relations with a prostitute. The baby born out of this illegal relation spoke and declared his real father who was a shepherd and not Jurayj, so he was finally proven innocent. (The third was in the following story): A lady from the Children of Israel who wished his nursing child to become like a handsome rider who passed by, and not like a slave-girl who passed by, but the child spoke and wished to be the otherwise. When she asked her child about the reason, he said: ""The rider is one of the tyrants, while the slave-girl is falsely accused of theft and illegal sexual intercourse.""

3,52,53,"And when Jesus sensed, [when] he became aware of, their disbelief, and they plotted to kill him,

We believe in Allah; so bear witness that we are Muslims.” . “Our Lord, we believe in what You have sent down and we follow the messenger; so count us among those who bear witness [to the truth].”",
3,54,58,"God says: And they, the disbelievers among the Children of Israel, schemed, against Jesus, by as¬ 
signing someone to assassinate him; and God schemed, by casting the likeness of Jesus onto the person 
who intended to kill him, and so they killed him, while Jesus was raised up into heaven; and God is the 
beSt of schemers, in oil knowledgeable of him [Jesus]. And mention, when God said, ‘O Jesus, I am gathering you, seizing you, and raising you to Me, 
away from the world without death, and I am cleansing you of, removing you far away from, those who 
disbelieved, and I am setting those who follow you, those Christians and Muslims who believed in your 
prophethood, above those who disbelieved, in you, namely, the Jews, becoming above them through 
[definitive] argument and the sword, until the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me shall be your return, 
and I will decide between you, as to what you were at variance about, as regards religion. As for the disbelievers, I will chaStise them with a terrible chastisement in this world, through 
being killed, taken captive and made to pay the jizya, and the Hereafter, in the Fire; they shall have no 
helpers, none to protect them from it. But as for the believers, who do righteous deeds, He will pay them in full ( yuwaffihim, is also 
read nuwaffihim, ‘We will pay them in full’) their wages. God loves not the evildoers, that is. He will 
chaStise them. It is reported that God, exalted be He, sent him [Jesus] a cloud which raised him up, but 
his mother clutched to him in tears. He then said to her, ‘Verily, the Resurrection shall bring us together 
again. This took place on the Night of Ordainment (laylat al-qadr ) in the Holy House [of Jerusalem], 
when he was thirty three years old. His mother lived on after him for six years. The two Shaykhs [Bukhari 
and Muslim] narrate a hadith [in which it is Stated] that he [Jesus] will descend when the Hour is nigh 
and will rule according to the Law of our Prophet [Muhammad], and that he will slay the false messiah 
and the swine, break the cross and impose the jizya. In a hadith recorded by Muslim, he will remain for 
seven years; according to Abu Dawud al-TayalisI, [he will remain for] forty years, and he will die and 
have prayers performed over him. It is possible that what is meant [by the forty years] is the total time he 
will have SJient on earth, before he was raised and afterwards. This, what is mentioned of the matter of Jesus, We recite to you, narrate to you, O Muhammad (s), 
of verses and wise, clear, remembrance, namely, the Qur’an (min al-dydt, ‘of verses’ is a circumstantial 
qualifier referring to the [suffixed pronoun] ha’ of natluhu, and its operator is the demonstrative import

Then you will all return to Me, and I will judge between you concerning that over which you differed. . As for those who disbelieve, I will punish them severely in this world and the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers. . As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, He will give them their rewards in full, and Allah does not like the wrongdoers.” .

effectively. He created him, Adam, that is, his form, ofduft, then said He to him, ‘Be,’, a human being, 
and he was ; similarly, He said to Jesus, ‘Be’ — without a father — and he was. The truth is from your Lord ( al-haqqu min rabbik, the predicate of a missing subject, which is 
[implied to be] amr ‘Isa [‘the matter concerning Jesus’]); be not of those who waver, those who are un¬ 
certain about it. And whoever, from among the Christians, disputes with you concerning him, after the knowl¬ 
edge, of his affair, that has come to you, say, to them: ‘Come! Let us call our sons and your sons, our 
wives and your wives, our selves and your selves, and gather them together, then let us humbly pray 
and invoke God’s curse upon those who lie’, by saying: ‘Lord, curse the one that tells lies concerning the 
affair of Jesus’. The Prophet (s) had called upon the Najran delegation to do this when they diluted with 
him about Jesus. They said, ‘Let us think about it and we will come back to you’. The judicious one among 
them said, ‘You know that he is a prophet, and that every people that has ever challenged a prophet to a 
mutual imprecation has been destroyed’. They left him and departed. When they went to see the Prophet 
(s), who had set out with al-Hasan, al-Husayn, Fatima and ‘All, he said to them [the Najran delegation], 
‘When I supplicate, you say ‘Amen; but they refrained from this mutual imprecation and made peace 
with the Prophet on the condition that they pay the jizya, as reported by Abu Nu'aym. According to Ibn 
‘Abbas [the Prophet] said, ‘Had they set out and performed the mutual cursing, they would have gone 
home and found neither possessions nor family’. It is also reported that had they set out with this inten¬ 
tion, they would have been consumed by fire.","The similitude of Jesus before Allah[25] is like that of Adam; He created him from dust, then said to him, “Be,” and he was. . This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be of those who doubt. . Whoever disputes with you concerning [Jesus] after the knowledge has come to you, then say, “Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves, then invoke the curse of Allah upon the liars.”","[25] i.e., regarding His creation of him."
3,62,68,"This, mentioned above, is the true ftory, the report free of any doubt. There is no god but God, 
and assuredly God is Mighty, in His Kingdom, Wise, in His acftions. And if they turn their backs, rejecting faith, assuredly God knows the agents of corruption, and 
will requite them (here the [third person] pronominalisation has been replaced with the overt noun [al- 
mufsidun, ‘the agents of corruption’]). Say: ‘O People of the Scripture!, Jews and Christians, come now to a word agreed upon ( sawa, is 
the verbal noun, meaning muftawin amruha, ‘[a word] regarding which the matter is upright’) between 
us and you, and it is, that we worship none but God ( alia is [made up of] an-ld, ‘that.. .not’) and that 
we do not associate anything with Him, and do not take each other for lords, beside God’, as you have 
taken rabbis and monks; and if they turn their backs, in rejection of God’s Oneness, say, you to them: 
‘Bear witness that we have submitted’, [that we are of] those who affirm the Oneness of God. When the Jews claimed that Abraham was Jewish and that they were following his religion, and 
the Christians made a similar claim, the following was revealed: O People of the Scripture! Why do you 
argue about, dispute over, Abraham?, claiming that he belonged to one of your [two] religions, when 
the Torah was not revealed, neither the Gospel, but, a very long time, after him, and it was only after 
these two were revealed that Jewry and Christianity came into being. What, do you not comprehend?, 
the falsehood of what you say? Lo! (ha, ‘lo’, is for calling attention to something), You ( antum, ‘you’, is the subject) are those 
(the predicate is [what follows]) who dispute about what you know, concerning the affair of Moses 
and Jesus, and your claim to be adhering to their religions: why do you then dispute concerning that 
of which you have no knowledge?, of Abraham’s circumstances; and God knows, his circumstances, 
and you know not. God, in order to dissociate Abraham [from their claims], said: No; Abraham in truth was not a 
Jew, neither a Christian, but he was a Muslim, professing the Oneness of God, and a hanif, who in¬ 
clined away from all other religions towards the upright one; and he was never of the idolaters. Surely the people with the beTt claim, moSt worthy of, Abraham are those who followed him, 
during his time, and this Prophet, Muhammad (s) on account of his according with him as regards moSt 
[of the rulings] of his Law, and those who believe, from among his community, they are the ones that

ought to say, ‘We follow his religion, and not you; and God is the Protestor of the believers, their Helper 
and Preserver.","Indeed, this is the true narrative, and none has the right to be worshiped except Allah, and Allah is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. . If they turn away, then Allah is All-Knowing of those who spread corruption. . Say, “O people of the Book, come to a common term between us and you, that we worship none but Allah and associate no partners with Him, and that we do not take one another as lords besides Allah.” But if they turn away, say, “Bear witness that we are Muslims [submitting to Allah].” . O People of the Book, why do you dispute about Abraham[26], while the Torah and the Gospel were not sent down but after him? Do you not understand? . Here you are! You are those who disputed about that of which you have some knowledge, then why do you dispute about that of which you have no knowledge[27]? Allah knows and you do not know. . Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a monotheist[28] Muslim, and he was not one of the polytheists. . The closest people to Abraham are those who followed him, and this Prophet and those who believe. And Allah is the Guardian of the believers.",[26] Both the Jews and the Christians claimed Abraham as their own. . [27] Regarding the true faith of Abraham. . [28] Hanīf means a pristine believer. The basic semantic meaning of the root h-n-f is an inclination towards uprightness and eschewing crookedness.
3,69,74,"When the Jews called Mu'adh [b. Jabal], Hudhayfa [b. al-Yaman] and ‘Ammar [b. Yasir] 4 to [join] 
their religion, the following was revealed: There is a party of the People of the Scripture who yearn to make 
you go aStray; yet they cause none to dray, except themselves, because the sin for their leading [others] 
astray falls upon them, while the believers do not heed them in this; but they are not aware, of this. O People of the Scripture! Why do you disbelieve in God’s verses, the Qur’an, that includes all the 
descriptions of Muhammad (s), when you yourselves bear witness ?, [when] you know that it is the truth. O People of the Scripture! Why do you confound, [why do] you mix, truth with falsehood, by 
distorting and falsifying [scripture], and conceal the truth, the descriptions of the Prophet, while you 
know?, that it is the truth? A party of the People of the Scripture, the Jews, say, to some among them, ‘Believe in what has 
been revealed to those who believe, that is, the Qur’an, at the beginning of the day, and disbelieve, in it, 
at the end of it, so that they, the believers, might then turn back, from his [Muhammad’s] religion, and 
that they [the believers] will then say: these [Jews] are knowledgeable and they could only have turned 
away from it after accepting it because they know it to be false. And they also said: And do not believe except in one who (the lam of li-man, ‘in one who’, is extra) 
follows, accords with, your religion’. God, exalted be He, says, Say, to them, O Muhammad (s): ‘True 
guidance is God’s guidance, that is Islam, everything else being error (this statement is parenthetical) — 
that (an [and what follows] is the diredt objedt of the verb wa-la tu’minu, ‘do not believe’) anyone shoidd 
be given the like of what you have been given, of the Book, wisdom, and of the virtues (the term ahad, 
‘anyone’, from whom the exclusion is being made, precedes that which is being excluded, ‘the like of what 
you have been given’, the meaning being: ‘Do not affirm that anyone should be given this unless they fol¬ 
low your religion); or that they, the believers, should dispute with you, [that they should] prevail over 
you, before your Lord’, on the Day of Resurredtion, for you have the sounder religion (a variant reading 
has a-an, ‘such that’, the extra hamza denoting rebuke) in other words, [the Jews say do not believe] that 
another has been given the like of it, such that you might affirm it. God, exalted be He, says, Say: ‘Surely 
bounty is in God’s Hand; He gives it to whomever He will, so how can you say that no one else will be 
given what you have been given? God is Embracing, of ample bounty, Knowing, those who deserve it. He singles out for His mercy whom He will; God is of bounty abounding’.","A faction of the People of the Book wishes to mislead you [believers]; they do not mislead except themselves, but they do not realize. . O People of the Book, why do you disbelieve in the verses of Allah[29] while you testify [to their truth]? . O People of the Book, why do you mix the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth knowingly? . A faction of the People of the Book says, “Believe in what has been sent down to the believers in the morning and reject it in the evening, so that they may return [from their faith][30]. . And do not believe in anyone except those who follow your religion.” Say, “The guidance is the guidance of Allah.” [They say,] Lest someone may be given similar to what you have been given or argue with you before your Lord[31]. Say, “All bounty is in the Hand of Allah; He grants it to whom He wills. And Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing.” . He chooses for His mercy whom He wills; for Allah is the Possessor of great bounty.”","[29] About Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), while you have it written in your Books but you hide it. . [30] They hatched the plot of claiming to embrace Faith, only to disclaim it as untrue shortly thereafter, in order to sow the seed of doubt in the minds of the believers and thus abandon their religion. . [31] They fear that if people know what their Books really say, they would be on an equal footing with them, or that it be used as an argument against them."
3,75,77,"And of the People of the Scripture is he who, if you truSt him with a hundredweight, that is, with 
much money, he will return it to you, on account of his trustworthiness, the like of‘Abd Allah b. Salam 
to whom a man entrusted 1200 plates of gold, which he then returned to him; and of them is he who, 
if you truSt him with one dinar, will not return it to you, on account of his treachery; unless you keep 
Standing over him, not leaving him for one minute, for as soon as you leave him, he will deny it, as was 
the case with Ka‘b b. al-Ashraf, to whom a man from Quraysh entrusted a dinar and later denied it. 
That, refusal to return things, is because they say, ‘We have no duty towards, namely, [no possibility of 
acquiring] sin because of, the Gentiles’, the Arabs; for they considered it lawful to be unjuft: towards any 
person of a different religion, and they attributed [the source of] this convidtion to God, exalted be He. 
God, exalted be He, says, They Speak falsehood againSt God, by attributing such things to Him, while 
they are aware, that they are liars. Nay, there is a duty incumbent over them in this regard; but whoever fulfils his covenant, the one 
he has made or the covenant of God, by restoring a truft: and other such things, and has fear, of God, by 
refraining from disobedience and performing deeds of obedience, for truly God loves the God-fearing. 
‘He loves them’ means that He will reward them (the overt noun [al-muttaqin, ‘the God-fearing’] has 
replaced the [third person] pronominalisation).

Sura Al ‘Imran The following was revealed with regard to the Jews when they distorted the descriptions of the 
Prophet (s) and Gods covenant with them in the Torah, and [Gods covenant with them] regarding one 
that swears an oath to a falsehood when bearing witness or when selling merchandise: Those that sell, 
exchange, God’s covenant, with them that they believe in the Prophet and return faithfully what has been 
entrusted to them, and their own oaths, their invoking Gods name in mendacity, for a small price, of 
this world, there shall be no share, [no] lot, for them in the Hereafter; and God shall not ffieak to them, 
out of wrath against them, nor look upon them, [nor] have mercy upon them, on the Day of Resurrec¬ 
tion, nor will He purify them, cleanse them, and theirs will be a painful chastisement.","And among the People of the Book are some who, if you entrust with a heap of gold, will return it to you; yet there are others who, if you entrust with a single coin of gold, will not return it to you unless you keep standing over them. This is because they say, “We are under no obligation towards the Gentiles[32].” And they tell lies about Allah knowingly. . But those who fulfill their covenant and fear Allah, surely Allah loves those who fear Him. . Those who trade the covenant of Allah and their oaths[33] for a small price, they will have no share in the Hereafter. Allah will neither speak to them, nor look at them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and for them there will be a painful punishment.","[32] The Jews do not consider it a sin to cheat or lie to a gentile, i.e., a non-Jew. . [33] This covenant and oath is detailed in verse 81 below; that is, to believe in the prophethood of Muhammad (ﷺ) and support him."
3,78,80,"And there is a group, a party, of them, the People of the Scripture, like Ka‘b b. al-Ashraf, who twiSt 
their tongues with the Book, altering it by reciting it not according to the way in which it was revealed, 
but according to the way in which they have distorted it, as in the case of the descriptions of the Prophet 
(s) and other similar matters; so that you may suppose it, such distortion, as part of the Book, that God 
revealed; yet it is not part of the Book; and they say, ‘It is from God’, yet it is not from God, and they 
Speak falsehood againSt God, while they know, that they are liars. When the Christians of Najran claimed that Jesus had commanded them to take him as a Divinity, 
and some Muslims asked that they should be permitted to prostrate themselves before him, the Prophet 
(s), the following was revealed: It belongs not to any mortal that God should give him the Book, the 
Judgement, the understanding of the Divine Law, prophethood, then that he should say to men, ‘Be 
servants to me instead of God.’ Rather, he should say, ‘Be masters, scholars, labouring ( rabbaniyyun, 
‘those of the Lord’, is derived from rabb, ‘lord’, with the extra alif and nun, as a superlative [of rabbiyyim ]), 
by virtue of what you know ( ta’lamun, also read as tuallimun, ‘you teach’) of the Book and in what you 
Study’, that is, on account of the fa ft that you used to do this, for its benefit is that you engage in aCtion. He would never order you (read la ya’murukum, to denote a new clause, meaning ‘God [would 
not order you]’; or if read la ya’murakum, it would be a supplement to yaqiila, ‘he should say’, meaning 
‘ [it belongs not that... ] a mortal [should order you] ’); to take the angels and the prophets as lords, in the 
way that the Sabaeans have taken the angels, the Jews, Ezra, and the Christians, Jesus. Would He order 
you to disbelieve, after you have submitted? He would not do this.","And there are some among them who alter the Scripture[34] with their tongues so that you may think it is part of the Scripture, while it is not part of the Scripture; and they say, “It is from Allah,” while it is not from Allah. And they tell lies about Allah knowingly. . It is not for a human being whom Allah has given the Scripture, wisdom, and prophethood to say to the people, “Be my worshipers instead of Allah.” Rather, he would say, “Be devoted servants of your Lord because of your teaching of the Scripture and because of your study thereof.” . Nor would he order you to take angels and prophets as lords[35]. Would he order you to disbelieve after you have submitted to Allah [as Muslims]?","[34] The Scripture meant here is the Torah; by distorting its words or meanings. . [35] ‘Umar (رضي الله عنه) reported: I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say: ""Do not exaggerate in praising me as the Christians praised the son of Mary, for I am only a slave. So call me the slave of Allah and His Messenger."" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 654]"
3,81,83,"And, mention, when God made a covenant with the prophets, ‘What (if read lama, it would be 
introducing a subject clause, and emphasising the a.fpedt of the oath in this ‘making of the covenant’; 
if it is read lima, it would then be connected to the verb akhadha, ‘He took’; the md, ‘what’, is a relative 
particle in both cases, meaning la’lladhi [or li’lladhi respectively]) I have given you (dtaytukum, or in a 
variant reading, dtayndkum, ‘We have given you’) of the Book and wisdom; then there shall come to you 
a messenger confirming what is with you, of the Book and wisdom, and that is Muhammad (s) — you 
shall believe in him and you shall help him’ (this constitutes the response to the oath), if you reach his 
time and perceive him, and their communities [of descendants] follow them [in what is incumbent upon 
them]. He, God, exalted be He, said to them, ‘Do you affirm, this ? And do you take, [do you] accept, My 
load, My covenant, on you on that condition?’ They said, ‘We affirm’. He said, ‘Then bear witness, to 
this before your own souls and [those of] your followers, and I shall be with you among the witnesses’, 
before you and them. Then whoever turns his back, in rejection, after that, covenant, they are the wicked. What! Do they, the ones who turn away, desire ( yabghuna, is also read tabghuna, ‘[do] you desire?’) 
other than God’s religion, when to Him has submitted, [to Him] has yielded, whoever is in the heavens 
and the earth, willingly, without refusal, or unwillingly, by the sword and by seeing what it [such refusal] 
results in, and to Him they shall be returned? ( yurjauna, may also be read turjauna, ‘you shall be re¬ 
turned’; the hamza at the beginning of the verse [a-fa-ghayra, ‘what.. .other’] denotes a disavowal).","And [remember] when Allah took the covenant[36] of the prophets, [saying], “After I have given you the Book and wisdom, if there comes to you a messenger[37] confirming what is with you, then you must believe in him and support him.” Allah said, “Do you affirm this covenant and accept this commitment?” They said, “Yes, we do.” He said, “Then bear witness and I am with you among the witnesses.” . Whoever turns away after this, it is they who are the rebellious. . Do they seek other than the religion of Allah, whereas to Him submit all those in the heavens and on earth, willingly or unwilling, and to Him they will return?","[36] It is possible that this oath was taken when the offspring of Adam were taken out of his back, or taken from each prophet at the time of his mission.
 [37] This Messenger is Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)."
3,84,85,"Say, to them, O Muhammad (s): ‘We believe in God, and that which has been revealed to us, 
and that which has been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael, and Isaac and Jacob, and the Tribes, the 
latter’s sons; and in that which was given to Moses and Jesus, and the prophets, from their Lord; we 
make no division between any of them, by believing [in some] and disbelieving [in others]; and to

Him we submit’, devoting worship sincerely [to Him]. The following was revealed regarding those who apostatized and became disbelievers: Whoever 
desires a religion other than Islam, it shall not be accepted from him and in the Hereafter he shall be 
among the losers, because he will end up in the Fire, made everlasting for him.","Say, “We believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us and what was sent down to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his descendants, and what was given to Moses, Jesus, and other prophets from their Lord; we make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we submit.” . Anyone who seeks a religion other than Islam, never will it be accepted from him; and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers.",
3,86,91,"How shall God guide, that is to say, [He shall] not [guide], a people who have disbelieved after 
their belief, and bore witness, that is, [and after] their bearing witness, that the Messenger is true, and 
after the clear signs, the manifest proofs of the truth of the Prophet, had come to them? God guides not 
the evildoing, that is, the disbelieving, folk. Those — their requital is that there shall reft on them the curse of God and of the angels and of 
men altogether. Abiding therein, that is, in the curse, or in the Fire implied by it [the curse]; the chastisement shall 
not be lightened for them and they shall not be reprieved, they shall [not] be given any reSJute. But those who repent thereafter, and make amends, in their acftions, then truly God is Forgiving, 
Mercifid, to them. The following was revealed regarding the Jews: Surely those who disbelieve, in Jesus, after they 
have believed, in Moses, and then increase in unbelief, in Muhammad (s) — their repentance shall not 
be accepted, when they are drawing their laSt gaSJxs of life, or when they have died as disbelievers; those 
are the ones who go aStray. Surely those who disbelieve, and die disbelieving, the whole earth full, the amount needed to 
fill it up, of gold shall not be accepted from any one of them (the fa [oifa-lan yuqbala, ‘it shall not be 
accepted’] has been included in the predicate of the inna clause, because the Statement about alladhina, 
‘those [who disbelieve]’, resembles a conditional Statement; and as a declaration of the reason for it 
[repentance] not being acceptable in the case of one who dies in unbelief) if he would ransom himself 
thereby; for them awaits a painful chastisement (alim is [the same as] mu’lim, ‘painful’), and they shall 
have no helpers, to protecft them from it.","How would Allah guide a people who disbelieved after having believed and testified that the Messenger was true, and the clear signs had come to them? For Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. . The punishment of such people is that they are cursed by Allah, the angels, and all mankind. . They will abide therein forever. Their punishment will neither be lightened, nor will they be given respite, . except those who repent after that and mend their ways[38], for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. . But those who disbelieve after having believed then increase in disbelief, never will their repentance be accepted; it is they who have gone astray. . Those who disbelieve and die as disbelievers, even an earth full of gold will never be accepted from any of them, if offered as ransom[39]. For such people there will be a painful punishment, and they will have no helpers.","[38] After their disbelief and wrongdoing. . [39] The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""A disbeliever will be asked: ‘Suppose you had as much gold as to fill the earth, would you offer it to ransom yourself (from the Hell-Fire)?’ He will reply, ‘Yes.’ Then it will be said to him, ‘You were asked for something less than that (to join none in worship) with Allah, but you refused.

3,92,94,"You will not attain piety, that is, the reward for it, which is Paradise, until you expend, [until] you 
give voluntary alms, of what you love, of your wealth; and whatever thing you expend, God knows of it, 
and He will requite it accordingly. When the Jews said to the Prophet, ‘You claim that you follow the creed of Abraham, but Abra¬ 
ham did not eat camel’s meat nor drink its milk’, the following was revealed: All food was lawful to the 
Children of Israel save what Israel, facob, forbade for himself, namely, camels: when he was afflicfted 
with sciatica (‘irq al-nasa), he made a vow that if he were cured he would not eat of it again, and so it 
was forbidden him; before the Torah was revealed, which was after the time of Abraham, as it was not 
unlawful in his time, as they claimed. Say, to them: ‘Bring the Torah now, and recite it, so that the truth 
of what you say may become clear, if you are truthful’, in what you say; they were stupified and did not 
bring it [the Torah]. God, exalted be He, then said: Whoever invents falsehood againSt God after that, that is, after the proof has become manifest 
that the prohibition was made by Jacob, and not during the time of Abraham, those are the evildoers, 
that transgress the truth into falsehood.","You will never attain righteousness[40] until you spend in charity from what you love. Whatever you spend, Allah is All-Knowing of it. . All food was permissible for the Children of Israel except what Israel [i.e., Jacob] made impermissible for himself[41] before the Torah was sent down. Say, “Bring the Torah and recite it, if you are truthful.” . Whoever fabricates lies upon Allah after that – it is they who are the wrongdoers.","[40] ""Al-Birr"" is sincere piety which leads to the great bounty and Paradise. . [41] Israel (Jacob) became very ill and his illness dragged on for a long time, then he vowed that he would make unlawful for himself the drink and food he loved most should Allah cure him. The best food for him was camel meat and the drink he loved most was camel milk."

The firSt house, for worship, established for the people, on earth, was that at Bakka (a variant of Makka 
[Mecca], so called because it ‘crushes’ [ tabukku ] the necks of tyrants); it was built by the angels before the

Sura Al ‘Imran 


creation of Adam, and after it the Aqsa [in Jerusalem] was built, a period of forty years separating them, 
as reported in the hadlth of the two Sahlhs [sc. of al-Bukharl and Muslim], and in the hadlth [that states]: 
‘The fir£t thing to appear on the surface of the water, at the creation of the heavens and the earth, was a 
white foam, underneath which the earth was unrolled’; 5 a blessed place (mubarakan , a circumstantial 
qualifier referring to la’lladhl, ‘that’) meaning a place of blessings, and a guidance to all worlds, because 
it is their qibla. Therein are clear signs, among which is, the station of Abraham, that is, the Stone upon which 
he Stood to build the House, and on which his footprints remain; and it [the House] has endured all this 
length of time and the constant passing of hands over it. Among these [signs] are the fad that the reward 
for good deeds is multiplied in it and that birds never fly over it; and whoever enters it is in security, 
not liable therein to be killed or oppressed or otherwise. It is the duty of people towards God to make 
the pilgrimage to the House (read either as hijj al-bayt or hajj al-bayt, as two variants of the verbal noun 
from hajj, meaning ‘the intention [to journey there]’), if he is able to make his way there (man iStataa 
ilayhi sabilan substitutes for al-nds, ‘people’). The Prophet (s) explained this [ability] as having provisions 
and a ride, as reported by al-Hakim [al-Naysaburl] 6 and others. As for the one who disbelieves, in God 
or in what He has made obligatory with regard to the Pilgrimage, God is Independent of all worlds, the 
humans, the jinn and the angels, and [is Independent of] their devotions.","Say, “Allah has spoken the truth, so follow the religion of Abraham[42], exclusively devoted to Allah, and he was not one of the polytheists.” . The first House [of worship] established for mankind was the one at Bakkah [i.e., Makkah], full of blessings[43] and guidance for the worlds. . In it are clear signs [such as] the standing place of Abraham[44]; whoever enters it will be safe. Pilgrimage to the House is a duty owed to Allah upon all people who are able to make their way to it; whoever disbelieves, then Allah is in no need for the worlds[45].","[42] The creed of Ibrāhīm (millata Ibrāhīm) is the most primordial precursor to Islam. It is mentioned in the Qur’an in various places: 2:130, 3:95, 4:125, 6:161 and 16:123. . [43] Of this, is that people direct themselves toward it in prayer and head for it for ‘Umrah and Hajj. . [44] It is the stone on which Abraham (عليه السلام) stood while building the Ka‘ba. It is an everlasting sign of the relationship of Islam to Abraham’s creed. [45] He is in no need for His servants’ worship; it is they who are in need of Him."

God is Witness of what you do?’, and will requite you for it? Say: ‘O People of the Scripture, why do you bar believers, causing them to turn away, from God’s

unbelief and mendacity; instead He gives you respite until your appointed time and then requites you. The following was revealed when the Jews passed by the Aws and the Khazraj and were infuriated 
by their comradeship, and set about reminding them of their mutual hostility in the days before Islam, 
such that they caused them to quarrel and the two [tribes] were on the verge of fighting one another:

after you have believed, into disbelievers. How can you disbelieve (this is an interrogative of amazement and rebuke) while you have God’s 
verses recited to you, and His Messenger is in your midst? Whoever holds fail to, clings to, God, he is 
guided to a Straight path.","Say, “O People of the Book, why do you reject the verses of Allah when Allah is Witness to all what you do?” . Say, “O People of the Book, why do you hinder the believers from the way of Allah – trying to make it crooked when you are witnesses [to its truth][46]? But Allah is not unaware of what you do.” . O you who believe, if you obey a group of those who were given the Scripture, they will turn you back as disbelievers after your belief. . How can you disbelieve while Allah’s verses are being recited to you and His Messenger is in your midst? Whoever holds fast to Allah[47] is certainly guided to the straight path.","[46] They were devising schemes to deviate people while secretly bearing witness to the Truth mentioned in their Books. . [47] i.e., adhering strictly to His ordinances and to the Sunnah of His Prophet (ﷺ)."

thanked and not shown ingratitude, remembered and not forgotten. They said, ‘Who, O Messenger of 
God, is Strong enough for this [task]?’ But it was then abrogated by His Statement: So fear God as much

6 Muhammad b. ‘Abd Allah b. al Bayyi', al-Hakim al-Naysaburi (d. 403/1012) was a famous Shafi'i traditionisl, and a qadl for a 
time. His training in the transmission of hadlth took him across Iraq, Khurasan and Transoxania, in which period he is said to have 
heard traditions from about 2000 traditionisfs. He authored a number of compilations, including some important works on the 
science of hadlth, such as his Marifat 'ulum al-hadith and al-Madkhal fl iisul al hadllh. His most well-known and oft-cited work, 
however, is al-Muitadrak 'aid al-Sahlhayn, in which he included traditions omitted by Bukhari and Muslim, but which, by the 
criteria admitted by these two Shaykhs, should not have been left out; see, J. Robson, ‘al-Hakim al-Naysaburi’, E12, in, 82; Dhahabi, 
Siyar, xvii, 162-77.

you His signs that you might be guided. Let there be one community of you calling to good, to Islam, and enjoining decency, and forbid¬ 
ding indecency; those, that call, bid and forbid, are the successful, the victorious (the particle min, ‘of’, 
[in minkum, ‘of you’] is partitive, since what is mentioned is a collective obligation [fard kifaya], and is 
not incumbent upon every individual of the community, for not every person, such as the ignorant, is up 
to it. However, it is also said that this particle is extra, and what is meant is, ‘so that you are a community 
[calling to good and so on]’). Be not as those who scattered, in their religion, and disputed, over it, after the clear proofs came 
to them, and these are the Jews and the Christians, those there awaits a mighty chastisement. The day when some faces are blackened, and some faces whitened, that is, the Day of Resurrec¬ 
tion. As for those whose faces are blackened, these being the disbelievers, who are thrown into the Fire 
and to whom it is said in rebuke: ‘Didyou disbelieve after you had believed, on the day the covenant was 
made? Then taSte the chastisement for what you disbelieved!’ But as for those whose faces are whitened, and these are the believers, they shall be in God’s 
mercy, that is to say, in Paradise, abiding therein. Those, that is to say, these verses, are the verses of God which We recite to you, O Muhammad (5), 
in truth, and God desires not any injustice for the worlds, punishing them for no crime. To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth, as possessions, creatures and servants, 
and to Him all matters are returned.","O you who believe, fear Allah as He should be feared, and do not die except as Muslims. . And hold fast to the rope of Allah[48] all together and do not be divided. Remember the favor of Allah upon you when you were enemies, then He reconciled your hearts, making you brethren by His grace. And you were on the brink of a fiery pit and He delivered you[49] from it. This is how Allah makes His verses clear to you, so that you may be guided. . Let there be a group from among you who call to goodness: enjoining what is right, and forbidding what is wrong[50]. It is they who are successful. . Do not be like those who became divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them; and for them there will be a great punishment. . On the Day[51] some faces will turn bright while other faces will turn dark. As for those whose faces turn dark, [they will be told], “Did you disbelieve after having believed? Taste the punishment for your disbelief.” . As for those whose faces turn bright, they will be in Allah’s mercy[52], they will abide therein forever. . These are the verses of Allah; We recite them to you in truth. Allah does not want injustice to the worlds. . To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth, and to Allah will return all matters.","[48] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “I will leave with you after me two grave matters. The first is the Book of Allah. It is the rope of Allah; whoever follows it, is guided and whoever does not, has gone astray”. [Muslim: 2408]
 [49] The Prophet (ﷺ) addressed his Anṣār Companions after the Battle of Ḥunayn by saying: “Have I not found you: lost and Allah guided you by me? Destitute and Allah made you well-off by me? Divided and Allah united you by me?” [Muslim: 1061] . [50] According to the laws of Allah. . [51] i.e., the Day of Judgment. . [52] In Paradise."

them are believers, such as ‘Abd Allah b. Salam, may God be pleased with him and his companions; but 
moSt of them, the disbelievers, are wicked. They, the Jews, will not harm you, O company of Muslims, in anyway, except a little hurt, with 
their tongues, such as slander and threats; and if they fight againSt you, they will turn their backs to you, 
in retreat, then they will not be helped, againSt you, but you will be helped againSt them. Abasement shall be caSt upon them, wherever they are found, so that they have no Strength and 
no protection, save, if they be [clinging to], a rope of God, and a rope of the, believing , people, this being 
the latter’s covenant of security for them on the condition that they pay the jizya, in other words, they 
have no protection other than this; they have incurred, they have ended up, with anger from God, and 
poverty shall be caSt upon them; that, is, because they disbelieved in God’s signs, and slew the prophets 
without right; that ( dhalika is [repeated] for emphasis), is, because they disobeyed, God’s command, 
and used to transgress, passing from what is lawful into what is unlawful. Yet they, the People of the Scripture, are not all alike, equal; some of the People of the Scripture 
are a community upright, with integrity, adhering to the truth, such as ‘Abd Allah b. Salam, may God 
be pleased with him and his companions, who recite God’s verses in the watches of the night, that is, 
during its hours, prostrating themselves, performing prayer ( wa-hum yasjudun, ‘prostrating themselves’, 
is a circumstantial qualifier). They believe in God and in the LaSl Day, enjoining decency and forbidding indecency, vying 
with one another in good works; those, described in the way God has mentioned, are of the righteous, 
and some of them are not like this and are not righteous. And whatever good you do, O community, ( tafalii, ‘you do’, or if this is read yafalu, ‘they do’,

not be deprived of its reward, but you will be rewarded for it, and God knows the God-fearing.","You are the best nation ever raised for mankind: you enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, and believe in Allah. If the People of the Book had believed, it would have been better for them. Some of them are believers, but most of them are rebellious. . They can never harm you except for some annoyance. But if they fight you, they will turn their backs, then they will not be helped. . They are afflicted with humiliation wherever they may be[53], unless they are protected by a covenant from Allah or a treaty from the people. They have incurred Allah’s wrath and are afflicted with destitution. That is because they disbelieved in Allah’s verses and killed the prophets unjustly. That is because of their disobedience and transgression. . Yet all are not alike: there are some among the People of the Book who are upright[54]; they recite the verses of Allah during the night and they prostrate. . They believe in Allah and the Last Day; enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong; and hasten in doing good deeds. They are among the righteous. . Whatever good they do, their reward will never be denied; for Allah is All-Knowing of those who are righteous.","[53] This fate was imposed on the Jews by Allah, in part, in fulfillment of the divine promise to punish them severely, as found in 3:21. .

the way of enmity towards the Prophet or in the way of voluntary almsgiving or the like, is as the like¬ 
ness of a wind wherein is a blaft, of extreme hot or cold, that smote the tillage, the crops, of a people

not profit from it; so it is with what they expend, it perishes and they profit nothing from it. God did not 
wrong them, when they loSt what they expended, but they wronged themselves, through unbelief, which 
necessitated this loss.","Those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their children will ever avail them against Allah; they are the people of the Fire, they will abide therein forever. .

would love, they wish,/or you to suffer ([ al-’anat means] extreme hardship). Hatred, enmity towards

them!) Yet if you endure, their harm, and fear, God by [not] befriending them and so on, their guile 
will not hurt you (read either la yadirkum or Id yadurrukum ) at all; God encompasses what they do

Prophet (s) set out with 1000 or 950 men, while the idolaters numbered 3000. The Prophet pitched camp 
at the ravine on Saturday 7 th of Shawwal in year 3 of the Hijra. He had his back and that of his troops to 
Uhud. He arranged their lines and placed a group of archers under the command of‘Abd Allah b. Jubayr 7

Tafsir al-Jalalayn 

Haritha, the two flanks of the army, were about to lose heart, [about] to shrink from the battle and re¬ 
treat, after ‘ Abd Allah b. Ubayy, the hypocrite, and his companions began to retreat. He [Ibn Ubayy] said, 
‘Why should we get ourselves and our children killed?’ and he also said to Abu Jabir al-Salaml — who 
had said to him, ‘I implore you by God for your Prophet’s sake and yours’ — ‘If we knew how to fight, we 
would follow you!’ But God then made them [the Banu Salima and the Banu Haritha] Steadfast and they 
did not abandon [the field]; and God was their Protestor, their Helper, and let the believers rely on God, 
let them place their trust in Him and none other. When they were defeated, the following was revealed as a way of reminding them of God’s favour: 
God already gave you victory at Badr, a location between Mecca and Medina, when you were contempt¬ 
ible, few in number and weapons. So fear God, in order that you might be thankful, for His blessings. When ( idh, an adverbial qualifier of nasarakum, ‘He gave you vicftory’ [in the previous verse]) 
you were saying to the believers, promising them as reassurance [for them]: ‘Is it not sufficient for you 
that your Lord should reinforce you, [that] He should succour you, with three thousand angels sent 
down? (read munzalin or munazzalin, ‘sent down). Yea, it is sufficient for you. In [surat] al-Anfal [it is stated] with a thousand [Q. 8:9], because at firSt 
He reinforced them with this [thousand], then it became three [thousand] then five [thousand], as God 
says: if you are patient, in encountering the enemy, and fear, God in not contravening [His command], 
and they, the idolaters, come again ft you inftantly, your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels 
accoutred’ (read musawimmin or musawammin), that is to say, distinctively marked [for the battle]. In¬ 
deed, they were patient and God fulfilled His promise to them, so that the angels fought together with them 
riding upon piebald horses wearing yellow or white turbans, let loose down to their shoulders. What God ordained, that is, of reinforcement, was only as a good tiding to you, of vicftory, and 
that your hearts might be at peace, [that] they might be at reSt, and not be terrified by the large number 
of the enemy as compared to your small number. Victory comes only from God, the Mighty, the Wise, 
He gives it to whomever He will, and [vicftory comes] not because of a large army. And that He might cut off (li-yaqta‘, is semantically connected to the clause containing nasarakum, 
‘He gave you vicftory’), that is to say, that He might destroy, a party of the disbelievers, by slaying them 
or making them fall captive, or suppress them, humiliate them through defeat, so that they fall back, 
return, fruftrated, not having secured what they desired. When, on the Day of Uhud, the Prophet received a head wound and his front tooth was broken, 
and he said, ‘How does a people who have drenched the face of their Prophet in blood [expecft to] pros¬ 
per?’, the following was revealed: It is no concern at all of yours, nay, it is God’s concern, so be patient, 
whether, meaning, until such time as, He relents to them, through [their acceptance of] Islam, or chas¬ 
tises them; for they are indeed evildoers, by [virtue of their] disbelief. To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, as possessions, creatures and servants; 
He forgives whom He wills, forgiveness for, and chaftises whom He wills, chastisement for. And God is 
Forgiving, of His friends, Merciful, to those who obey Him.","And [remember] when you left your home in the morning to position the believers for the battle [of ’Uhud]; and Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. . When two parties[57] from among you were about to lose courage, but Allah was their protector. Let the believers put their trust in Allah. . Allah had helped you at Badr when you were weak; then fear Allah so that you may be grateful. . [Remember] when you said to the believers, “Will it not suffice you that your Lord will help you by sending down three thousand angels?” . Yes, if you stay patient and fear Allah, and the enemy should launch a surprise attack on you, your Lord will help you with five thousand marked angels. . Allah ordained this only as glad tidings for you, and to reassure your hearts thereby. Victory only comes from Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise, . in order to destroy a section of the disbelievers or disgrace them, so they may turn back utterly disappointed. . It is not for you [O Prophet] to decide whether He will accept their repentance or punish them, for they are wrongdoers. . To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills, and Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","[57] Allah reminds the believers of the reason for their setback in the Battle of Uhud. Essentially, the archers left their positions appointed for them by the Prophet (ﷺ)."

loan]. And fear God, by abandoning such [usury], so that you may proffer, [that] you may triumph. And fear the Fire that has been prepared for the disbelievers, left you be chastised with it. And obey God and the Messenger, so that you may find mercy.","O you who believe, do not consume usury[58], doubled and multiplied.

And those who, when they commit a shameful act or wrong themselves, remember Allah and seek forgiveness for their sins[60] – who can forgive sins except Allah? – and they do not persist in what they did knowingly. . Their reward is forgiveness from their Lord and gardens under which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. How excellent is the reward of those who do [righteous] deeds!","[59] Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) said: ""The strong is not the one who overcomes others by strength, but the strong is the one who controls himself while in anger."" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 135] . [60] Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) reported that the Prophet (ﷺ) said: “There is no Muslim who commits a sin, then performs ablution, prays two rak‘ahs and asks Allah for forgiveness without Allah forgiving him”.

3,137,144,"The following was revealed regarding the defeat at Uhud: Ways of life have passed away before

messengers, that is, how their affair ended in destruction. So do not grieve on account of their victory, I 
am only giving them recite until their appointed time. This, Qur’an, is an exposition for, all, mankind, and a guidance, from error, and an admonition 
for such as are God-fearing, among them. Faint not, shrink [not] from fighting the disbelievers, neither grieve, for what befell you at Uhud, 
for you shall prevail, through victory over them, if you are, truly, believers, (the response to this [last

that results from a wound and the like), already, at Badr, has touched the other people, the disbelievers. 
Such days We deal out in turn. We dispense them, among mankind, one day for one group, the next day 
for another, that they might be admonished, and that God may know, through knowledge manifested 
outwardly, those who believe, who are sincere in their faith from others; and that He may take witnesses 
from among you , 9 honouring them with martyrdom, and God loves not the evildoers, the disbelievers,

out [their punishment]. And that God may prove the believers, purifying them of sins through what befalls them, and 
efface, that is, destroy, the disbelievers. Or, nay, did you suppose you should enter Paradise without God knowing, through knowledge 
manifested outwardly, who among you have Struggled and who are patient, in [times of] hardship? You were longing for (tamannawna : one of the two letters ta has been omitted from the original 
[ tatamannawna ]) death before you met it, when you said, ‘Would that we had a day like the Day of Badr 
in order to attain what its martyrs attained.’ Now you have seen it, that is, the cause of it, war, looking on. 


8 The Arabic here allows for a paronomaftic gloss that is impossible to convey in English. For one, the Arabic term hal, which 
is generally translated as circumstantial qualifier, also means ‘a situation’, predicament’ etc. The expression hal muqaddara here 
simply means ‘an implied situation’: the present participle khalidina fihd suggests that the action of ‘abiding therein’ has begun (as 
opposed to saying yakhluduna fihd)-, but this ‘abiding’ in Paradise can only happen when they enter it (which is in the unknown 
future), a situation, in other words, that has not yet come into existence. Thus, the usual rendering of hal as circumstantial qualifier 
is not satisfactory in this case. In addition, the follow-up gloss muqaddarinal-khulud, despite using the same verbal root q-d-r, does 
not so much refer to anything ‘virtual’ as it does to the fact that God has ‘decreed for them to abide therein’: the word muqaddar 
means ‘decreed’, as well as ‘implied’ or ‘virtual’. One possibility might be to translate both q-d-r forms using the same English root: 
a ‘foreordained situation’, that is, it is foreordained that they abide in it once they enter it; but this does not convey the technical 
grammatical import of hal in the former. 

9 The English word ‘martyr’, from the Greek martur, has loft its original connotation of ‘a witness’, a person who through his or 
her death teftifies to the truth of the faith; what is rendered by two different words in English is the one in Arabic, shahid (pi. 
shuhada’).

If you have suffered a blow [at ’Uhud], they too have suffered a blow like it [at Badr]. We alternate among people these days, so that Allah may reveal the believers and may choose martyrs from among you. And Allah does not like the wrongdoers. . And so that He may purify the believers and annihilate the disbelievers. . Do you think that you would enter Paradise when Allah has not yet seen those of you who struggled in His way and those who remained patient? . You did wish for martyrdom[62] before facing it, and now you have seen it with your own eyes. . Muhammad is no more than a messenger; there were messengers who passed away before him[63]. If he dies or is killed, will you turn back on your heels[64]? Anyone who turns back on his heels will not harm Allah in the least, but Allah will reward those who are grateful.","[61] The reins are slackened for the disbelievers to further lure them into the trap of their annihilation and the deliverance of the believers is assured after putting them to the test. . [62] This is a reminder to the believers, who missed the Battle of Badr, of their talk about wishing to meet the enemy and being martyred. The Battle of Uhud is being alluded to here, as solid intentions and steadfastness are what actually win battles, not mere fancy talk. . [63] The laws of nature apply to them too.
 [64] This smacks the faltering position that some Muslims took when it was rumored during the Battle of Uhud that Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) had met his death."
3,145,148,"It is not for any soul to die, save by the leave of God, by His decree, a prescribed ( kitdban, 
here a verbal noun, that is, God has prescribed this) term, that is to say, [a term fixed] in time, neither 
brought forward nor deferred, so why did you retreat [in defeat]? Defeat does not ward off death, nor 
does standing one’s ground sever life. And whoever desires, by his deeds, the reward of this world, that 
is, his requital in it, We will give him of it, what has been alloted to him, but he shall have no share in the 
Hereafter; and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, We will give him of it, that is, of its reward; 
and We will requite the thankfid. How many a prophet has been killed (qutila, a variant reading has qatala, ‘has fought’, the subject 
of the verb being the person governing it) 10 and with him (maahu, the predicate, the subject of which 
[follows]) thousands manifold [fought], but they fainted not,"" they did [not] shrink, in the face of what 
afflided them in God’s way, of wounds and the slaying of their prophets and companions; they neither 
weakened, in the face of druggie, nor did they humble themselves, [nor did they] succumb to their en¬ 
emy, as you did when it was said that the Prophet (s) had been killed. And God loves the patient, during 
trials, meaning that He will reward them. All that they said, when their prophet had been killed while they dood their ground and were 
deadfad, was, ‘Our Lord, forgive us our sins and our excesses, our overdepping the bounds, in our 
affairs, a declaration of the fad that what had befallen them was the result of their evil adions and a 
humbling of their selves, and make firm our feet, with drength for the druggie, and help us againd the 
unbelieving folk’. And God gave them the reward of this world, vidory and booty, and the faired reward of the 
Hereafter, that is, Paradise ( husnuhu, ‘the faired of it’, denotes [extra] favour in addition to what is de¬ 
served); and God loves the virtuous.","No soul can die except with Allah’s permission at a destined time[65]. Whoever seeks the reward of this world, We will give him thereof, and whoever seeks the reward of the Hereafter, We will give him thereof. And We will reward those who are grateful. . [Imagine] how many prophets along with the devout men fought, but they did not lose heart because of what they suffered in the way of Allah, nor did they weaken or surrender. And Allah loves those who are patient. . All they said was, “Our Lord, forgive us our sins and our excess in our affairs, make firm our feet, and give us victory against the disbelieving people[66].” . So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the best reward of the Hereafter[67], for Allah loves those who do good.",[65] This fact is stated as an encouragement to fight in Allah’s cause. .

10 The Jalalayn have qutila (‘killed’) as their standard reading, giving the variant as qatala (‘fought’), the former also being the pre¬ 
ferred reading of Tabari ( ]dmi‘ al-baydn, m.ii, 155, sub Q. 3:146): in this case it is the prophet who is ‘killed’, while the ad of‘not 
shrinking nor weakening’ applies to the ribbiyyun fighting alongside him. Tabari argues in favour of this reading on the premise 
that it accords better with the import of the previous verse where God reproaches those who might abandon the druggie on hear¬ 
ing news of their Prophet’s death. The other reading, however, is qatala, which makes better sense within the grammatical structure 
of the same verse, especially given the consequential particle (fa-) that follows: one cannot shrink or weaken after one’s been killed. 
In addition, this lad reading is supported by Zamakhshari (d. 538/1144) in his commentary where he includes a report from Sa'id 
b. Jubayr (d. 95/713) to the effed that no prophet is known to have been killed in battle (see Kashshaf, 1, 469, sub Q. 3:146). 

11 Medieval lexicons offer two derivations for the term ribbiyyun, since generally Speaking only one of these two etymologies is 
recognised by individual philologids. Thus, al-Akhfash (d. 177/793), teacher of the famous Sibawayhi, derived the term from rabb, 
‘lord’, so that ribbi was akin to rabbani, rabbi, (lit. ‘a man of the Lord’); this is also the preferred underdanding of both al-Raghib 
al-Isfahanl (d. ca. 425/1033) in his lexicon of Qur’anic expressions (al-Mufradat, 337) and of Zamakhshari. Al-Farra’ (d. 207/822) 
and al-Zajjaj (d. 311/923), however, derive the term from the singular form rabba, which means a large group or a thousand (or ten 
thousand). Tabari’s preference is for this lad and it is obviously the preference of the Jalalalyn judging by their gloss.

Sura Al ‘Imran 


Uhud they resolved to return in order to exterminate the Muslims, but they were terrified and did not 
return; for what they have associated, because of their associating, with God that for which He has re¬ 
vealed no warrant, that is, [no] argument in support of its worship, namely, idols; their abode shall be 
the Fire; evil is the abode, the renting place, of the evildoers, the disbelievers.","O you who believe, if you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back on your heels, and thus you will return as losers. . But Allah is your Protector, and He is the Best of Helpers. . We will cast dread into the hearts of those who disbelieve because they associated partners with Allah for which He has not sent down any authority. Their refuge will be the Fire. How terrible is the abode of the wrongdoers!",
3,152,155,"God has been true to His promise, towards you, of giving you vicftory, when you slew them by 
His leave, by His will, until you loft heart, [until] you shrank from battle, and quarrelled, disagreed, 
over the command, that is, the command of the Prophet (s) that you remain at the foot of the mountain 
for the arrow attack, some of you saying, ‘Let us depart, for our comrades have been given vicftory’, oth¬ 
ers saying, ‘We should not disobey the command of the Prophet (s)’; and you disobeyed, his command, 
and abandoned your station in search of the booty, after He, God, had shown you what you longed for, 
of assistance (the response to the [clause containing] idha is indicated by what precedes it, that is to say, 
‘[when you loSt heart] He denied you His assistance’). Some of you desired this world, abandoning his 
Station for the sake of the booty; and some of you desired the Hereafter, holding to it until he was slain, 
such as ‘Abd Allah b. Jubayr and his companions. Then He turned you away (thumma sarafakum is a 
supplement to the response of the [clause containing] idha, implied to be raddakum bi’l-hazima [‘He 
turned you back in defeat’]) from them, the disbelievers, so that He might try you, that He might teSt 
you and so make manifest the sincere ones from those otherwise; yet now He has pardoned you, what 
you have done, and God is Bounteous to the believers, with pardon. Remember, when you were ascending, fleeing in the distance, not turning around, [not] Stop¬ 
ping, for anyone and the Messenger was calling you from your rear, saying, ‘Come to me servants of 
God, this way, servants of God!’, so He rewarded you. He requited you, with grief, through defeat, for 
grief (ghamman bi-ghamm; the ba [bi-], ‘with’, is said to mean ‘ala, ‘for’) because of the grief that you 
caused the Prophet when you disobeyed [his command], that is, [with grief] doubled, [being] in addi¬ 
tion to the grief of the booty forfeited, so that ( li-kayla is semantically connected either to ‘afa, ‘He has 
pardoned’, or athabakum, ‘He rewarded you’; the Id [of kay-ld ] is thus extra) you might not grieve for 
what escaped you, of booty, neither for what befell you, of being slain and [of] defeat; and God is aware 
of what you do. Then He sent down upon you, after grief, security — a slumber (nu’dsan, ‘slumber’ substitutes 
for amanatan, ‘security’) overcoming ( yaghsha or taghsha) a party of you, namely, the believers. They 
would become dizzy under their shields and their swords would fall from their hands; and a party whose 
own souls diftressed them, that is, they caused them grief, so that their only wish was their deliverance, 
regardless of the Prophet and his Companions, and they were unable to fall asleep: these were the hypo¬ 
crites; thinking wrongly of God, thoughts of, those thoughts during the, age of ignorance, the moment 
they thought that the Prophet had been killed or that he would not be given vicftory, saying, ‘Have we 
any part whatever in the affair?’ (read [interrogative] hal as [negative] md) that is, [we have no part 
in] the assistance which we were promised. Say, to them: ‘The affair belongs entirely (read accusative 
kullahu to denote an emphasis, or nominative kulluhu as a subjecft [of a new sentence], the predicate of 
which is [what follows]) to God’, that is to say, the decree is His, He does what He wills. They conceal 
within their hearts what they do not disclose, what they [do not] manifest, to you, saying, ( yaquluna, 
‘saying’, is an explication of the preceding [Statement]) ‘Had we had any part in the affair, we would 
not have been slain here’, that is to say, ‘Had the choice been ours, we would not have set out and thus 
been slain; but we were forced to set out’. Say, to them: ‘Even if you had been in your houses, with some 
among you whom God had appointed that they be slain, those, of you, for whom it had been appointed, 
decreed, that they be slain would have sallied forth, would have gone forth, to the places where they 
were to lie’, the battleground where they were to fall, and they would have been slain; and their Staying 
put [at home] would not have saved them, for God’s decree will be, inevitably. And, He did what He did 
at Uhud, that God might try, [that He might] teSt, what was in your breafts, your hearts, of sincerity 
or hypocrisy, and that He might prove, [that He might] distinguish, what was in your hearts; and God 
knows what is in the breafts, what is in the hearts. Nothing can be hidden from Him, and He tries people 
only to make [matters] manifest for them. Truly, those of you who turned away, from the battle, the day the two hofts, the Muslim hoSt and

— truly, Satan made them slip, with his [evil] insinuations, through some of what they had earned, of 
sins, namely, when they disobeyed the Prophets command; but God pardoned them; God is Forgiving, 
to believers, Forbearing, hastening not against the disobedient [with punishment].","Indeed, Allah fulfilled His promise to you when you were slaying them by His permission, until you lost courage and disputed over the command and disobeyed after He had shown you what you liked [victory]. Among you are some who seek this world and some who seek the Hereafter[68]. He then prevented you from [defeating] them so that He may test You, but He pardoned you, for Allah is Most Gracious to the believers. . [Remember] when you were fleeing without even casting a glance at anyone, and the Messenger was calling you back. You were then given distress[69] upon distress, so you should not grieve for what you missed or for what you suffered. For Allah is All-Aware of what you do. . Then He sent down tranquility upon you after distress: a slumber overtaking a group of you[70], while another group[71] cared only about themselves, having false thoughts about Allah, the untrue thoughts of ignorance, saying, “Do we have any say in the matter?” Say, “All matters belong to Allah.” They conceal in their hearts what they do not reveal to you. They say, “If we had any say in the matter, none of us would have been killed here.” Say, “Even if you had been in your homes, those among you who were destined to be killed would have come out to their killing places.” But Allah did this so that He may test your inner thoughts and distinguish what is in your hearts. For Allah is All-Knowing of what is in the hearts. . Those of you who fled on the day when the two armies met [at ’Uhud], it was Satan who made them slip due to some of their misdeeds, but Allah has pardoned them, for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.","[68] The first party were the archers who left their positions to collect the spoils, while the latter were those who remained at their posts. .

not have died and would not have been slain ’, in other words, do not say as they say — so that God may 
make that, saying [of theirs], as a conclusion of their affair, anguish in their hearts. For God gives life,

slain, in the [holy] struggle or otherwise, it is to God, and to none other than Him that, you shall be 
muttered, in the Hereafter, and He will requite you.","O you who believe, do not be like those who disbelieved and said about their brothers who traveled through the land or engaged in battle, “If they had stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed[72].” Allah makes that a cause of distress in their hearts. It is Allah Who gives life and causes death, and Allah is All-Seeing of what you do. . If you are killed in the way of Allah or die, then forgiveness and mercy from Allah are far better than what they accumulate. . If you die or are martyred, it is unto Allah that you will be gathered[73].","[72] A believer should know for certain that all matters, including life and death, are in the Hands of Allah alone. .

3,159,160,"It was by the mercy of God that you, O Muhammad (s), were lenient with them, that is, [that] 
you showed indulgence [toward them] when they disobeyed you; had you been harsh, ill-natured, and 
fierce of heart, brutish and coarse towards them, they would have dispersed, ,<]ilit away, from about 
you. So pardon them, pass over what they have done, and ask forgiveness for them, for their sins, until 
I forgive them, and consult them, find out their opinions, in the matter, that is, your affair in the battle 
and otherwise, in order to win their hearts over and so that you may be emulated [in this reseed]; and 
indeed, the Prophet (s) would frequently consult them. And when you are resolved, to carry out what 
you wish after counsel, rely on God, put your trus ‘1 in Him and not in [any] counsel; for God loves those

none can overcome you; but if He forsakes you, [if] He refrains from assisting you, as on the Day of 
Uhud, then who is there who can help you after Him?, that is, after His forsaking [you] ? In other words, 
there is no one to help you. Therefore on God, and on no one else, let the believers rely.","It is by Allah’s mercy that you [O Prophet] became lenient to them[74]. If you had been harsh and hard-hearted, they would have dispersed from you. So pardon them, seek forgiveness for them, and consult them in important matters[75]. But once you have made a decision, put your trust in Allah, for Allah loves those who put their trust in Him. . If Allah helps you, none can overcome you; but if He forsakes you, who is there to help you after Him? In Allah let the believers put their trust.","[74] In the Battle of Uhud, the Prophet (ﷺ) was made to show leniency to the believers who disobeyed his commands.

3,161,163,"When some red velvet cloth went missing on the Day of Badr and some people began to say, ‘Per¬

a variant reading has the passive an yughalla, meaning to attribute ghulul, ‘fraud’, to him), to be treacher¬ 
ous with regard to the Spoils, so do not presume this of him; whoever defrauds shall bring what he has 
defrauded on the Day of Resurrection, carrying it around his neck; then every soul, the fraudulent and 
the otherwise, shall be paid in full, the requital of, what it has earned, [what] it has done, and they shall 
not be wronged, a single thing. Is he who follows God’s beatitude, being obedient and not defrauding, like him who is laden, 
[one who] returns, with God’s anger, because of his disobedience and fraud, whose abode is Hell? An 
evil journey’s end, a resort, it is! No! They are of degrees, that is, individuals of [different] degrees, before God, that is, belonging 
to varying stations: for those that follow His beatitude, a reward, and for those that are laden with God’s 
anger, punishment; and God sees what they do, and will requite them for it.","It is not for a prophet to misappropriate the spoils of war. Whoever misappropriates will carry it with him on the Day of Resurrection[76]. Then every soul will be paid in full for what it has earned, and none will be wronged. . Is the one who seeks Allah’s pleasure like someone who incurs Allah’s wrath, and whose abode is Hell? What a terrible destination! . They are of various ranks with Allah, and Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.","[76] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “By Allah none of you wrongfully appropriates part of it (war booty) without him meeting Allah on the Day of Judgment carrying it. I shall know everyone of you who meets Allah carrying a camel grunting, a cow bellowing, or a goat bleating...” [Al-Bukhārī: 6979, Muslim: 1832]. Al-Qurṭubī (4:256) comments: “He comes carrying it on his back and neck, tormented by its weight, horrified by its atrocious sound, and berated by making his dishonesty known to all people…”."

say, in amazement, ‘How is this?’, that is, how did this defeat happen to us when we are Muslims and

How is it that, when you suffered a calamity[78] [at ’Uhud] while you had inflicted twice as much upon them[79] [at Badr], you said, “How could this happen?” Say, “You brought this to yourselves.

God and in certainty, and they said, ‘God is sufficient for us. He will deal fully for us with their affair; an 
excellent Guardian is He’, the One to whom the matter is entrusted. They thus set out with the Prophet

his followers and so they did not turn up. They [the believers] had merchandise with them, and so they 
traded and made profits. God, exalted be He, says: So they returned, from Badr, with grace and bounty from God, safely and with profit, and no 
evil touched them, from any slaying or wounds; and they followed the beatitude of God, by obeying 
Him and obeying His Messenger, when they [agreed to] set out [for the battle]; and God is of bounty

Do not fear them, but fear Me, if you are [true] believers.","[80] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “When your brothers were killed in the Battle of Badr, Allah placed their souls in the (abdominal) cavities of green fowls, drinking from the rivers of Paradise, eating from its fruits and coming back at the end of the day to repose in chandeliers hung in the Shadow of the Majestic Throne. For all of this, they said: “Who would tell our brothers about us; that we are in Paradise being provided for so that they may not give up fighting in the way of Allah or cower in war?” Allah Almighty said: “I will tell them on your behalf”. Then He revealed: “Do not think that those who were killed in the way of Allah are dead. Nay but they are alive with their Lord being provided for”.

They were deeply wounded and bruised in the Battle of ’Uhud. . [82] The believers.
 [83] The hypocrites. [84] This is one of the greatest Dhikr (remembrance) during times of hardship. Ibn ‘Abbās (رضي الله عنهما) reported: “Hasbunā Allāh wa ni‘ma al-Wakīl (Allah suffices us, He is the best of Protectors), was said by Abraham (عليه السلام) when he was thrown in the fire and was said by Muhammad (ﷺ) when it was said: “People have regrouped for you, so fear them”, their belief grew firmer and they said: “Allah suffices us, He is the best of Protectors”.” [Al-Bukhārī: 4563]"

grieve’, an alternative expression to [4 th form] ahzanahu, ‘he made him grieve’) those that vie with one 
another in unbelief, succumbing to it promptly by supporting it, namely, the Meccans or the hypocrites: 
in other words, do not be concerned for their unbelief; they will not hurt God at all, by their adtions, 
only hurting themselves. God desires not to assign them any portion, any lot, in the Hereafter, that is, in 
Paradise, and that is why God forsook them; and theirs is a mighty chastisement, in the Fire. Those who purchase unbelief at the price of faith, that is, taking it in place of it, they will 
not hurt God at all, with their unbelief, and there awaits them a painful chastisement ( alim means 
mu’lim, ‘painful’). And let not the disbelievers suppose (read layahsabanna, ‘let them not suppose’, or Id tahsabanna, 
‘do not suppose’) that what We indulge them in, that is, [that] Our indulging [them], in extending their 
[terms of] life and deferring them [their death], is better for their souls (in the case of the reading 
yahsabanna, ‘let them [not] suppose’, anna [of anna-ma ] and its two operators Stand in place of the two 
objects, but only in place of the second in the case of the other reading [tahsabanna], ‘do [not] suppose’). 
We grant them indulgence. We give [them] refute, only that they may increase in sinfidness, through 
frequent disobedience, and theirs is a humbling chastisement, one of humiliation, in the Hereafter. It is not God’s purpose to leave, to abandon, the believers in the Slate in which you, O people, 
are, where the sincere are intermingled with those otherwise, till He shall distinguish (read yamiza or 
yumayyiza), [till] He separates, the evil one, the hypocrite, from the good, the believer, through the bur¬ 
densome obligations that will reveal this [distinction] — He did this on the Day of Uhud. And it is not 
God’s purpose to apprise you of the Unseen, so that you could recognise the hypocrites from the oth¬ 
ers, before the distinguishing; but God chooses. He selects, of His messengers whom He will, apprising 
him of [some of] His Unseen, as when He apprised the Prophet (s) of the position of the hypocrites. So 
believe in God and His messengers; and if you believe and guard againSt, hypocrisy, then yours shall 
be a great wage. Let them not suppose (read la yahsabanna, ‘let them not suppose’, or la tahsabanna, ‘do not 
suppose’) those who are niggardly with what God has given them of His bounty, that is, with His ob¬ 
ligatory almsgiving, that it, their niggardliness, is better for them ( khayrun lahum, is the second direct

to him that the Prophet famously said, ‘War is trickery’ ( al-harb khud'a), when the former offered to confuse the ranks of the Meccan 
enemy, who all the while presumed Nu'aym to be on their side. Nu'aym is said to have died during the caliphate of ‘Uthman b. ‘Affan,

nay, it is worse for them; what they were niggardly with, namely, the obligatory almsgiving of their 
wealth, they shall have hung around their necks on the Day of Resurrection, when he will have a snake 
around his neck biting viciously at him, as reported in a hadith; and to God belongs the inheritance of 
the heavens and the earth, inheriting them after the annihilation of their inhabitants. And God is aware 
of what you do ( ta’maluna, also read ya’maluna, ‘they do’), and will requite you for it.","Do not let those[85] who hasten to disbelief grieve you; they can never harm Allah in the least. It is Allah’s will that they will have no share in the Hereafter, and for them there will be a great punishment. . Those who purchase disbelief [in exchange] for faith can never harm Allah in the least, and for them there will be a painful punishment. . Those who disbelieve should not think that whatever respite We give them is good for them. We only give them respite so that they may increase in sin, and for them there will be a disgracing punishment. . Allah would not leave the believers in the state you are in, until He distinguishes the evil from the good[86], nor would Allah reveal to you [believers] the unseen, but Allah chooses from His messengers[87] whom He wills. So believe in Allah and His messengers; if you believe and fear Allah, you will have a great reward. . Those who greedily withhold what Allah has given them of His grace, should not think that it is good for them, rather it is bad for them; their necks will be chained[88] by what they greedily withheld on the Day of Resurrection. To Allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and earth, and Allah is All-Aware of what you do.","[85] The hypocrites. . [86] Hypocrites were initially living in the midst of the believers pretending to be believers and wishing for the worst to come upon the real believers. In order to separate the wheat from the chaff, Allah decreed the calamity in the Battle of Uhud; so the hypocrites could be told apart. [87] The unseen here was informing the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) about the real hypocrites so that he may be on guard against them. . [88] Abu Hurayrah (رضي الله عنه) reported that Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) said: ""Anyone whom Allah has given wealth but he does not pay its Zakāt; then, on the Day of Resurrection, his wealth will be presented to him in the shape of a bald-headed poisonous male snake with two poisonous glands in its mouth and it will encircle itself round his neck and bite him over his cheeks and say, ‘I am your wealth; I am your treasure.’"" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) recited this divine verse. [Fath al-Bāri 4/11-13, Sahih al-Bukhāri: 88]."
3,181,184,"Verily God has heard the saying of those, namely the fews, who said, ‘Indeed God is poor, and we 
are rich’: they said this when the verse, who is he that will lend God a good loan [Q. 2:245] wa s revealed, 
adding that, ‘If God were [truly] rich. He would not be asking us for loans’. We shall write down. We shall 
order that it be written, what they have said, in the scrolls containing their deeds so that they will be 
requited for it (a variant reading [for adive naktubu, ‘We shall write’] has the passive yuktabu, ‘it shall be 
written) and. We shall write down, their slaying (read accusative qatlahum or nominative qatluhum) the 
prophets without right, and We shall say ( naqulu, also read yaqulu, meaning God [shall say]) to them by 
the tongue of the angels in the Hereafter, ‘Taile the chastisement of the Burning, the Fire. When they are thrown into [the Fire], it will be said to them: That, punishment, is for what 
your hands have sent before: ‘hands’ are used to designate a human being because moil adions are 
performed with them; for God is never unjuft towards His servants’, punishing them without them 
having sinned. Those ( alladhlna, an adjectival qualification of the previous alladhlna, ‘those who’ [Q. 3:181])

should not believe in any messenger, accepting his truthfulness, until he bring us an offering to be 
devoured by fire’, and so we will not believe in you until you bring us this [offering], namely, of grazing 
livestock or other [kind of animal] one offers [in sacrifice] to God. If it is accepted, a white fire will come 
down from the heaven and consume it, otherwise it will remain as it is. Such a covenant was made with 
the Children of Israel, but not in the case of Jesus and Muhammad. God, exalted be He, says, Say, to 
them in rebuke: ‘messengers have come to you before me with clear proofs, with miracles, and with that 
which you said, [messengers] such as Zachariah and John, but you slew them: the address here is for 
those living at the time of our Prophet Muhammad (s), even though the deed was their forefathers’, for 
they [their descendants] are content with it. Why did you slay them, then, if you are truthful?’, about 
[the fad:] that you would believe if it [the offering] were brought [to you]. But if they deny you, so were denied messengers before you who came bearing clear proofs, 
miracles, and the Scriptures, such as the scrolls of Abraham, and the Illuminating, the lucid. Book, that 
is, the Torah and the GoSJiel (a variant reading establishes the [prefixed preposition] ba in both [words, 
sc. bi’l-zubur wa-bi’l-kitab l-munir, ‘with the Scriptures and with the Illuminating Book’]), so be patient 
as they were.","Allah has heard the words of those who said, “Allah is poor and we are rich[89]!” We will write down what they said and their killing of the prophets unjustly, and We will say, “Taste the punishment of the burning Fire. . That is because of what your hands have sent forth, for Allah is not unjust to [His] slaves.” . They said, “Allah has commanded us not to believe in any messenger until he brings us an offering consumed by the fire.” Say, “There came to you messengers before me with clear proofs and with what you demanded. Then why did you kill them, if you are truthful?” . Then if they reject you [O Prophet], there were messengers who were rejected before you, who came with clear proofs, written ordinances [i.e., Psalms of David], and the enlightening Scripture.","[89] Al-Hasan al-Basrī reports that when the Jews of Madinah heard the previous verse, encouraging believers to spend in the way of Allah, they said: “If He asks people to spend in His way to achieve His goals, then He must be a wretched pauper!” [al-Tabarī, Ibn Kathīr, al-Qurtubī]"

Whoever is spared from the Fire and admitted into Paradise has truly won, for the life of this world is nothing but an illusory pleasure. . You will certainly be tested in your wealth and in yourselves, and you will certainly hear from those who were given the Scripture before you and from those who associate partners with Allah many abusive words.

the pledge [taken] from them in the Torah, ‘You shall expound it (read tubayyinunnahu, or yubayyinun-

not conceal if, or yaktumunahu, ‘they shall not conceal it’). But they rejected it, they discarded the cov¬ 
enant, behind their backs, and so they did not acft in accordance with it, and bought with it, they took 
in its place, a small price, of this world from the debased among them, enjoying supremacy over them 
in knowledge, and they concealed it, leSt it [the supremacy] escape them; how evil is what they have 
bought, [how evil is] this purchase of theirs! Do not reckon that (la tahsabanna, or read la yahsabanna, ‘let them not reckon) those who 
rejoice in what they have brought, that is, [in what] they have done by leading people astray, and who 
love to be praised for what they have not done, in the way of adherence to the truth, being [them¬ 
selves] misguided — do not reckon them (fa-la tahsabannahum, is for emphasis [in the case of both 
readings above]) secure, in a place where they can escape, from the chastisement, in the Hereafter; 
but instead they shall be in a place of wherein they shall be tortured, and that is Hell; there shall be 
a painful chastisement for them, in it (alim means mu’lim, ‘painful’). (If one reads yahsabanna, ‘let 
them [not] reckon, the two direcft objects of the firSt h-s-b verb would be indicated by the two direcft 
objecfts of the second h-s-b verb; but if one reads tahsabanna, ‘do [not] reckon’, then only second direcft 
objecft would be omitted). To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth, the storehouses of rain, sustenance, 
vegetation and so forth, and God has power over all things, including the punishing of disbelievers and 
the saving of believers.","And [remember] when Allah took a covenant from those who were given the Scripture, “that you should make it clear to people and not conceal it.” But they cast it behind their backs and sold it for a small price. How terrible is their deal! . Do not think of those who are delighted with their misdeeds and love to be praised for what they have not done[90]; so do not think that they will be safe from the punishment, and for them there will be a painful punishment. . To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth, and Allah is Most Capable of all things.","[90] Abu Sa‘īd al-Khudrī (رضي الله عنه) reported that the reason for the revelation of this verse was such that: “Some hypocrites at the time of the Prophet (ﷺ) would stay behind when he used to set out on forays, and they were pleased with this. Upon his return, they would forge excuses and swear to them. They even loved to be praised for what they did not do (i.e., being believers and part of the Prophet’s (ﷺ) army). Thus this verse was revealed”. [Al-Bukhārī: 4567, Muslim: 2777]"

the way of mercy and favour: they are asking Him that they be made among those that deserve such a

Sura Al ‘Imran And their Lord answers them, their supplication, by saying that, ‘I do not let the labour of any 
labourer among you go to watte, be you male or female — the one of you is as the other (this statement 
is a reaffirmation of the previous one): that is, they are both equal when it comes to recompensing them 
for their deeds and for not neglecfting them. When Umm Salama asked, ‘O Messenger of God, why is 
there no mention of women when it comes to the Emigration ( hijra)V ', the following was revealed: and 
those who emigrated, from Mecca to Medina, and were expelled from their habitations, those who 
suffered hurt in My way, for My religion, and fought, the disbelievers, and were slain (read qutilu or 
quttilu) — them I shall surely absolve of their evil deeds, concealing these with forgiveness, and I shall 
admit them to Gardens underneath which river flow’. A reward (thawaban is a verbal noun reaffirming 
the import of la-ukaffiranna) from God! (there is a shift of person here). And God — with Him is the 
fairett reward, [the fairest] requital.","Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and earth and the alternation of the night and day are signs for people of understanding, . those who remember Allah while standing, sitting, and lying on their sides, and reflect upon the creation of the heavens and earth [saying], “Our Lord, you have not created all this in vain. Glory be to You. Protect us from the punishment of the Fire. . Our Lord, whoever You cause to enter the Fire, You have surely disgraced him, and the wrongdoers will have no helpers. . Our Lord, we have heard the caller[91] to faith calling, ‘Believe in your Lord,’ so we believed. Our Lord, forgive us our sins, expiate our misdeeds, and cause us to die among the righteous. . “Our Lord, give us what You have promised us through Your messengers, and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection, for You never break Your promise.” . Their Lord responded to them: “I will never waste the deeds of any doer among you, male or female; you are the same in reward[92]. Those who migrated and were driven out of their homes and suffered for My sake, and fought and were killed – I will surely expiate their sins and admit them into gardens under which rivers flow, a reward from Allah; with Allah is the best reward.”",[91] Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). .

3,196,198,"When the Muslims began to say, ‘Look at the enemies of God, how comfortable they are, while 
we are struggling!’, the following was revealed: Let it not delude you, that the disbelievers go to and fro 
in the land, engaging in commerce and acquiring profit: That is [but], a little enjoyment, which they enjoy for a short while in this world and then per¬ 
ishes; then their abode is Hell — an evil cradling, [an evil] renting place it is! But those who fear their Lord —for them shall be Gardens underneath which rivers flow, abid¬

operator is the import of the adverbial phrase) from God Himself. That which is with God, in the way of 
reward, is better for the pious, than the enjoyment of this world.","Do not be deceived by the disbelievers’ prosperity in the land: . it is a brief enjoyment, then Hell will be their abode. What a terrible resting place! .

what has been revealed to them, that is, the Torah and the GoSJiel, humble before God ( khashiin is a 
circumstantial qualification of the person of [the verb] yumin, ‘who believe’, and takes into account the 
[potentially plural] sense of man, ‘who’), not purchasing with the verses of God, which they have before 
them in the Torah and the GoSJiel pertaining to the descriptions of the Prophet (s), a small price, of this 
world, by concealing them for fear of losing their supremacy, as others, like the Jews, have done. Those 
— their wage, the reward for their deeds, is with their Lord, [a reward] which they will be given twice 
over, as [Stated] in the surat al-Qasas [Q. 28:54]. God is swift at reckoning, reckoning with the whole of 
creation in about half a day of the days of this world. O you who believe, be patient, in [performing] acfts of obedience, in the face of afflicftions and in 
refraining from acfts of disobedience, and vie in patience, with the disbelievers, leSt they be more patient 
than you; be tteadfatt, persist in the Struggle; fear God, in all of your circumstances, so that you will

reached maturity, and do not exchange the evil, the unlawful, for the good, the lawful, that is, taking the 
one in place of the other, as you do when you take what is good from the orphans property, and leave him 
your faulty properly instead; and absorb not their property, [by] adding it, into your property; surely 
that, the absorbing of it, is a great crime, a serious sin. When this was revealed they found it difficult to 
maintain guardianship over orphans, and some of them had ten or eight wives under their care, and did 
not treat them all equally, and so the following was revealed: If you fear that you will not ad judly, [that] you will [not] be equitable, towards the orphans, and 
are thus distressed in this matter, then also fear left you be unjuft towards women when you marry them; 
marry such (ma means man ) women as seem good to you, two or three or four, that is, [each man may

have become eligible for it through puberty or [legal] age, which, according to al-Shafi‘1, is the comple¬ 
tion of fifteen years; then, if you perceive in them maturity, that is, right [judgement] in matters of reli¬ 
gion and their property, deliver their property to them; consume it not, O guardians, wailefidly, without 
due merit, and in haile, that is, hastening to expend it, fearing, left they should grow up, and become 
mature, at which time you will be obliged to hand it over to them. If any man, who is a guardian, is rich, 
let him be abstinent, that is, let him abstain from the orphan’s property and refrain from consuming it; if 
he is poor, let him consume, of it, honourably, that is, in line with the wage for his work. And when you 
deliver to them, the orphans, their property, take witnesses over them, that they have received it and that 
you are absolved [of the obligation], so that if any dilute occurs, you are able to refer to a clear proof: 
this is a command [intended] for guidance. God suffices as a reckoner, as a guardian of His creatures’ 
deeds and as a reckoner of these [deeds] (the ba [in bi’Llahi] is extra).","Give orphans their wealth, and do not exchange your bad possessions for their good ones, nor consume their wealth by mixing it with your own; for this is indeed a great sin. . If you fear that you may not maintain justice with orphan girls [by marrying them] then marry women of your choice – two, three, or four[3]; but if you fear that you may not maintain justice, then marry only one, or slave-girls you may own. That is more likely to avoid committing injustice. . Give women their marriage dowries[4] graciously. However, if they waive to you part of it willingly, then enjoy it with a clear conscience. . Do not give the feeble-minded your property, which Allah has made a means of livelihood for you, but feed and clothe them from it, and speak to them kindly. . Test the orphans until they reach a marriageable age. Then if you perceive maturity in them, hand over their property to them[5], and do not consume it extravagantly and hastily, lest they should grow up. If the guardian is well-off, he should restrain himself entirely; but if he is poor, he may take a reasonable provision. When you hand over their property to them, call in witnesses. And Allah is sufficient as a Reckoner.","[3] ‘Ā’ishah (رضي الله عنها) said: “This verse was revealed concerning any man under whom is an orphan girl for whom he is both guardian and inheritor, while she has money and with no one to argue in her favor. This guardian is enjoined not to marry her for her money, nor is he to beat or molest her in the process. In this respect, Allah says: “If you fear that you may not maintain justice with orphan girls [by marrying them] then marry women of your choice”. That is, He, the Almighty, is saying: “These I made lawful for you, and leave out those that you may be unfair to.”” [Al-Bukhārī: 4573, Muslim: 3018] . [4] The obligatory bridal gift (mahr). . [5] Test those orphans over whom you are guardian so as to make sure that they are discerning enough to be given their money and will not squander it due to lack of mental maturity."
4,7,10,"The following was revealed as a repudiation of pre-Islamic practices in which women and children 
were not given any inheritance: To the men, young ones and kin, belongs a share, a portion, of what, 
deceased, parents and kinsmen leave, and to the women belongs a share of what parents and kinsmen 
leave, whether it, the property, be little or much. God has made it, an obligatory share, apportioned, to 
be given to them. And when the division, of the inheritance, is attended by kinsmen, those of kinship who cannot 
inherit, and orphans and the poor, grant them, something, out of it, before the division [is effected]; 
and, if the inheritors are young, ffieak to them, O guardians, honourable words, kindly, by apologising 
to them that it is not your possession [to divide as you wish], but that it is for the young [inheritors]. 2 
Some say that this [Stipulation] was abrogated; others say that it was not, only that people were all too 
readily negledting it, since it was encouraged [but not prescribed]. According to Ibn ‘Abbas, however, it 
is a duty. And let them fear, let them be concerned for the orphans, those who, if they, are about to, leave be¬ 
hind them, that is, after their death, weak offspring, young children, would be afraid for them; that they 
be ruined; let them fear God, in the matter concerning orphans, and let them give what they would love 
for their own offering after their death; and fpeak, to the one approached by death, pertinent words, the 
right [words], by enjoining him to give as voluntary almsgiving no more than the third [of the inherit¬ 
ance], and leave the remainder for the ones inheriting, so that they do not end up as dependants. Those who consume the property of orphans unjustly, without any right, are only consuming, the 
whole of it ns, fire in their bellies, because that is where such [adtion] leads, and they shall be exposed 
to (read adtive yaslawna, or passive yuslawna), that is, they shall enter, a blaze, an intense fire, in which 
they shall burn.","Men have a share in what parents and relatives leave behind, and women have a share in what parents and relatives leave behind, whether it is little or much; an ordained share[6]. . If at the time of distribution, [other] relatives, orphans, and the needy are present, give them something too[7], and speak to them kindly. . And let those [in charge of orphans] be cautious just as they themselves would be concerned had they left helpless offspring behind; let them fear Allah and say words of justice. . Indeed, those who consume the orphans’ property unjustly, only consume fire into their bellies[8], and they will burn in a Blazing Fire.","[6] This ‘ordained share’ is detailed in verse 11-12 below. . [7] Those who have no share in the inheritance. . [8] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Beware of the seven most cardinal sins: And among them he mentioned consuming an orphan’s property”. [Al-Bukhārī, 6857; Muslim, 89]"
4,11,12,"God charges you, He commands you, concerning, the matter of, your children, with what He will 
mention: to the male, of them, the equivalent of the portion, the lot, of two females, if there are two 
[women] with him, so that half the property is his, and the other half is theirs; if there is only one female 
with him, then she has a third, and he receives two thirds; if he is the only one, he takes it all; and if 
they, the offering, be, only, women more than two, then for them two-thirds of what he, the deceased, 
leaves; likewise if they be two women, since in the case of two sifters, more deserving of such a share, 
God says, They shall receive two-thirds of what he leaves [Q. 4:176]; and since a female is entitled to a third 
with a male, she is all the more deserving [of the same share] with a female. It is said that fawq, ‘more 
than’, introduces a relative clause; it is also said to guard against the wrong impression that the greater 
the number [of females] the greater the portion [they are entitled to], since, it is [mistakenly] thought 
that the entitlement of two females to two-thirds derives from the fadt that a female is entitled to one 
third when with a male; but if she, the daughter, be one ( wahidatan, is also read wahidatun, making the 
kdna [cons'trudtion] syntadtically complete) then to her a half; and to his parents, the deceased’s, to each 
one of the two ( li-kulli wahidin minhumd, substitutes for the previous li-abawayhi, ‘to his parents’) the

sixth of what he leaves, if he has a child, male or female: the point of the substitution is to show that 
they do not share the sixth [but receive one each]. [The term] ‘child’ ( walad ) also applies to a grandchild, 
and likewise ‘parent’ (abb) to a grandparent; but if he has no child, and his heirs are his parents, alone 
or along with a Spouse, then to his mother (read li-ummihi; also read, in both places [here and further 
down], li-immihi in order to avoid the cumbersome transition from a damma [‘u’] to a kasra [‘I’]) a third, 
of the property, or what remains after the Spouse, the rest being for the father; or, if he has siblings, two 
or more, males or females, to his mother a sixth, and the reft for the father, and nothing for the siblings. 
The inheritance Stipulated for those mentioned shall take place, after, the fulfilment of, any bequest that 
he may bequeath (read acftive yiisi, or passive yusa), or, the repayment of, any debt, that he may owe. 
‘BequeSt’ comes before ‘debt’, even though it should only be fulfilled after the latter [has been repayed], 
to show that it should be taken seriously. Your parents and children (abaukum wa-abnaukum, is the 
subject, its predicate being [what follows]) — you know not which of them is nearer in benefit to you, 
in this world and the Hereafter. It may be that one supposes his son to be beneficial to him, leaves him 
an inheritance, and then it turns out that the father had been the more beneficial [of the two], and vice 
versa. The only One with knowledge of this [reality] is God, and for this reason He has prescribed for you 
inheritance: a prescription from God; surely God is ever Knowing, of His creation. Wise, in what He has 
ordained for them, that is to say, He is ever possessed of such attributes. And for you a half of what your wives leave, if they have no children, from you or from another; 
but if they have children, then for you a fourth of what they leave, after any bequest they may bequeath, 
or any debt-, the consensus is that the grandchild in this case is like the child. And for them, the wives, 
whether one or more, a fourth of what you leave, if you have no children; but if you have children, from 
them or from others, then for them an eighth of what you leave, after any bequest you may bequeath, or 
any debt; again the consensus is that the grandchild is as the child. If it be a man leaving an inheritance 
(yurathu, ‘being inherited from’, is an adjecftival qualification, the predicate of which is [the following 
kalalatan, ‘without direcft heir’]) and not having a direct heir, that is, [having] neither a parent nor child, 
or it be a woman, leaving an inheritance and having no direcft heir, but it be that such, a man leaving an 
inheritance with no direcft heir, has a brother or a sifter, from the same mother, as read by Ibn Mas'ud 
and others, then to each of the two a sixth, of what he leaves; but if they, the siblings from the same 
mother, be more than that, that is, [more] than one, then they share a third, the male and female equally, 
after any bequeft to be bequeathed or any debt without prejudice ( ghayra mudarrin, is a circumstantial 
qualifier referring to the person governing [the verb] yusa, ‘to be bequeathed’) in other words, without 
causing any prejudice to the inheritors by bequeathing more than the third); a charge ( wasiyyatan, a ver¬ 
bal noun reaffirming [the import of] yusikum, ‘He charges you’ [of the beginning of the previous verse])

deferring the punishment of those that disobey Him. The Sunna Specifies that the individuals mentioned 
may receive the relevant inheritance provided that they are not barred from it on account of their having 
committed murder, or [their belonging to] a different religion or being slaves. 

[4:13 ] Those, rulings mentioned with reSJjecft to orphans and what followed, are God’s bounds. His laws, 
which He has delimited for His servants, so that they may acft in accordance with them and not infringe 
them. Whoever obeys God and His Messenger, in what He has ruled, He will admit him (yudkhilhu, or, 
as a shift [to the firft person plural] read nudkhilhu, ‘We will admit him’) to Gardens underneath which 
rivers flow, abiding therein; that is the great triumph.","Allah instructs you concerning [the inheritance of] your children: the share of a male is equal to that of two females. If there are only daughters, two or more, they get two-thirds of the estate, but if there is only one daughter, she gets half. Each parent is entitled to one-sixth if he left offspring, but if he left no offspring and the parents are the only heirs, the mother gets one-third, but if he has siblings, the mother gets one-sixth, after settling any bequests or debts[9]. Your parents and your children, you do not know which of them will benefit you more. [These shares are] ordained by Allah; and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. . Your share is half of your wives’ estate if they leave no child; but if they leave a child, you get one-fourth, after settling the bequests or debts. Your wives’ share is one-fourth of your estate if you leave no child, but if you leave a child, they get one-eighth, after settling the bequests or debts. If a man or a woman leaves neither parents nor offspring[10], but has a brother or a sister, each one gets one-sixth[11]; but if they are more than two, they share in one-third, after settling the bequests or debts, without causing harm to the heirs. This is an instruction from Allah; and Allah is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing.","[9] Based upon prophetic Hadīths, scholars have ruled that debt takes precedence over a bequest, that a bequest should not include anyone who inherit by law, and that the total bequest should not be more than one third of the estate. After the fulfillment of debts and bequests (if any), the remainder of the estate is to be divided. .

was appointed for them through [the stipulation] that the virgin should receive a hundred lashes and be 
banished for a year, and the married woman be Stoned. The prescribed punishment was explained thus 
in the hadith, ‘Come listen to me! Come listen to me! God has now made a way out for them’, as reported 
by Muslim. And when two of you (read wa’lladhani or wa’lladhanni) men, commit it, that is, a lewd a<ft, adul¬ 
tery or homosexual intercourse, punish them both, with insults and beatings with sandals; but if they 
repent, of this [lewd acft], and make amends, through [good] acftion, then leave them be, and do not 
harm them. God ever turns [relenting], to those who repent, and is Merciful, to them. This [verse] is ab¬ 
rogated by the prescribed punishment if adultery is meant [by the lewd acft], and similarly if homosexual 
intercourse is meant, according to al-Shafi'i; but according to him, the person who is the objecft of the 
[penetrative] acft is not atoned, even if he be married; rather, he is flogged and banished. Judging by the 
dual person pronoun, it seems more obvious that homosexual fornication is meant [by this verse], even 
though the former [sc. al-Shafi'i] was of the opinion that it referred to an adulterer and an adulteress; but 
this [opinion of his] may be countered by the facft that [the reference to] the two [men] becomes clear on 
account of the particle min being attached to a masculine pronoun [minkum, ‘of you’], and by the facft 
that they suffer the same punishment, [both effecft the acftion of] repentance and [are both granted] that 
they be left alone [thereafter], [all of] which applies Specifically to men, given that for women detention 
is stipulated, as was Stated before.","Those of your women who commit adultery, call four witnesses against them[12] from amongst you. If they testify, confine them to their homes until they die or Allah ordains for them [another] way[13]. . If two among you commit this [sin], chastise them. Then if they repent and mend their ways, leave them alone[14]. Indeed, Allah is Accepting of Repentance, Most Merciful.","[12] The witnesses must swear to actually having seen the act taking place.
 [13] The provision of this verse has been abrogated by the verse of Surat an-Nūr (24:2), ordaining lashing for the unmarried and stoning to death for the married. . [14] Scholars differed over whether ""the two"" refers to two of the same sex (i.e., homosexuals) or those of opposite sexes. In either case, later rulings outlined in the Sunnah have replaced this one."
4,17,18,"The repentance that God accepts, that is, the one which He has prescribed for Himself to accept, 
out of His bounty, is only of those who do evil, an acft of disobedience, in ignorance (bi-jahalatin, a 
circumstantial qualifier, in other words, ‘they are ignorant’ while they are disobeying their Lord); then 
repent shortly thereafter, before the laSt gaSps of death; God will relent to those. He will accept their 
repentance. And God is ever Knowing, of His creatures, Wise, in what He does with them. Repentance is not for those who do evil deeds, sins, until, when death approaches one of them, 
and the pangs of death begin, he says, upon witnessing his predicament: ‘Indeed now I repent’, for this 
would not avail him and would not be accepted from him; neither for those who die disbelieving, if they 
repent in the Hereafter upon seeing the chastisement: it will not be accepted from them. Those — We 
have prepared for them a painful chastisement.","Allah only accepts the repentance of those who commit evil out of ignorance, then repent soon thereafter[15]; it is they to whom Allah will turn in forgiveness, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. . However, repentance is not for those who commit evil deeds until death approaches one of them, he then says, “Now I repent,” nor for those who die as disbelievers; for them We have prepared a painful punishment.",[15] Before seeing death with his own eyes.
4,19,21,"Oyou who believe, it is not lawful for you to inherit women againSt their will (read either karhan 
or kurhan, as alternative forms) that is to say, coercing them into this. In pre-Islamic times, they used 
to inherit women from their kin, and if they so wished they could marry [a woman] without a dowry, 
or marry her off and take the dowry for themselves, or prevent her [from marriage] until she gave up 
what she had inherited, or until she died and they could inherit from her. They were thus forbidden such 
practices; neither debar them, your [former] wives from marrying others by retaining them while you 
have no desire for them yourselves, only to harm them; so that you may go off with part of what you 
have given them, of the dowry, except when they commit flagrant (read mubayyina, ‘making it clear’, or 
mubayyana, ‘clear’) lewdness, such as adultery or rebellion, then you have the right to coerce them until 
they redeem themselves to you or forfeit [their dowries]. Consort with them in kindness, that is, being 
decent in peaking [to them], with regard to [their] expenditure and lodging; for if you hate them, then 
be patient; it may happen that you hate a thing wherein God has set much good, that is to say, perhaps 
He does this when He provides you with a righteous child through them. And if you desire to exchange a wife in place of another, by divorcing the one, and you have given 
to one, of the Rouses, a hundredweight, that is, a large sum as dowry, take of it nothing. Would you take 
it by way of calumny, injustice, and manifest sin? (buhtanan, ‘calumny’, and ithman, ‘sin, end in the ac¬ 
cusative because they are circumstantial qualifiers); the interrogative here is meant as a rebuke, and as a 
disavowal where He says: How shall you take it, that is, by what right, when each of you has been privily with the other, 
through sexual intercourse, which validates the dowry, and they have taken from you a solemn cov¬ 
enant, a binding pledge, and that is what God commanded, namely, that they should be retained hon¬ 
ourably or set free virtuously.

of you is as the other, being equal in religion, so do not disdain to marry with them. So marry them, 
with the permission of their folk, their guardians, and give them their wages, their dowries, honourably, 
without procrastination or diminution, as women in wedlock ( muhsanat, a circumstantial qualifier), in 
decency, not illicitly, openly fornicating, or taking lovers, companions fornicating in secret. But when 
they are given in wedlock, [when] they are married off (a variant reading [for the passive uhsinna, ‘they 
are given in wedlock’] has the aCtive ahsanna, ‘they enter into wedlock’), if they commit lewdness, such 
as adultery, they shall be liable to half the chaftisement, the legal punishment, of married, free, virgin, 
women, who commit adultery, and are thus given fifty lashes and banished for half a year; [male] slaves 
by analogy are liable to the same punishment. Here, God has not made wedlock the precondition for the 
prescribed punishment to show that Stoning does not apply in their case [sc. slavegirls]. That, marrying

of slavegirls on account of insufficient means, is for those of you who fear the distress of sin, fornication 
( al-‘anat originally means distress, but is used to mean zind, ‘fornication’, because of the distress that it 
causes in the way of the punishment in this world and in the Hereafter), as opposed to those of you who 
might not have such a fear [of distress] with regard to their free women and for whom it is unlawful to 
marry her [the slavegirl]; likewise for one who has sufficient means to marry a free woman [it is unlawful 
for him to marry a slavegirl instead]: this is the opinion of al-Shafi‘I. Moreover, God’s words ‘believing 
maids’ precludes unbelieving women, whom it is unlawful to marry, even if one should find no believ¬ 
ing women and fear [the distress of fornication]; yet it is better for you to be patient, and abstain from 
marrying slavegirls, lekt the child should become enslaved also. God is Forgiving, Merciful, by allowing 
room for manoeuvre in these matters.","But if any of you cannot afford to marry free believing women, you may marry believing bondwomen in your possession. Allah knows best about your faith; you are from one another. Marry them with the permission of their masters and give them their dowries in fairness – provided that they are chaste, neither given to committing fornication nor having secret paramours. If they commit adultery after marriage, they are liable to half of the punishment prescribed for free women[18]. This is for those of you who fear falling into sin; but if you stay patient, it is better for you. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",[18] Their punishment is fifty (50) lashes; neither stoning to death nor exile.
4,26,28,"God desires to make clear to you, the laws of your religion and what is in your be it interests, and 
to guide you in the ways, the paths, of those, prophets, before you, in the way of what is lawful and what 
is unlawful, so that you might follow them, and to turn [in forgiveness] towards you, bringing you back 
from the disobedience which you practised, to obedience to Him; God is Knowing, of you, Wise, in what 
He has ordained for you. And God desires to turn [forgivingly] towards you (He repeats this in order to expand upon it), 
but those who follow their passions, the Jews and Christians, or the Magians and adulterers, desire that 
you deviate with a terrible deviation, transgressing what is right by committing what has been forbid¬ 
den you, so that you might be like them. God desires to lighten things for you, and make the rulings of the Law easier for you; for man was 
created weak, unable to abstain from women and passions.","Allah wants to make things clear to you and guide you to the [righteous] ways of those before you, and accept your repentance; and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. . Allah wants to accept your repentance, but those who follow their lusts want you to deviate a massive deviation. . Allah wants to lighten your burdens, for man was created weak.",

consume. And kill not yourselves, by committing what leads towards destruction on account of some 
affiliation, be it in this world or the Hereafter. Surely God is ever Merciful to you, when He forbids you 
such things. And whoever does that, which he has been forbidden, through aggression (' udwanan, a circum¬ 
stantial qualifier), transgressing what is lawful, and injustice ( zulman, [reiterated] for emphasis), him We 
shall certainly expose, admit, to afire, wherein he shall burn; and that for God is an easy matter.","O you who believe, do not consume one another’s property unlawfully, unless it is trade conducted with your mutual consent.

been prescribed, like murder, fornication or theft — according to Ibn ‘Abbas, these number as much as 
seven hundred — We will absolve you of your, minor, evil deeds, on account of your acfts of obedience, 
and admit you by an honourable gate (read mudkhalan or madkhalan ), that is, [by an honourable] ad¬

Paradise.","If you avoid the major sins[20] which are forbidden to you, We will absolve your [minor] sins and admit you to a noble entrance.","[20] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ""Avoid the seven great destructive sins."" They asked, ""O Allah’s Messenger! What are they?"" He said, ""(1) To associate partners with Allah, (2) sorcery; (3) to kill a person whom Allah has forbidden except for a just cause; (4) to consume Ribā (usury); (5) to eat up the property of an orphan; (6) to turn one’s back to the enemy and fleeing from the battlefield at the time of fighting and (7) to accuse innocent chaste women of immorality.""

by way of being obedient to their Spouses and guarding their private parts: this was revealed when Umm 
Salama said: ‘Would that we were men, so that we could join the Struggle and receive the reward they 
receive!’ And ask (read wa-s’alu or wa-salu) God of His bounty, what you need and He will give it to you;

Men will have the reward of their deeds and women will have the reward of their deeds. And ask Allah for His bounty[21]. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of everything. . For everyone We have appointed heirs to what parents and close relatives leave behind. As for those to whom you have made a pledge, give them their share[22]. Indeed, Allah is Witness over all things.",[21] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Ask Allah while you firmly believe that He will respond to you; know that Allah does not respond to an inattentive and wandering heart”. [At-Tirmidhī: 3479] . [22] The majority of the scholars are of the opinion that the provision of this verse is abrogated by verse 8: 75.
4,34,35,"Men are in charge of, they have authority over, women, disciplining them and keeping them in 
check, because of that with which God has preferred the one over the other, that is, because God has 
given them the advantage over women, in knowledge, reason, authority and otherwise, and because of 
what they expend, on them [the women], of their property. Therefore righteous women, among them, 
are obedient, to their husbands, guarding in the unseen, that is, [guarding] their private parts and other¬ 
wise during their Rouses’ absence, because of what God has guarded, for them, when He enjoined their 
male Rouses to look after them well. And those you fear may be rebellious, disobedient to you, when 
such signs appear, admonish them, make them fear God, and share not beds with them, retire to other 
beds if they manifest such disobedience, and Strike them, but not violently, if they refuse to desist [from 
their rebellion] after leaving them [in separate beds]. If they then obey you, in what is desired from them, 
do not seek a way againSt them, a reason to strike them unjustly. God is ever High, Great, so beware of 
Him, left He punish you for treating them unjustly. And if you fear, become aware of, a breach, a dilute, between the two, the married couple (the 
genitive conftrucftion shiqdqa baynihima, ‘[any] breach between the two’, is for a range [of alternatives], 
in other words: shiqaqan baynihima [is the normal conftrucftion]) send forth, for them with their con¬

delegates to his arbiter the [matter of] divorce or the acceptance of compensation in its place, while she 
delegates to her arbiter the [matter of] separation. The two arbiters do their be,ft and bid the one guilty 
of the injuftice to desift, or they suggeft separation if they see fit. God, exalted be He, says, if they, the 
two arbiters, desire to set things right, God will grant them, the married couple, success, determining 
for them what conftitutes [an acft of] obedience, be it reconciliation or separation. Surely God is ever 
Knower, of everything, Aware, of what is hidden and what is manifefted.","Men are in charge of women, as Allah has made some of them excel the others, and because they spend of their wealth. Therefore the righteous women are obedient, and protect what Allah has entrusted them with[23] in [their husband’s] absence. As for those women on whose part you fear rebellion[24], [first] admonish them, [next] forsake them in bed, and [last] hit them[25]. Then if they obey you, do not take further action against them. Indeed, Allah is Most High, All-Great. . If you fear a breach between them, appoint an arbitrator from his family and another from hers.

4,36,40,"And worship God, declare His Oneness, and associate nothing with Him. Be kind to parents, 
being dutiful and gentle-mannered, and near kindred, and to orphans, and to the needy, and to the 
neighbour who is near, to you in terms of [physical] vicinity or kinship, and to the neighbour who is a 
Stranger, the one far from you in terms of [physical] vicinity or kinship; and to the friend at your side, a 
travelling companion, or a colleague at work, and, it is also said, one’s wife; and to the wayfarer, the one 
cut off during a journey, and to what your right hands own, of bondsmen. Surely God loves not the con¬ 
ceited, the arrogant, and the boastful, [the one who boafts] before people of what he has been given. Those ( alladhina, the subjecft) who are niggardly, in their duty, and bid other people to be nig¬ 
gardly, in the same, and conceal what God has bestowed upon them of His bounty, in the way of knowl¬ 
edge and property: these are the Jews (the predicate of the [said] subjecft is [an implied] lahum waidun 
shadid, ‘for them there is a promise of severe punishment’). And We have prepared for those that disbe¬ 
lieve, in this and other matters, a humbling chastisement, one of humiliation. And those ( wa’lladhina, a supplement to the previous alladhina, ‘those’) who expend of their sub¬ 
stance to show off to people, to be seen of them, and believe not in God and the LaSIDay, the likes of the 
hypocrites and the Meccans. Whoever has Satan for a comrade, for a companion, whose command he 
follows, as these do, then an evil comrade has he. And what burden is on them if they were to believe in God and the LaSt Day, and expend of 
what God has provided them?, that is to say, what harm would this cause them? In other words, there 
is no harm therein. Rather, harm lies in what they follow (the interrogative is meant as a disavowal; the 
law [of law dmanu, ‘if they were to believe’] conveys the sense of the verbal noun [sc. madha ‘alayhim 
imanuhum, ‘what burden would their belief be upon them?’]). God is ever Aware of them, and will re¬ 
quite them for what they have done. Surely God shall not wrong, anyone, so much as the weight of an atom, [the weight of] the small- 
eft ant, by diminishing thereby a person’s good deeds or increase thereby his evil deeds; and if it, the 
atom, be a good deed (in taku hasanatan, ‘if it be a good deed’, is also read in taku hasanatun, in which 
case the kana [conftrucftion] is [syntactically] complete), from a believer, He will double it (yudaifuha. 


78 


Sura al-Nisa 


also read yuda’ifuha), from ten times up to more than seven hundred times, and give from Himself, in 
addition to the doubling, a great wage, that no one can estimate.","Worship Allah and do not associate any partners with Him. Be kind to parents, relatives, orphans, the needy, near and distant neighbors, close friends, wayfarers, and slaves whom you own[26]. For Allah does not like those who are arrogant, boastful, . those who are stingy and promote stinginess among people[27], and conceal what Allah has bestowed upon them of His bounty. We have prepared for disbelievers a humiliating punishment. . And [also] those who spend their wealth to show off to people, but do not believe in Allah or the Last Day. Whoever[28] takes Satan as an associate has indeed taken an evil associate. . What harm would it do to them to believe in Allah and the Last Day, and spend out of what Allah has provided for them? For Allah is All-Knowing of them. . Allah does not do injustice as much as an atom’s weight[29]. And if it is a good deed, He will multiply it and give from Himself a great reward.","[26] This is known as the verse of the Ten Rights (al-huqūq al-‘ashrah). . [27] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ""Everyday two angels come down from heaven; one of them says, ‘O Allah! Compensate every person who spends in Your cause,’ and the other says, ‘O Allah! Destroy every miser.’"" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 522] . [28] They are the companions of Satan, who enjoins ungodly acts and drives them away from acts of virtue. .

4,41,42,"So how shall it be, the predicament of the disbelievers, when We bring forward from every com¬ 
munity a witness, to testify against it regarding its deeds, and this shall be its prophet; and We bring you, 
O Muhammad (s), as witness against these? Upon that day, the day of bringing forward; the disbelievers, those who have disobeyed the Mes¬ 
senger, will wish that (law, ‘if’, means an, ‘that’) the earth might be levelled with them (read passive 
tusawwd, or adive tasawwa, or tassawwa), so that like it they might also become dud, [and this is] be¬ 
cause of the terror of that day, as is dated in another verse: The disbeliever shall say, ‘O would that I were 
duttl’ [Q. 78:40]. And they will not hide from God any talk, of what they did, although at another dage 
they do actually hide it and say, ‘By God, our Lord, we never associated anything with You’ [Q. 6:23].","How will it be when We bring a witness from every community, and bring you [O Prophet] as a witness against these [people]? . On that Day, those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that the earth were leveled upon them. And they will not be able to hide anything from Allah[30].",[30] Because they know that they will be held accountable for all their past deeds and they can say nothing but the truth on that Day.

that is, [unless] you are travelling — until you have washed yourselves, in which case you may perform 
prayer: a proviso is made for the traveller because a different dipulation applies to him, as will follow. It 
is said that the purpose [of this verse] is to prohibit the approach to places of prayer, that is, mosques, 
the exception being if one were merely passing through and not daying. But if you are sick, with an 
illness made worse by [contact with] water, or on a journey, that is, [or] travelling whild you are [ritu¬ 
ally] defiled or impure, or if any of you comes from the privy ( al-ghait ), a place designated for relieving

reading has lamatlum: both mean lams, that is, ‘touching with the hand’, as dated by Ibn ‘Umar; 3 this is 
also the opinion of al-Shafi‘I, and it extends to touching with other parts of the skin; according to Ibn 
‘Abbas, however, it is [referring to] sexual intercourse); and you can find no water, with which to purify 
yourselves for prayer, having made the effort to seek it out and search for it — the sick being exempt in 
this case — then resort to, seek, when the time [for the prayer] has commenced, wholesome soil, clean 
earth, drike it twice, and wipe your faces and your hands, with it, up to the elbows (the verb masaha, 
‘to wipe’, may dand on its own with a direcft objedt or take a particle [before the diredt objedt, sc. masaha 
bi-]).

May you never hear,” and “Rā‘ina,” [i.e., hearken to us][32] – twisting their tongues and insulting the religion. If they had said, “We hear and obey,” and “Hear,” and “Wait for us,” it would have been better for them and more proper. But Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so only a few of them will believe.",[32] Some of the Madinan Jews used to address the Prophet (ﷺ) by subtly twisting their tongues when uttering rā‘inā to mean: “You are foolish!”

by transforming them into apes, as We cursed, [as] We transformed, those of the Sabbath, among them, 
and God’s command, His decree, is done: after this was revealed, ‘Abd Allah b. Salam converted to Islam, 
and so it was said that this had been a conditional threat of punishment, so that when some of them 
converted to Islam, it [the threat] was lilted. It is also said that obliteration and transformation will take 
place before the rising of the Hour. God forgives not that anything should be associated with Him. But He forgives other than, save, 
that, of sins, to whomever He wills, forgiveness for, by admitting him into Paradise without punishment. 
And whomever He wills of the believers He punishes for their sins, and then admits them into Paradise. 
Whoever associates anything with God, then he has indeed invented a tremendous, a great, sin.","O you who were given the Scripture, believe in what We have sent down [to Muhammad] – confirming your own Scriptures – before We obliterate faces turning them backward, or We curse them[33] as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers. For Allah’s will is always executed. . Allah does not forgive associating partners with Him[34], but forgives anything less than that for whom He wills. Whoever associates partners with Allah has indeed committed a grave sin.","[33] This verse is a severe warning to the Jews and Christians that they must believe in Allah’s Messenger Muhammad (ﷺ) and in this Qur’an. . [34] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ""Allah will say to that person of the Hellfire who will receive the least punishment, ‘If you had everything on the earth, would you give it as a ransom to free yourself?’ He will say, `Yes’.

Jews, when they came to Mecca and saw those killed at Badr, and began to incite the idolaters to avenge 
them [their dead] by waging war against the Prophet (s): Have you not seen those who were given a 
share of the Book, how they believe in al-Jibt and al-Taghut, two idols belonging to Quraysh, and say 
to the disbelievers, to Abu Sufyan and his companions, when they [the latter] said to them: Are we, who 
are the guardians of the House, who give drink to the pilgrim, offer hospitality to the gueSt, set free the 
captive, and do such and such ... not more rightly guided than Muhammad, he who has contravened the 
religion of his forefathers, severed the ties of kinship, and abandoned the Sancftuary?’, ‘These, in other 
words, you, are more rightly guided, upon a more upright way, than the believers’? Those are the ones whom God has cursed; and he whom God has cursed, you will never find for 
him any helper, anyone to p rot eft him from His chastisement. 

[4:5 3] Or have they a share in the Kingdom?, that is to say, they have no share in it whatever, and even if 
they did, then they would not give the people a single date-Spot, that is, [not even] something as worth¬ 
less as the tiny Spot on the back of a date-pit, because of the extent of their niggardliness.  Or, nay, are they jealous of people, namely, of the Prophet ( s),for the bounty that God has be¬ 
stowed upon them, in the way of prophethood and abundance of women? In other words, they wish 
that he be deprived of such things, saying, ‘If he were truly a prophet, he would not be concerned with 
women. For We gave the House of Abraham, his forefather, the likes of Moses, David and Solomon, the 
Book and wisdom, and prophethood, and We gave them a mighty kingdom: David had ninety-nine 
women, and Solomon had a thousand, free women and slavegirls. And there are some of them who believe in him, in Muhammad (s), and some of them who bar 
from him, [who] rejeft [him] and do not believe. Hell suffices for a blaze, as a chastisement for those

Aren’t you?” He replied: “Yes!” They then said: “What do you think of this sonless outcast (meaning Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) claiming that he is better than us when we are the custodians of pilgrims and the caretakers of the House of Allah!” He said: “You are indeed better than him!” Then the following verses were revealed: “Indeed, your hater is the one cut off”, (108: 3) and (5: 51- 52)”.

4,58,59,"Verily, God commands you to restore trusts, that is, the rights entrusted [to you by others], back 
to their owners-, this was revealed when ‘All, may God be pleased with him, took the key of the Ka'ba 
from its keeper, ‘Uthman b. Talha al-Hajabl, 4 by force, upon the arrival of the Prophet (s) in Mecca in the 
year of the ConqueSt, after he [‘Uthman] had tried to prevent him [‘All from taking it] saying, ‘If I had 
known that he was the Messenger of God, I would not have prevented him’. The Messenger of God (s) 
then ordered him [‘All] to give it back to him [‘Uthman] saying to him, ‘Here you are, [it is yours] now 
and always’. He [‘Uthman] was amazed by this, whereupon ‘All recited to him this verse, and he accepted 
Islam. Upon his death, he [‘Uthman] gave it [the key] to his brother, Shayba, and thus it remained in [the 
keep of] his descendants. Although the verse was revealed regarding a ^ecific occasion, it holds true in 
general on account of the plural person [to which it is addressed]. And when you judge between people. 
He commands, that you judge with justice. Excellent is (niimma, the mim of mima has been assimilated 
with the indefinite particle ma, which is the objecft described, in other words, naima shay’an, ‘an excel¬ 
lent thing [is]’) the admonition God gives you, to restore a trust and to judge with justice. God is ever 
Hearer, of what is said, Seer, of what is done. Oyou who believe, obey God, and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you, that is, 
rulers, when they command you to obey God and His Messenger. If you should quarrel, disagree, about 
anything, refer it to God, that is, to His Book, and the Messenger, while he lives, and thereafter [refer] to 
his Sunna: in other words examine these [dilutes] with reference to these two [sources], if you believe 
in God and the LaSIDay; that, reference to the two [sources], is better, for you than quarrelling or [ad¬ 
hering to] personal opinions, and more excellent in interpretation, in the end.","Indeed, Allah commands you to return trusts to their owners, and when you judge between people, judge with justice. What an excellent exhortation from Allah to you! Indeed, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing. . O you who believe, obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and those of you who are in authority[44]. If you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day; that is better and more commendable in the end.",[44] Believers are told to obey those in charge of their affairs given that it should be in accordance with the Qur’an and Sunnah. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “No one should be obeyed in sinning against the Creator. Obeying only applies to what is deemed acceptable”. [Muslim: 1840]
4,60,63,"The following verse was revealed when a Jew and a hypocrite fell into a dilute. The hypocrite 
called on Ka'b b. al-Ashraf, to arbitrate between them, while the Jew called on the Prophet (s). When 
they came to him, the Prophet ruled in favour of the Jew. But the hypocrite was not satisfied, and so they 
went before ‘Umar. The Jew told him what had happened, whereupon he [‘Umar] turned to the hypo¬ 
crite and asked him, ‘Is this true?’ and when he replied, ‘Yes’, he [‘Umar] killed him. Have you not seen 
those who claim that they believe in what has been revealed to you, and what was revealed before you, 
desiring to take their disputes to a false deity (taghut ), one excessive in tempting [others] to falsehood 
(tughyan ), namely, Ka'b b. al-Ashraf, when they have been commanded to renounce him?, and not to 
associate with him. But Satan desires to mislead them, far aStray, from the truth. And when it is said to them, ‘Come to what God has revealed, as regards rulings in the Qur’an, 
and the Messenger’, that he may judge between you, you see the hypocrites turn away from you vehe¬ 
mently, to others. How would it be, [what] would they do, when an affliction, a punishment, befalls them for what 
their own hands have sent before them, of unbelief and acfts of disobedience, that is to say, would they 
then be able to turn away and escape it? No! They then come to you (thumma jauka, a supplement to 
yasuddun, ‘they turn away’ [of the previous verse]), swearing by God that, in turning to other than you 
for arbitration, ‘We sought only virtue, settlement, and harmony’, reconciliation between the diluting 
parties by [any] approximate judgement without regard for the painful truth.

father and uncle were killed fighting on the side of the Meccans at Uhud. ‘Uthman himself, however, later emigrated to join the 
Prophet at Medina with two other notables, ‘Amr b. al-‘As and Khalid b. al-Walid at the time of the Treaty of Hudaybiyya. He

Satan wants to lead them far astray. . When it is said to them, “Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger,” you will see the hypocrites turn away from you in aversion. . How will it be when a disaster befalls them because of what their hands have sent forth, then they come to you swearing by Allah, “We intended nothing but good and reconciliation.” . They are those whom Allah knows what is in their hearts; so turn away from them[48], admonish them, and speak to them in a far-reaching effective way.","[45] i.e., the hypocrites.

4,64,65,"We never sent any Messenger, but that he should be obeyed, in what he commands and judges, by 
the leave, by the command, of God, and not that he should be disobeyed or opposed. If, when they had 
wronged themselves, by seeking the judgement of the false idol, they had come to you, repentant, and 
asked forgiveness from God, and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them (there is a shift from 
the second [to the third] person in this address, in deference to his [the Prophet’s (s)] status); they woidd 
have found God Relenting, to them, Merciful, to them. But no, (fa-la, the la is extra) by your Lord! They will not believe until they make you judge over 
what has broken out, has become mixed up, between them and find in themselves no inhibition, [no] 
constraint or doubt, regarding what you decide, but submit, [but] comply with your ruling, in full sub¬ 
mission, without objection.","We did not send any Messenger but to be obeyed by Allah’s permission. If only they had come to you [O Prophet] – after wronging themselves – and had asked Allah for forgiveness, and the Messenger had asked for forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah Accepting of Repentance, Most Merciful. . But no, by your Lord, they will not believe until they accept you [O Prophet] as judge in their disputes, and find no discomfort within their hearts about your judgments, but accept them wholeheartedly.",
4,66,70,"And had We prescribed for them: (the particle an, ‘that’, is explicative) ‘Slay yourselves’ or ‘Leave 
your habitations’, as We did for the Children of Israel, they woidd not have done it, that is, what has 
been prescribed for them, save a few (read nominative qalilun, as a substitution; or read accusative 
qalilan, as an exceptive clause) of them; yet if they had done what they were admonished to do, of obedi¬ 
ence to the Messenger (s), it would have been better for them, and Stronger in establishing, [a Stronger] 
confirmation of their faith. And then, that is, had they confirmed themselves, We would have surely given them from Us a 
great wage, that is, Paradise. And We would have guided them to a Straight path. Some Companions said to the Prophet (s): 
‘How will we be able to see you in Paradise, when you will be in the highest Stations and we will be lower 
than you?’, and so the following was revealed: Whoever obeys God and the Messenger, in what he commands, they are with those whom God 
has blessed of the prophets and the truthful, that is, the moSt excellent of the Prophet’s Companions, be¬ 
cause of the fullness of their truthfulness and their affirmation of the truth; and the martyrs, those slain 
in the path of God; and the righteous, [all those] other than the ones mentioned. What fine companions 
they are!, in Paradise, since in it one will enjoy seeing them, visiting them and being in their presence, 
even though they will be in the highest Stations in relation to others. That, namely, their being with those mentioned ( dhalika, ‘that’, is the subject, the predicate of 
which is [the following]) is bounty from God, with which He has favoured them, and not because they 
have earned it through their obedience. God suffices as Knower, of the reward of the Hereafter, in other 
words, truSt in what He has told you: None can tell you like One Who is aware [Q. 35:14].","If We were to command them, “Kill yourselves”, or “Leave your homes”, they would not do it except for a few of them. But if they did what they were instructed, it would surely be better for them and more reassuring[49], . and then We would certainly give them from Us a great reward, . and would surely guide them to a straight path. . Those who obey Allah and the Messenger will be with those whom Allah has blessed: the prophets, the people of Truth, the martyrs, and the righteous[50]. What excellent companions they are! . That grace is from Allah, and sufficient is Allah as Knower.","[49] Faith (Imān) increases with obedience and decreases with rebelliousness. . [50] Al-Siddiqīn (the people of the Truth): They realized the Truth and confirmed it with their hearts, and embodied it with words and actions.

lant againSt him; then move forward, prepare to fight him, in companies, in separate groups, one raiding 
party followed by the next; or move forward all together, in one assembly. Verily, there are some of you who tarry, who indeed hesitate to join the fighting, such as ‘Abd 
Allah b. Ubayy, the hypocrite, and his companions — counting him [the one who tarries] as one of them 
[the Muslims] is from the perspective of outward appearances — (the lam in the verb [la-yubatti’anna,

There are some[51] among you who lag behind [from the battle]; then if a calamity befalls you, he will say, “Allah has blessed me that I was not present with them.” .

4,74,76,"God, exalted be He, says: So let them fight in the way of God, to elevate His religion, those who sell 
the life of this world for the Hereafter; and whoever fights in the way of God and is slain, dies a martyr, 
or conquers, overcomes his enemy, We shall give him a great wage, a plentiful reward. What is wrong with you, that you do not fight: this is an interrogative of rebuke, in other words, 
there is nothing to prevent you from fighting, in the way of God, and for, the deliverance of, the op¬ 
pressed men, women, and children, whom the disbelievers persecuted and prevented from emigrating. 
Ibn ‘Abbas, may God be pleased with him and his father, said, ‘My mother and I were among them’; 
who say, supplicating, ‘O, our Lord, bring us forth from this town, Mecca, whose people are evildoers, 
through unbelief, and appoint for us a protestor from You, to take charge of our affair, and appoint for 
us from You a helper’, to defend us against them. God responded to their supplication and facilitated 
escape for some of them, while others remained behind until Mecca was conquered — in charge of them 
the Prophet (s) placed ‘Attab b. Asid, who proceeded to seek justice for the wronged from those that had 
wronged them. 5 Those who believe fight in the way of God, and those who disbelieve fight in the way of a false de¬ 
ity, Satan. Fight therefore again & the friends of Satan, the supporters of his religion and you will defeat 
them with the strength you draw from God; surely the plotting of Satan, against believers, is ever feeble, 
of no substance, and cannot Stand up to God’s plotting against the disbelievers.","Let those who sacrifice the life of this world for the Hereafter fight in the way of Allah; for whoever fights in the way of Allah, whether he is killed or attains victory, We will give him a great reward. . Why is it that you do not fight in the way of Allah and for the sake of the oppressed men, women, and children who say, “Our Lord, take us out of this town[53] of oppressive people, and grant us from Yourself a protector and grant us from Yourself a helper”? . The believers fight in the way of Allah, whereas the disbelievers fight in the way of Tāghoot[54] [i.e., false gods]. So fight the allies of Satan. Indeed, the scheme of Satan is ever weak.","[53] i.e., Makkah. . [54] See footnote 4:60."
4,77,79,"Have you not seen those to whom it was said, ‘Redrain your hands, from fighting the disbeliev¬ 
ers when they desired it at Mecca, because of the harm the disbelievers had inflicfted upon them — and 
these were a group from among the Companions — and establish the prayer, and pay the alms’? Then, 
as soon as fighting was prescribed, was made obligatory, for them, lo, a party of them fear people, the 
disbelievers, that is, [they fear] punishment at their hands through death, as they would fear, the pun¬ 
ishment of, God, or with more fear, than their fear of Him ( ashadda, ‘more’, is in the accusative because 
it is a circumstantial qualifier; the response to the lammd, ‘as soon as’, is indicated by idha, ‘lo’, and what 
follows), in other words, they are taken aback by fear, and they said, frightened of death, ‘Our Lord, 
why have You prescribed fighting for us? Why not ( lawld is [to be understood as] holla) defer us to a 
near term?’ Say, to them: ‘The enjoyment of this world, that which is enjoyed therein, or enjoying it [the 
world], is trifling, it will end up by perishing; and the Hereafter, Paradise, is better for him who fears 
God’s punishment by avoiding disobedience to Him; and you shall not be wronged (la tuzlamuna, may 
also be read la yuzlamuna, ‘they shall not be wronged’) you shall not be diminished of your deeds, a 
single date-thread, as much as the peel on a date-Stone, so Struggle [in the way of God]. Wherever you may be, death will overtake you, though you should be in raised-up, lofty, tow¬ 
ers’, forts, so do not shrink from fighting for fear of death. And if a good thing, such as fertility and 
abundance, befalls them, the Jews, they say, ‘This is from God’; but if an evil thing, such as drought or 
misfortune, befalls them, as it did with them when the Prophet (s) arrived in Medina, they say, ‘This 
is from you’, O Muhammad (s), that is, from the bad luck [you bring]. Say, to them: ‘Everything, good 
and evil, is from God.’ What is wrong with this people that they do not understand, that is, they do not 
come close to comprehending, any words, delivered to them (the ma, ‘what’ [of ma li-haula, ‘what is 
wrong with these’] is an interrogative intended to provoke amazement at their extreme ignorance; to 
State that one cannot even come close to doing something is [rhetorically] more intense than saying that 
he cannot do it). 

5 'Attab b. Asid b. Umayya b. 'Abd Shams al-Qurashi became a Muslim on the day Mecca was conquered. The Prophet left him 
in charge of Mecca when he set out for Hunayn and he would remain in charge of it even after the Prophet’s death, his position 
being sanctioned by Abu Bakr. He is said to have died on the same day as the caliph Abu Bakr (d. 13/634); see Ibn al-Athir, Usd, 
ill, 549ft; Ibn Hajar, Tahdhlb, iv, 59ft (no. 5092).

Tafsir al-Jalalayn Whatever good ( hasana means khayr ) befalls you, O man, it is from God, it has come to you from 
His bounty; whatever evil, misfortune, befalls you is from yourself, it has come to you as a necessary 
consequence of sins you have committed. We have sent you, O Muhammad (s), to people as a messenger 
(rasulan, is a circumstantial qualifier for emphasis), and God suffices as Witness, of your Mission.","Have you not seen those who were told, “Restrain your hands [from fighting][55], establish prayer and give zakah”? However, when fighting was ordained for them, a group of them feared people as one should fear Allah or even more. They said, “Our Lord, why have You ordained fighting for us? If only you had spared us for a little while.” Say, “The enjoyment of this world is little, and the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah. And you will not be wronged, even as much as a thread of a date stone. . Wherever you are, death will overcome you, even if you are in fortified towers.” If something good happens to them, they say, “This is from Allah,” but if something bad happens to them, they say, “This is from you[56].” Say, “All is from Allah.” What is wrong with these people that they hardly understand any words? . Whatever good happens to you[57] is from Allah, but whatever bad happens to you is from yourself[58].

4,80,84,"Whoever obeys the Messenger, verily obeys God; and whoever turns his back, [whoever] avoids 
obedience to you, do not be concerned with them: We have not sent you as a watcher over them, to keep 
watch over their deeds, but as a warner. Their affair is Ours [to deal with] and We will requite them. This 
[Statement] was before the command to fight [them was revealed]. T hey say, that is, the hypocrites [say] when they come to you, ‘Our affair is [all about] Obedience, 
to you’; but when they sally forth, [when] they depart, from you, a party of them harbour (the [final] 
ta [of the feminine-ending in bayyatat, ‘harbour’] can either be elided with the following ta [of taifa, 
‘a party’] or simply omitted) they entertain secretly [feelings], other than what they say, to you in your 
presence in the way of [their] obedience, in other words, [they hide] disobedience to you. God writes 
down. He commands that it be written, what they harbour, in their scrolls [of deeds], so that they will be 
requited for it. So turn away from them, in forgiveness, rely on God, put your truSt in Him, for He will 
suffice you; and God suffices as a Guardian, to Whom matters are entrusted. What, do they not ponder, do they [not] contemplate, the Qur’an?, and the marvellous truths 
contained in it. If it had been from other than God surely they would have found therein much incon¬ 
sistency, [much] contradiction in meaning and irregularity in arrangement. And when there comes to them an issue, [news] concerning the raiding parties sent by the Prophet 
(5) and what has happened to them, be it of security, through victory, or of fear, through defeat, they 
broadcast it, they make it widely-known: this was revealed regarding a group from among the hypo¬ 
crites, or from among the feeble believers, who used to do this, and so the hearts of the believers would 
lose courage and the Prophet (s) would become distressed. If they had referred it, the news, to the Mes¬ 
senger and to those in authority among them, that is, the judicious elders among the Companions, in 
other words, if they had kept quiet about it until they were fully informed; those among them who are 
able to think it out, [those who] follow it up and seek knowledge of it, the ones who broadcast it, would 
have known it, and whether it is a matter that ought be broadcast or not, from them, from the Prophet 
(s) and those of authority. And but for the bounty of God to you, through Islam, and His mercy, to you 
through the Qur’an, you would surely have followed Satan, in the abominations to which he commands 
you, except a few [of you], So fight, O Muhammad (s), in the way of God; you are charged only with yourself, so do not 
be concerned with their failing to join you, the meaning being: fight, even if you are on your own, for 
you have been promised victory. And urge on the believers, incite them to fight and make them desire 
it; maybe God will restrain the might, the war, of the disbelievers; God is mightier, than them, and 
more severe in castigation, in punishment, than them. And so the Messenger of God (s) said: ‘By Him 
in Whose Hand is my soul, I shall sally forth [to fight], even if [I go] alone’. Thereupon, he sallied forth 
with seventy cavalrymen to the firSt [battle at] Badr, where God restrained the might of the disbelievers 
by casting terror into their hearts and preventing Abu Sufyan from sallying forth, as has already been 
mentioned in [siirat] Al ‘Imran [Q. 3:151].","Whoever obeys the Messenger has indeed obeyed Allah[59]. But anyone who turns away, We have not sent you [O Prophet] as a keeper over them[60]. . They say, “We obey you,” but as soon as they leave you, a group of them[61] conspires by night against what you say. Allah records all their plots, so turn away from them, and put your trust in Allah. And sufficient is Allah as a Trustee of Affairs. . Do they not then ponder on the Qur’an[62]? If it had been from anyone other than Allah, they would have surely found in it many discrepancies. . Whenever they hear any news of security or fear, they spread it[63]. If they referred it to the Messenger or to those in authority among them, those with sound judgment among them could know it. Were it not for Allah’s grace and mercy, you would all have followed Satan, except for a few. . So fight in the way of Allah [O Prophet]; you are accountable only for yourself. But urge the believers [to fight]; perhaps Allah will restrain the might of the disbelievers, for Allah is strongest in might and severe in punishment.","[59] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Whoever obeys me has obeyed Allah, and whoever disobeys me has disobeyed Allah”. [Al-Bukhārī: 7137, Muslim: 1835]
 [60] You are tasked only to convey the message. . [61] i.e., the hypocrites. . [62] i.e., its words, meanings and directives. . [63] These hypocrites are the blabbers, a fifth column within the ranks of the believers who spread whatever news comes their way aiming to stir up unrest."
4,85,87,"Whoever intercedes, between people, with a good intercession, one in accordance with the Law, 
shall receive a share of, the reward for, it, because of it; and whoever intercedes with an evil intercession, 
one in contravention of it [the Law], shall receive the like, the share of the sin, from it, because of it. God 
conserves. He has power over, all things, and so requites every person according to his deeds. And when you are greeted with a greeting, as when it is said to you, ‘Peace be upon you’, greet, 
the one that greeted you, with better than it, by responding to him with, ‘Peace be upon you, and God’s 
mercy and blessings’, or return it, by saying back to him what he said; in other words, it is a duty to greet 
in one of these two ways, the former being the preferred one. Surely God keeps count of. He holds [you] 
accountable for, all things, and requites accordingly, including things such as returning a greeting. The 


Sura al-Nisa 


Sunna Verifies that one should not return the greeting of an disbeliever, an innovator, a wicked person, 
and of the one that greets a person who is in the acft of relieving himself, or one in the bath, or one eating 
— indeed it is actually disapproved with the exception of the laSt. To the disbeliever [who says ‘peace be 
upon you’] one should simply say, ‘And upon you’. God — there is no god except Him, and by God, He will surely gather you, from your graves, to, 
on, the Day of Resurrection whereof there is no doubt, no uncertainty And who is truer in Statement, in 
Speech, than God?, that is, no one is.","Whoever intercedes in a good cause will have a share in its reward, but whoever intercedes in an evil cause will have a share in its burden[64]. And Allah is ever Watchful over all things. . When you are given a greeting, respond with a better greeting or return the same[65]. Indeed, Allah is the Reckoner of all things. . Allah: None has the right to be worshiped except Him. He will surely gather you all on the Day of Resurrection, about which there is no doubt. Who is more truthful in speech than Allah?","[64] Abu Mūsa al-Ash‘arī (رضي الله عنه) said: “When a person in need came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) or when he was asked for something, he would announce: “Intercede; you will be rewarded!” [Al-Bukhārī: 1432] Yet when a person knowingly helps someone who intends evil is a partner in that misdeed and thus will reap a portion of that evil. . [65] ‘Imrān ibn al-Husayn (رضي الله عنه) said: “A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: “Assalāmu ‘alaykum (Peace be upon you)”. He was replied to and sat down. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Ten (rewards)”. Then another one came and said: “Assalāmu ‘alaykum wa raḥmatu Allah (Peace be upon you and Allah’s Mercy)”. He was replied to and sat down. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Twenty”. Then another one came and said: “Assalāmu ‘alaykum wa raḥmatu Allah wa barakātuhu (Peace be upon you and Allah’s Mercy and His Blessings)”. He was replied to and sat down. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Thirty”. [Abū Dāwūd: 5195, At-Tirmidhī: 2689, Ahmad: 19948]"
4,88,89,"When a group retreated from Uhud, people were at variance over their status. Some said, ‘Let us 
slay them’, while others said, ‘No!’ So the following was revealed: What is wrong with you, what is the 
matter with you, that you have become two parties, two groups, regarding the hypocrites, when God has 
overthrown them. He has turned them back [to disbelief], for what they earned?, in the way of disbelief 
and adts of disobedience. What, do you desire to guide him whom God has sent aStray?, that is, to count 
them among the guided (the interrogative in both places is for disapproval). And he whom God sends 
aSlray, you will never find for him a way, a path to guidance. They long, they wish, that you should disbelieve as they disbelieve, so then you, and they, would 
be equal, in unbelief; therefore do not take friends from among them, associating with them, even if 
they should [outwardly] manifest belief, until they emigrate in the way of God, a proper emigration that 
would confirm their belief; then, if they turn away, and remain upon their ways, take them, as captives, 
and slay them wherever you find them; and do not take any of them as a patron, to associate with, or as 
a helper, to assist you against your enemy.","What is the matter with you that you are divided into two groups concerning the hypocrites when Allah has reverted them [to disbelief] because of their misdeeds? Do you want to guide those whom Allah has caused to stray? Whoever Allah causes to stray, you will never find a way [to guidance] for him. . They wish that you would disbelieve just as they have disbelieved so that you become all alike. Therefore do not take from them allies unless they migrate for the sake of Allah. But if they turn away, seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and do not take from them any allies or helpers,",
4,90,91,"Except those who attach themselves to, [who] seek refuge with, a people between whom and you 
there is a covenant, a pledge of security for them and for whoever attaches himself to them, in the man¬ 
ner of the Prophet’s (s) covenant with Hilal b. ‘Uwaymir al-Aslami; 6 or, those who, come to you with their 
breaSts constricted, dejeded, about the proSpeCl of fighting you, [being] on the side of their people, or 
fighting their people, siding with you, in other words, [those who come to you] refraining from fighting 
either you or them, then do not interfere with them, neither taking them as captives nor slaying them: 
this statement and what follows was abrogated by the ‘sword’ verse. Had God willed, to give them sway 
over you, He would have given them sway over you, by strengthening their hearts, so that assuredly they 
would have fought you: but God did not will it and so He cad terror into their hearts. And so if they Stay 
away from you and do not fight you, and offer you peace, reconciliation, that is, [if] they submit, then 
God does not allow you any way againSt them, [He does not allow you] a means to take them captive 
or to slay them. You will find others desiring to have security from you, by manifesting belief before you, and 
security from their own people, through unbelief, when they return to them, and these were [the tribes 
of] Asad and Ghatafan; yet whenever they are returned to sedition, [whenever] they are summoned to 
idolatry, they are overwhelmed by it, falling into it in the worSt of ways. So, if they do not Slay away from 
you, by refraining from fighting you, and, do not, offer you peace, and, do not, restrain their hands, 
from you, then take them, as captives, and slay them wherever you come upon them, [wherever] you 
find them; againSt them We have given you clear warrant, a clear and manifest proof for you to slay 
them and capture them, on account of their treachery.","except those who join a people with whom you have a treaty[66] or those who come to you feeling discomfort to fight you or fight their own people. If Allah had willed, He would have empowered them to fight you. Therefore if they withdraw and refrain from fighting you and offer you peace, then Allah has not given you permission [to fight] against them. . You will find others who wish to be secure from you and from their own people. Whenever they are tempted back to disbelief, they fall into it. Therefore if they do not withdraw, or offer you peace, or restrain their hands from you, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them; they are those against whom We have given you a clear authority.","[66] Believers should honor their pledges. If a party with which believers have a peace treaty accepts those who come to them seeking refuge, then, by extension, the treaty includes them as well."
4,92,93,"It is not for a believer to slay a believer, in other words, no such slaying should result at his hands, 
except by mistake, killing him by mistake, unintentionally. He who slays a believer by mistake, when he 
meant to Strike some other thing, as in the case of hunting or [shooting at] trees, but then happens to 
Strike him with what in moSt cases would not kill, then let him set free, let him emancipate, a believing 
slave (raqaba denotes nasama, ‘a person), an obligation on him, and blood-money is to be submitted, 
to be paid, to his family, that is, the slain person’s inheritors, unless they remit it as a charity, to him by 

6 Baydawi, in his commentary on this verse (see Q. 4:90 in his Anwar al-tanzll wa-asrar al-ta’wil), identifies Hilal b. ‘Uwaymir 
as the leader of the Banu Aslam with whom the Prophet made a pad, upon setting out to capture Mecca, to the effed that the 
former would remain non-aligned in any conflid involving the Muslims.

waiving [their claim to] it. In the Sunna this [blood-money] is explained as being equivalent to one hun¬ 
dred camels: twenty pregnant, twenty female sucklings, twenty male sucklings, twenty mature ones and 
twenty young ones [not more than five years old]; and [the Sunna stipulates] that it is incumbent upon 
the killer’s clan, namely, his paternal relations [and not other relatives]. They share this [burden of the 
blood-money] over three years; the rich among them pays half a dinar, while the one of moderate means 
[pays] a quarter of a dinar each year; if they Still cannot meet this, then it can be taken from the treasury, 
and if this is not possible, then from the killer himself. If he, the slain, belongs to a people at enmity, at 
war, with you and is a believer, then the setting free of a believing slave, is incumbent upon the slayer, 
as a redemption, but no bloodmoney is to be paid to his family, since they are at war [with you]. If he, 
the slain, belongs to a people between whom and you there is a covenant, a treaty, as is the case with 
the Protected People (ahl al-dhimma ), then the blood-money, for him, mu it be paid to his family, and it 
constitutes a third of the blood-money for a believer, if the slain be a Jew or a Christian, and two thirds 
of a tenth of it, if he be a Magian; and the setting free of a believing slave, is incumbent upon the slayer. 
But if he has not the wherewithal, for [setting free] a slave, failing to find one, or the means to obtain 
one, then the failing of two successive months, is incumbent upon him as a redemption: here God does 
not mention the transition to [an alternative to faSting which is] giving food [to the needy], as in the case 
of [repudiating one’s wife by] zihar , 7 something which al-Shafi‘1 advocates in the more correcft of two 
opinions of his; a relenting from God (tawbatan, ‘relenting’, is the verbal noun, and is in the accusative 
because of the implied verb). And God is ever Knowing, of His creation, Wise, in what He has ordained 
for them. And whoever slays a believer deliberately, intending to kill him, with something that is lethal, 
aware of the facft that he [the slain] is a believer, his requital is Hell, abiding therein, and God is wroth 
with him and has cursed him. He has removed him from His mercy, and has prepared for him a mighty 
chastisement, in the Fire: this may be explained as [referring to] the person that deems such [killing] 
licit, or as being his requital if he were to be requited, but it would not be anything new if this threat [of 
punishment] were to be forgone, because of what He says: Other than that [that is, idolatry] He forgives 
whomever He will [Q. 4:48]. It is reported from Ibn ‘Abbas that it [the verse] should be understood as 
it Stands, abrogating other verses of‘forgiveness’. The verse in [surat] al-Baqara [Q. 2:178] clearly indi¬ 
cates that the one who kills deliberately should be killed in return, or if he is pardoned then he has to 
pay the blood-money, the value of which has already been mentioned. It is made clear in the Sunna that 
between the intentional and the unintentional, there is a type of killing that is identified as [being with] 
quasi-deliberate intent ( shibh al-’amd), where the killer has slain with what in moSt cases is not [a] lethal 
[implement]. In such a case, there is no [right to] retaliation and blood-money is paid instead, so that it 
[this type of killing] is described as intentional, but [considered] unintentional in [that there applies] the 
fixing of the period [for payment] and the sharing of the burden [by the killer’s clan]; in this [case] and 
that of intentional killing redemption is more urgent than in unintentional killing.","It is not for a believer to kill another believer except by mistake. Whoever kills a believer by mistake[67] must free a believing slave and pay blood money to his family, unless they waive it as an act of charity. But if the victim was a believer and belonged to people at war with you, then a believing slave must be freed. If he belonged to a people with whom you have a treaty, then blood money must be paid to his family and the freeing of a believing slave. Anyone who is unable must fast for two consecutive months[68] by way of repentance to Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. . But anyone who kills a believer deliberately, his punishment will be Hell, abiding therein forever; Allah will be displeased with him and will curse him, and will prepare for him a great punishment[69].","[67] Inadvertent manslaughter usually results from some degree of negligence or error, thus, this punishment is ordained for not being cautious enough.
 [68] Uninterrupted fast except when there is a valid reason, e.g., illness, menses for women etc. . [69] Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) said: ""A faithful believer remains at liberty regarding his religion unless he kills someone unlawfully."" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 2]"
4,94,94,"The following was revealed when a group from among the Companions passed by a man from 
the Banu Sulaym driving his flock of sheep, and he offered them a greeting of peace. But they said, ‘He 
only greeted us dissimulating, out of fear’. So they killed him and took away his flock: O you who be¬ 
lieve, when you are going forth, travelling in order to struggle, in the way of God, be discriminating 
( fa-tabayyanu; a variant reading has fa-tathabbatu, ‘ascertain, here and further below); and do not say 
to him who offers you peace (read al-salam or al-salam ), that is, the greeting, or [offers you] submission, 
declaring the profession of faith ( shahada ), which is an indication of being a Muslim: ‘You are not a be¬ 
liever: you are only saying this to dissimulate for fear of your life and property’, so that you then end up 
killing him, desiring, seeking by this, the transient goods of the life of this world, that is, its enjoyment, in 
the way of spoils. With God are plenteous Spoils, rendering you free of the need to kill such a person for 

7 This is because, unlike the case of the intentional killing of a believer, in the case of zihar if one is unable to faSt two months 
consecutively, then one may resort to feeding the poor, as the Jalalayn commentary points out at Q. 58:4. The term zihar, a repudia¬ 
tion of sorts, referred to the injurious practice of declaring to one’s wife the following: ‘you are to me as [untouchable as] the back 
(zahr) of my mother’. Such comparisons, although they did not dissolve marriages, were meant as preambles to the termination of 
conjugal life. The custom itself originated in the pre-Islamic period but, judging by the Qur’anic references and hadtth narrations, 
it was Still being practised while the Prophet was alive; see Schacht, Introduction, 165; ‘Abd al-Rahman I. Doi, Shariah: the Islamic 
Law (London: Ta Ha Publishers, 1984), 183-5.

his properly. So you were formerly, when your lives and property were protected simply upon your pro¬ 
fessing the faith; but God has been gracious to you, making you known for your faith and uprightness. 
So be discriminating, le& you kill a believer and treat those entering the religion as you were treated 
[formerly]. Surely God is ever Aware of what you do, and will requite you for it.","O you who believe, when you go to fight in the way of Allah, make sure [who you fight]; and do not say to someone who offers you the greetings of peace, “You are not a believer”[70] – seeking gains of the life of this world, while Allah has abundant gains. You were in the same position before, then Allah blessed you [with Islam]. Therefore make sure, for Allah is All-Aware of what you do.",[70] This is someone who withholds from fighting and declares that he is a believer.
4,95,96,"The believers who sit at home, away from the struggle, other than those who have an injury, such 
as a chronic illness or blindness or the like (read in the nominative, ghayru uli l-darar, other than those 
who have an injury’, as an adjectival clause; or in the accusative, ghayra uli l-darar, as an exceptive clause) 
are not the equals of those who ftruggle in the way of God with their possessions and their lives. God 
has preferred those who ftruggle with their possessions and their lives over the ones who sit at home, 
on account of some injury, by a degree, by [a degree of] merit, since both have the same intention, but 
the extra degree is given to those who have carried out the struggle; yet to each, of the two groups, God 
has promised the goodly reward. Paradise, and God has preferred those who ftruggle over the ones who 
sit at home, without any injury, with a great reward ( ajran ‘aziman, is substituted by [the following, 
darajatin minhu ]), degrees, that is, Stations one higher than the other in honour, from Him, and forgiveness and 
mercy (maghfiratan and rahmatan are in the accusative because [they constitute an objeCt] of the implied 
verb [faddala, ‘He has preferred’]). Surely God is ever Forgiving, to His friends. Merciful, to those that 
obey Him.","Not equal are those believers who stay behind – except those forced by necessity – and those who fight in the way of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has given a higher rank to those who fight with their wealth and their lives than those who stay behind. To each Allah has promised a fine reward[71], but Allah has favored those who fight over those who stay behind with a great reward, . high ranks from Him, and forgiveness and mercy. For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","[71] i.e., Paradise."
4,97,100,"The following was revealed regarding a group of people who submitted to Islam but did not emi¬ 
grate and were then slain in the battle of Badr alongside the disbelievers: And those whom the angels 
take [in death], while they are wronging their souls, having remained among the disbelievers and ne¬ 
glected to emigrate, the angels will say, to them in rebuke: ‘What was your predicament?’, in other 
words, ‘in what circumstances were you with regard to your religion’. They will say, giving excuses, ‘We 
were oppressed, unable to establish religion, in the land’, the land of Mecca. The angels will say, to them 
in rebuke: ‘But was not God’s earth fpacious that you might have emigrated therein?’, from the land of 
unbelief to another land, as others did? God, exalted be He, says: as for such, their abode shall be Hell 
— an evil journey’s end, it is! Except the oppressed among the men, women, and children who are unable to devise a plan, 
having no Strength to emigrate and no substance, and are not guided to a way, a means [of going] to the 
land of emigration. As for such, perhaps God will pardon them, for God is ever Pardoning, Forgiving. Whoever emigrates in the way of God will find in the earth many refuges, places of emigration, 
and abundance, of provision; whoever goes forth from his house as an emigrant to God and His Mes¬ 
senger, and then death overtakes him, along the way, as occurred with Junda‘ [or Jundab] b. Damra al- 
Laythl, 8 his wage is then incumbent upon, fixed [with], God; surely God is ever Forgiving, Merciful.","When the angels take the souls of those who have wronged themselves, they will say, “What was the matter with you?” They will say, “We were oppressed in the land.” They will say, “Was not Allah’s earth spacious enough for you to migrate[72]?” They are those whose refuge will be Hell – what a terrible destination! . Except the helpless men, women, and children who have no means nor do they know where to go. . They are those whom Allah may pardon, for Allah is Ever-Pardoning, All-Forgiving. . Whoever emigrates for the sake of Allah will find on earth many places of refuge and abundant provision. Whoever leaves his home emigrating for the cause of Allah and His Messenger, then death overtakes him, his reward has already been secured with Allah. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","[72] By remaining among the disbelievers in an environment where a Muslim is unable to practice his religion freely, although they have the means to emigrate."
4,101,103,"And when you are going forth, travelling, in the land you woidd not be at fault if you shorten 
the prayer, by making it two [genuflexions] instead of four, if you fear that you may be ajflided by 
those who do not believe, that is, [if you fear] that you may be harmed [by them]: this [fear of affliction 
at the hands of the disbelievers] is [juSt intended as] an explication of the reality [of the situation] at 
that time and the point no longer applies. In the Sunna, it is pointed out that ‘travel’ ( safar ) means long¬ 
distance [travel], which is [approximately] 50 miles. 9 God’s words ‘you would not be at fault’ should be 

8 The prosopographical dictionaries are not sure whether this persons name was Jundab or Junda‘, but are unanimous in identify¬ 
ing him with the verse in question. He declared his intention to emigrate to join the Prophet but died along the way before reaching 
him; see Ibn al-Athir, Usd, 1, 566, 573. 

9 For medieval Muslims, the term barld (plural burud ) denoted the distance between mailing posts: 1 band equalled ^farsakhs 
(the Ancient Persian parasang = 3 14 miles), which means that the minimum distance required for the prayer to be shortened is 
somewhere between 48 and 52 miles, or 50 miles on average; see Ibn Manzur, Lisan, s.v. ‘b-r-d’. One reaches approximately the 
same figure for this distance with 2 marhalas (plural mardhil). 2 marhalas are estimated to be 24,986.5 kassabahs (the Egyptian 
linear measure qasaba), and since r kassabah equals 3.55 metres, the distance of 2 marhalas comes to 88,702 metres, roughly 55 
miles; cf. FIruzabadI, Qamus, s.v. ‘r-h- 1 ’.

understood as [denoting] a dispensation and not a requirement, and this is the opinion of al-Shafi‘1; the 
disbelievers are a manifest foe to you, their enmity being evident. When you, O Muhammad (s), are, present, among them, while you [all] fear an enemy, and you 
Stand to lead them in prayer (this type of address is cuStomary in the Qur’an), 10 let a party of them Stand 
with you, while another party Stand back, and let them, the party Standing with you, take their weapons, 
with them. Then when they have performed their prostrations, that is, [when] they have prayed, let 
them, the other party, be behind you, on guard until you complete the prayers; thereupon, let this party 
go on guard, and let another party who have not prayed come and pray with you, taking their precau¬ 
tions and their weapons, with them until you have completed the prayers. The Prophet (s) did this once 
at Batn Nakhla, 11 as reported by the two Shaykhs [Bukhari and Muslim]. The disbelievers wish, when 
you have Stood up to pray, that you should be heedless of your weapons and your baggage that they 
may descend upon you all at once, by making an assault againSt you and capturing you, and herein is 
the reasoning behind keeping weapons on oneself. You are not at fault, if rain bothers you, or if you are 
sick, to lay aside your weapons, and not carry them: this implies that when there is no such excuse, it is 
compulsory to carry them, and this is one of two opinions held by al-Shafi‘1 [on this matter]; the other 
[opinion] is that this [precaution] constitutes a sunna , 12 and this is the more preferable opinion. But take 
your precautions, againSt the enemy and be on your guard as beSt you can; God has prepared for the 
disbelievers a humiliating chastisement. When you have performed the prayer, [when] you have completed it, remember God, by [re¬ 
peating] ‘There is no god but God’ ( tahlil ) and ‘Glory be to God’ ( tasbih ), Standing and sitting and on 
your sides, lying down, in other words, in all States. Then, when you are reassured, [when] you are se¬ 
cure, observe the prayer, perform it with its proper due, surely the prayer is for believers a prescription, 
enjoined, that is, an obligation, at Specific times, that is, its appointed times are set, and so it should not 
be postponed from these times.","When you are traveling through the land, there is no blame on you to shorten the prayer[73], if you fear that the disbelievers may harm you[74]. Indeed, the disbelievers are your open enemy. . When you [O Prophet] are with them and lead them in prayer, let a group of them stand [in prayer] with you, carrying their weapons. When they have finished their prostration, let them take their positions in the rear. Then let the other group that has not yet prayed join you in prayer, keeping vigilant and carrying their arms[75]. The disbelievers wish that you would neglect your weapons and belongings, so they could launch on you a surprise attack. But there is no blame on you if you lay down your weapons because of the inconvenience of rain or because you are ill, but take all precautions. Indeed, Allah has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment. . When you have finished the prayer, remember Allah, standing, sitting, or lying down. But when you are safe again, establish regular prayer. Indeed, prayer is prescribed for the believers at specific times.","[73] Four rak‘ah prayers are shortened to two rak‘ahs.
 [74] Fear is not a condition for this concession, merely travel. . [75] This is the manner of prayer in danger on the battlefield."
4,104,104,"After they returned from Uhud, the Prophet (s) dispatched a group to seek out Abu Sufyan and 
his companions, but they complained about their wounds, and the following was revealed: Be not faint, 
[be not] weak, in seeking, in pursuing, the enemy, the disbelievers, in order to fight them; if you are suf¬ 
fering, [if] you have pains from a wound, they are also suffering as you are suffering, that is, juSt like 
you, yet they do not shrink from fighting you; and you hope from God, in the way of victory and the 
reward for it, that for which they cannot hope, and since you have this advantage over them, you should 
be more willing for it than them. God is ever Knower, of all things, Wise, in His acftions.","Do not weaken in pursuit of the enemy. If you are suffering harm, they too are suffering harm just like you; but you hope from Allah what they do not hope. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",

latter, Tu'ma accused him of having Stolen it, and swore by God that he [Tu'ma] had not Stolen it, and 
his clan asked the Prophet (s) to advocate on his behalf and absolve him, whereupon the following was 
revealed: Surely We have revealed to you the Book, the Qur’an, with the truth (bi’l-haqq is semantically 
connected to anzalna, ‘We have revealed’) so that you may judge between people by that which God has 
shown you, what God has taught you. And do not be a disputant for traitors, like Tu'ma, disputing on 
their behalf.","We have sent down the Book to you [O Prophet] in truth, so that you may judge between people, in accordance with what Allah has taught you. So do not be an advocate for the deceitful.",

Forgiving, Merciful. And do not dispute on behalf of those who betray themselves, through acfts of disobedience, for 

10 In other words, it is the custom of the Qur’an to address the Prophet in specific circumstances with a particular prescription; 
but this does not meant that the prescription only applies on occasions when he is present. In this verse, then, the Specific circum¬ 
stances set the general guidelines for the reSt of the community for performing prayer when in fear of some external threat. This 
sense is reinforced by the additional gloss given in the Bulaq edition of the Jalalayn,/«-/d mafhuma lahu: ‘it is not relevant in itself’. 
In other words the Prophet’s presence sets the precedent, but is not required for such prayer to be performed on future occasions.

frequently betraying, and sinfid, that is to say, He will punish him. 77 i ey, the likes of Tu'ma and his clan, hide themselves, in shame, from people, but they do not 
hide themselves from God; for He is with them, in His knowledge [of them], while they plot, they con- 
41 ire, at night with discourse displeasing to Him, in their resolve to swear by God and deny the theft and 
accuse the Jew of it. God is ever Encompassing, in knowledge, of what they do. Ah! There you are (addressing Tu'ma’s clan) you have contested, you have diluted, on their 
behalf, that is to say, on behalf of Tu'ma and his men (a variant reading has ‘anhu, ‘on his behalf’) in the 
life of this world; but who will contest againSt God on their behalf on the Day of Resurrection, if He 
were to punish them, or who will be a guardian for them, and take charge of their affair or defend them? 
In other words, no one will do such a thing.","And seek forgiveness of Allah[76], for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. . Do not argue on behalf of those who betray themselves, for Allah does not like the treacherous and sinful. . They seek to hide from people but they do not seek to hide from Allah, although He is with them when they devise plans to say things that are displeasing to Him[77]. Indeed, Allah encompasses all what they do. . Here you are, you are those who argue on their behalf in the life of this world[78], but who will argue on their behalf before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, or who will be their defender?","[76] Abu Hurayrah (رضي الله عنه) reported: I heard Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) saying: ""By Allah!

the Jew, or wrongs himself, committing a sin [the consequences of which are] limited to him, and then 
prays for God’s forgiveness, for it, that is to say, [and then] he repents, he shall find God is Forgiving, 
Merciful, to him. And whoever commits a sin commits it againSt himself only, since the evil consequences fall on 
him, harming no one else; and God is ever Knower, Wise, in His adtions. And whoever commits a mistake, a minor sin, or a sin, a grave sin, and then caSts it upon the 
innocent, [one who is innocent] of it, he has thereby burdened himself with calumny, by his false ac¬

Tafsir al-Jalalayn God has cursed him, He has removed him from His mercy. And he, namely, Satan, said, ‘Assur¬ 
edly I will take to myself, I will appoint for myself, an appointed portion, an apportioned share, of Your 
servants, [whom] I shall call to obey me. And I will surely lead them atfray, from truth with evil whimperings, and surely I will fill them 
with desires, I shall cash into their hearts [thoughts] that life will endure, that there will be no resurrec¬ 
tion and no reckoning; and surely I will command them and they will cut up the cattle’s ears, and this 
was done to the [she-camels they called] bahair. And surely I will command them and they will change 
God’s creation’, [substituting] His religion with unbelief, making lawful what God has made unlawful 
and making unlawful what God has made lawful. And whoever takes Satan for a patron, following him 
and obeying him, instead of God, has surely suffered a manifest loss, [one that is] evident, since he will 
end up in the Fire, made perpetual for him. He promises them, long life, and fills them with desires, of attaining their hopes in this world, 
and that there will be neither resurrection nor requital; but what Satan promises them, therewith, is only 
delusion, falsehood. For such — their abode shall be Hell, and they shall find no refuge from it, no alternative [to it].","They call upon none besides Him except female [idols][85]; they call upon none but a rebellious Satan[86] . whom Allah cursed, who said, “I will surely take hold of a designated portion of Your slaves. . And I will surely mislead them and arouse in them false hopes, and will order them to slit the ears of livestock, and will order them to change Allah’s creation[87].” Whoever takes Satan as a protector instead of Allah has surely suffered a manifest loss. . [Satan] makes promises to them and arouses in them false hopes, but Satan makes no promises to them except delusion[88]. . It is they whose abode will be Hell, and they will find no escape from it.","[85] Arabs worshiped in the age of ignorance idols with female names, like: Lāt, ‘Uzzā, Manāt. See 53:19-20.
 [86] They only worship false idols because Satan seduced them into this. . [87] The Arab idolaters used to cut off the ears of cattle as a sign that such were dedicated to their gods, making them unlawful to eat; calling such cattle bahīrah. By doing so, they followed the path of Satan, not that of Allah Who made the eating of cattle lawful. .

the People of the Scripture, but upon righteous deeds. Whoever does evil shall be requited for it, either

a hanif? (hanifan is a circumstantial qualifier), that is to say, [one] inclining away from all religions to 
the upright religion. And God took Abraham for a close friend, as His eledt, one whose love for Him is 
pure. To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth, as possessions, creatures and servants; 
and God is ever the Encompasser of all things, in knowledge and power, that is, He is ever possessed of 
such attributes.","But those who believe and do righteous deeds, We will admit them into gardens under which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. Allah’s promise is true.

To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth. Indeed, Allah encompasses all things.","[89] “They said: “None will enter Paradise except a Jew or a Christian.” That is their wishful thinking.

possessions and any inheritance due to her; if she was unattractive, however, he would not marry her and would prevent her from 
marrying another leSt he lose his claim to any inheritance. By turning the sentence into a negative one the authors of the Jalalayn 
can thus point out this latter situation, since the former is evident from the Qur’anic verse as it Stands.

Whatever good you do, God is ever Knower of it’, and He will requite you for it.","They ask you [O Prophet] concerning women. Say, “It is Allah Who gives you a ruling concerning them. It has been recited to you in the Book concerning orphan girls whom you deprive of their prescribed rights [i.e., dowry and inheritance], yet you desire to marry them, and concerning helpless children, and that you should treat orphans with justice.

4,128,130,"And if a woman ( wa-in imra’atun is in the nominative because of [it being the subject of] the 
explicative verb [that follows]) fears, anticipates, from her husband ill-treatment, if he looks down on 
her by refraining to sleep with her or by not maintaining her adequately, because he is averse to her and 
aspires to one more beautiful than her, or rejection, turning his face away from her, they are not at fault 
if they are reconciled through some agreement, in terms of shares and maintenance expenses, so that 
she concedes something to him in return for continuing companionship; if she agrees to this [then that 
is fine], but if [she does] not, then the husband mud either give her all her due, or part with her (an 
yassalaha, ‘they reconcile’: the original ta [of yatasdlaha] has been assimilated with the sad; a variant 
reading has an yusliha, from [the fourth form] aslaha ); reconciliation is better, than separation, ill- 
treatment or rejection. God, exalted be He, in explaining the natural disposition of man, says: But greed 
has been made present in the souls ( al-shuhh is extreme niggardliness), meaning that they have a natural 
propensity for this, as if they [the souls] are ever in its presence, never absent from it. The meaning is: a 
woman would scarcely allow [another] to share her husband with her, and a man would scarcely allow 
her [to enjoy] him if he were to fall in love with another. If you are virtuous, in your conjugal life with 
women, and fear, being unjust to them, surely God is ever aware of what you do, and He will requite 
you for it. You will never be able to be juft to, to treat equally, your wives, in terms of love, even if you be 
eager, for this; yet do not turn altogether away, towards the one you love with rested to the shares and 
maintenance expenses, so that you leave her, the one from whom you turn away, like one suspended, 
one that is neither a slavegirl nor a woman with a husband. If you set things right, by being jud with the 
shares, and fear, injustice, surely God is ever Forgiving, regarding the inclination in your hearts, Merci¬ 
ful, to you in this reaped:. But if they, the married couple, separate, by way of divorce, God will compensate each of them, 
[from the need] of the other, out of His plenty, that is, out of His bounty, by giving her another as hus¬ 
band, and giving him another as wife. God is ever Embracing, of His creatures in bounty, Wise, in what 
He has ordained for them.","If a woman fears ill-treatment or indifference on her husband’s part, there is no blame on them to reach an amicable reconciliation between themselves, for reconciliation is best[90], even though human souls are prone to avarice. If you do good and fear Allah, Allah is All-Aware of what you do. . You will never be able to maintain absolute justice between your wives, no matter how keen you are. So do not completely incline to one leaving the other in suspense[91]. If you do what is right and fear Allah, Allah is surely All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. . But if they choose to separate, Allah will compensate both out of His abundance[92], for Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Wise.","[90] This is better than breaking up. . [91] Neither divorced nor enjoying the marital rights. . [92] i.e., abundant provision from Allah or another spouse."

and to you: ‘If you disbelieve, in what you have been charged with, then to God belongs all that is in the

what is contained in them belongs to Him. If He will, He can remove you, O people, and bring others, indead of you, surely God is ever 
able to do that. Whoever desires, by his deeds, the reward of this world, then God has the reward of this world 
and of the Hereafter, for the one who wants it, and no one else has it, so why do any of you demand the

hearts are covered up’, and cannot grasji what you say — nay, but God sealed them for their disbelief 
and so they cannot heed any admonition; so they do not believe, except for a few, among them, like ‘Abd 
Allah b. Salam and his companions. And for their disbelief a second time, in Jesus (the ba [of bi-kufrihim, ‘for their disbelief’] is 
repeated in order to separate it [‘their disbelief’ in Jesus] from what is supplemented to it [‘their utter¬ 
ance against Mary’]) and their uttering again ft Mary a tremendous calumny, when they accused her 
of fornication. And for their saying, boastfully, ‘We slew the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, the Messenger of God’, 
as they claim: in other words, for all of these [reasons] We have punished them. God, exalted be He, says, 
in repudiating their claim to have killed him: And yet they did not slay him nor did they crucify him, but 
he, the one slain and crucified, who was an associate of theirs [the Jews], was given the resemblance, of 
Jesus. In other words, God caSt his [Jesus’s] likeness to him and so they thought it was him [Jesus]. And 
those who disagree concerning him, that is, concerning Jesus, are surely in doubt regarding, the slaying 
of, him, for some of them said, when they saw the slain man: the face is that of Jesus, but the body is 
not his, and so it is not he; and others said: no, it is he. They do not have any knowledge of, the slaying 
of, him, only the pursuit of conjecture (ilia ittibaa 1 -z.ann, is a discontinuous exception) in other words: 
‘instead, they follow conjecture regarding him, that which they imagined [they saw]’; and they did not 
slay him for certain ( yaqinan, a circumstantial qualifier emphasising the denial of the slaying). Nay, God raised him up to Him. God is ever Mighty, in His kingdom, Wise, in His acftions. And there is not one of the People of the Scripture but will assuredly believe in him, in Jesus, 
before his death, that is, [before the death] of one belonging to the People of the Scripture upon seeing 
the angels of death with his very eyes, at which point his faith will not profit him; or [it means] before 
the death of Jesus, after he descends at the approach of the Hour, as is Stated in hadith; and on the Day of 
Resurrection he, Jesus, will be a witness againd them, of what they did when he was sent to them. And because of the evildoing (fa-bi-zulmin is [to be understood as] fa-bi-sababi zulmin, ‘and for 
the reason of the evildoing’) of some of those of Jewry, the Jews, We have forbidden them certain good 
things that were lawful for them, those things [mentioned] where God says [And to those of Jewry] We 
have forbidden every bead with claws [Q. 6:146]; and because of their barring, of people, from God’s 
way, [from] His religion, many, a time. And because of their taking usury when they had been forbidden it, in the Torah, and their 
consuming people’s wealth through falsehood, through bribes in adjudications, and We have prepared 
for the disbelievers among them a painful chastisement.","The People of the Book ask you to bring down upon them a Book from heaven[103]. They had asked Moses even greater than that when they said, “Show us Allah openly.” But they were struck with a thunderbolt for their transgression. Then they took the calf for worship after receiving clear signs, yet We pardoned them, and We gave Moses compelling proof. . And We raised above them the Mount [to remind them] of their covenant, and We said to them, “Enter the gate [of Jerusalem] lowering your heads[104]”, and said to them: “Do not break the Sabbath”, and We took from them a solemn covenant. . [They were cursed] for breaking their covenant, rejecting the signs of Allah, killing the prophets unjustly, and for their saying, “Our hearts are wrapped up”. Rather, it is Allah Who has sealed them for their disbelief; so none of them will believe except a few – . and for their disbelief and for their monstrous allegation[105] against Mary, . and for their saying, “We killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.” But they did not kill him nor did they crucify him, but it was made to appear to them so. Even those who dispute it are in doubt about it; they have no certain knowledge other than conjecture. But they certainly did not kill him. . Rather, Allah raised him up to Himself[106], and Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. . There will be none from the People of the Book but will believe in him [upon his return] before his death[107], and on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them. . For the wrongdoing of the Jews, We prohibited for them good things[108] that were lawful for them; and for their frequent hindering many from the way of Allah, . and for their taking usury, although it was forbidden to them, and for unjustly consuming people’s wealth. We have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful punishment.","[103] This demand and all of the other Israelite infringements mentioned here are detailed in Surat al-Baqarah. See 2:50-66. . [104] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ""It was said to Bani Israel, ‘Enter the gate (of the town) bowing with humility and say: ‘Repentance’, but they changed the word and entered crawling on their buttocks and said: ‘A wheat grain in the hair’."" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 615]. They said so just to ridicule Allah’s order, as they were disobedient to Him. So Allah punished them severely, most probably with a plague. . [105] i.e., fornication. . [106] To Heaven. . [107] The prevalent interpretation is that the People of the Book, even the Jews, will believe in Jesus; his neither being ‘an impostor’ nor ‘the son of God’, when he descends from heaven at the end of time. . [108] For more details see 6:146."
4,162,162,"But those of them who are firmly rooted, established, in knowledge, like ‘Abd Allah b. Salam, 
and the believers, the Emigrants and the Helpers, believing in what has revealed to you, and what was 
revealed before you, of scriptures, and those who observe the prayer (wa’l-muqimina l-saldta is in the 
accusative because it is a laudative; it is also read in the nominative [wa’l-muqimuna l-saldta])-, and pay 
the alms, and those who believe in God and the Lad Day — to them We shall surely give ( nu’tihim, is 
also read yu’tihim, ‘He shall surely give’) a great wage, namely, Paradise.","But those well-grounded in knowledge among them and the believers believe in what has been sent down to you [O Prophet], and what was sent down before you; who establish prayer and give zakah, and believe in Allah and the Last Day – it is they who We will give a great reward.",
4,163,166,"We have revealed to you as We revealed to Noah, and the prophets after him, and, as, We re¬ 
vealed to Abraham and, his two sons, Ishmael and Isaac, and Jacob, the son of Isaac, and the Tribes, his 
[Jacob’s] children, and Jesus and Job and Jonah and Aaron, and Solomon, and We gave to, his father, 
David the Inscribed Book (read zaburan, it would denote the name of the revealed Book [cf. the Psalms]; 
read zuburan would make it a verbal noun, meaning mazburan, that is to say, maktuban, ‘inscribed’). And, We sent, messengers We have told you of before, and messengers We have not told you of. 
it is related that God sent eight thousand prophets [in total], four thousand [of them] from [the Children 
of] Israel, and [the remaining] four thousand from other peoples, as stated by the Shaykh [Jalal al-Dln

Sura al-Nisa 

al-Mahalll] in [his commentary on] surat Ghafir [Q. 40:78]; and Godfpoke diredly, without mediation, 
to Moses, messengers (rusulan, substitutes for the previous rusulan, messengers’) bearing good tidings, 
of reward for those that believe, and warning, of punishment for those that disbelieve; We sent them, 
so that people might have no argument, to make, again ft God after, the sending of, the messengers, to 
them, and say: Our Lord, why did you not send a messenger to us so that we might follow Your signs and be 
among the believers [Q. 28:47]; thus We sent them to pre-empt such excuses. God is ever Mighty, in His 
kingdom, Wise, in His acftions. When the Jews were asked about his [Muhammad’s] prophethood (s) and they denied him, 
the following was revealed: But God bears witness. He makes clear [the truth of] your prophethood, 
with what He has revealed to you, of the miraculous Qur’an; He has revealed it, enveloped, through 
His knowledge, that is, [He has revealed it] knowing it fully, or [He has revealed it] with His knowledge 
therein; and the angels also bear witness, to you; and God suffices as a Witness, to this.","We have sent revelation to you [O Prophet] just as We revealed to Noah and the prophets after him. We also sent revelation to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and his descendants, and to Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and We gave David the Psalms. . There are messengers whose stories We have already mentioned to you and messengers We have not mentioned to you. And Allah spoke to Moses directly[109]. . These messengers were sent as bearers of glad tidings and as warners, so that the people may have no excuse before Allah after [the coming of] the messengers. For Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. . But Allah bears witness to what He has sent down to you, as He has sent it down with His knowledge, and the angels bear witness, but sufficient is Allah as a Witness.","[109] Use of the absolute object (maf‘ūl mutlaq) means that Allah addressed Moses directly in a manner befitting His Majesty, without a medium, in words that he heard and understood."
4,167,169,"Surely those who disbelieve, in God, and bar, people, from the way of God, [from] the religion 
of Islam, by concealing the descriptions of Muhammad (s), and these are the Jews, they have indeed gone 
far aftray, from the truth. Surely those who disbelieve, in God, and who have done wrong, to the Prophet, by concealing 
his descriptions, it is not for God to forgive them, neither to guide them to any path, whatever, except for the path of Hell, that is, [to] the path that leads to it, abiding, it is decreed for them to 
abide, therein, once they enter it , forever; and for God that is an easy matter.","Those who disbelieve and prevent others from the way of Allah have gone far astray. . Those who disbelieve and do wrong, Allah will not forgive them nor will He guide them to a way . except the way of Hell, abiding therein forever. And that is easy for Allah.",
4,170,170,"O people, of Mecca, the Messenger, Muhammad (5), has now come to you with the truth from 
your Lord; so believe, in him and seek what, it is better for you, than that which you are presently seek¬ 
ing. And if you disbelieve, in him, then surely to God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth, 
as possessions, creatures and servants, and your disbelief will not harm Him; and God is ever Knowing, 
of His creation, Wise, in what He does with them.","O people, the Messenger has come to you with the truth from your Lord, so believe; it is better for you. But if you disbelieve, [know that] all that is in the heavens and earth belongs to Allah, and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
4,171,172,"O People of the Scripture, the GoSJrel, do not go to extremes, do not go beyond the bounds, in 
your religion and do not say about God except, the saying of, the truth, such as exalting Him above any 
associations with a partner or a child: the Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, was only the Messenger of 
God, and His Word which He caft to, [which] He conveyed to, Mary, and a fpirit, that is, one whose 
Spirit is, from Him: he [Jesus] is here attached to God, exalted be He, as an honouring for him, and not 
as you claim, that he is the son of God, or a god alongside Him, or one of three, because one that pos¬ 
sesses a Spirit is compound, while God transcends being compound and the attribution of compounds 
to Him. So believe in God and His messengers, and do not say, that the gods are, ‘Three’, God, Jesus and 
his mother. Refrain, from this and say what, it is better for you, [to say], which is the profession of His 
Oneness. Verily, God is but One God. Glory be to Him, transcending [the possibility], that He shoidd 
have a son! To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth, as possessions, creatures and 
servants, and such sovereignty is not compatible with [that] prophethood [of Jesus]. God suffices as a 
Guardian, a Witness to this. The Messiah, whom you claim is a god, would never disdain, [would never] scorn or rejed 
haughtily, to be a servant of God, neither would the angels who are nigh, to God, disdain to be serv¬ 
ants: this is a Splendid digression [to the matter of the angels], and it is mentioned as a refutation of 
those who claim that they [the angels] are gods or the daughters of God, jud as He refuted, with what 
was dated before, the Christians who claim that which is the subject of the address to them [above]. 
Whoever disdains to worship Him, and waxes proud, He will assuredly mufter them to Him, all of 
them, in the Hereafter.","O People of the Book, do not go to extremes in your religion, and do not say about Allah but the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, was only a messenger of Allah, and His Word that He bestowed upon Mary, and a spirit[110] from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers and do not say “Three” [i.e., Trinity]. Cease; that is better for you. Indeed, Allah is the only One God. Glory be to Him, [far exalted is He] to have a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth, and sufficient is Allah as a Disposer of Affairs. . The Messiah would never disdain to be a slave of Allah, nor would the nearest angels to Him. Those who disdain to worship Him and are arrogant, He will gather them all together before Him.","[110] That is, Jesus’s spirit was created by Allah. [Ibn Kathīr, al-Sa‘dī]. Al-Baghawī says: “He (Jesus) is a soul just like any other soul but Allah added him to Himself to honor him”. Al-Shawkānī is also of this opinion. Al-Alūsī says: “Because Jesus was created by a blow (of air), not by a drop (of sperm), he was called a ‘soul’.” The Qur’an makes it clear that Jesus is just like all other human beings, whose spirit was created by Allah."

‘perishes’] that explains it) perishes, dies, having no children, and no parent, and this is the one referred 
to as an indirect heir ( kalala ), but he has a siSter, from both parents or from one, hers is half of what he

son, then he [the maternal uncle] receives nothing, and if a daughter, then whatever is left after her share; 
if the brother and siSter be from the same mother, then the one receives a sixth, as was stipulated at the 
beginning of the sura [Q. 4:11]. If there be two sisters, or more — for this was revealed regarding Jabir 
[b. ‘Abd Allah], who died and was survived by siSters —, theirs are two-thirds of what he, the brother, 
leaves; if there be, among the inheritors, siblings, men and women, then the male, among them, shall

the Prophet at the battle of Badr, but would participate in many later campaigns, including Uhud and al-Khandaq. According to 
some historical reports it was he who conquered Rayy in the year 24/644. What is certain is that he fought alongside ‘All at the 
battles of the Camel, Siffln and Nahrawan. He settled at Kufa and died at the time of the second civil war when Mus'ab b. al-Zubayr 
was in control of moSt of Iraq. Some 300 hadiths are attributed to him, although Bukhari relates only 15 of them, Muslim, 6; see

[5] al-Ma’ida 


Medinese: [consisting of] 120 verses, revealed after [surat] al-Fath. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","They ask you for a ruling. Say, “Allah gives you a ruling concerning the one leaving neither descendant nor ascendant as heir. If he dies leaving no child but a sister, she will get one-half of the inheritance. Likewise, he will inherit her if she dies leaving behind no descendant. If they are two sisters, they will share two-thirds of the inheritance. Should there be both male and female siblings, then the share of a male is equal to that of two females.”[114] Allah explains it clearly so that you do not fall into error. And Allah is All-Knowing of everything.",[114] This verse can be a prelude to the next surah which carries on explaining the laws and rules for the believing community in a greater detail.
5,1,2,"Oyou who believe, fulfil your bonds, the covenants confirmed between you and God and [between 
you and other] people. Lawful to you is the bead of the flocks, camels, cattle, and sheep [and goats], to 
eat after slaughtering [them], except that which is now being recited to you, as forbidden in [the verse 
below] Forbidden to you are carrion... [Q. 5:3]; the exceptive clause here is a discontinuous one, but may 
also be continuous; the forbidding concerns that which has succumbed to death and the like; game not 
being lawful to you when you are on pilgrimage ( hurum means muhrimun; ghayra, ‘not’, is in the ac¬ 
cusative as [it introduces] a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the pronoun lakum, ‘to 
you’). Verily, God decrees whatever He desires, in the way of making [things] lawful or otherwise, and 
there can be no objection thereto. O you who believe, do not profane God’s sacraments (sha’air is the plural of sha’ira), that is, 
the [ritual] ceremonies of the religion, by hunting [game] while you are on pilgrimage, nor the sacred 
month, by fighting in it, nor the offering, that is, the boon offered in the [Meccan] Sanctuary, by interfer¬ 
ing with it, nor the garlands (qalaid, is the plural of qilada, and these, made from the trees around the 
Sanctuary, were placed around it [the offering] to protedt it), in other words, do not interfere with these 
[offerings] or with those who place them; nor, violate the sandtity of, those repairing, those heading, to 
the Sacred House, by fighting them [who are], seeking bounty, provision ,from their Lord, through com¬ 
merce, and. His, beatitude, by resorting to Him, as they [the Meccans pagans] falsely claimed (this was 
abrogated by the baraa verse [of surat al-Tawba, Q. 9:4]). But when you are discharged, from pilgrimage 
inviolability, then hunt for game (a command denoting permission). And let not hatred (read shana’anu 
or shananu ) of a people that, because [they], barred you from the Sacred Mosque cause you to commit 
aggression, against them by killing them or otherwise. Help one another to righteousness, by doing that 
to which you were enjoined, and piety, by refraining from what you have been forbidden; do not help 
one another ( ta’dwanu: one of the two original fa’letters [in tata’awanu] has been omitted) to sin, adts of 
disobedience, and enmity, transgression of God’s bounds. And fear God, fear His punishment by being 
obedient to Him; surely God is severe in retribution, against those that oppose Him.","O you who believe, fulfill your covenants[1]. Lawful to you are all grazing livestock, except what is recited to you [in this Qur’an], as well as hunting while you are in the state of pilgrimage[2]. Allah ordains what He wills. . O you who believe, do not violate the sanctity of the rituals of Allah, nor of the sacred month[3], nor the sacrificial animals, nor the garlands[4], nor those [pilgrims] proceeding to the Sacred House seeking their Lord’s grace and pleasure. When your pilgrimage has ended, you may hunt. However, do not let the hatred of a people who barred you from the Sacred Mosque lead you to transgress. Cooperate with one another in goodness and righteousness, and do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah, for Allah is severe in punishment.","[1] i.e., pledges with Allah or human beings. [2] i.e., in the state of hajj or ‘umrah. .

 [4] Al-Qalā’id is hady (gifted offerings): garlands were put around the necks of unaccompanied offerings; hence, they were safe to roam and graze freely. [cf. Ibn Qutaybah, Gharīb al-Qur’ān; Ibn Fāris, Maqāyīs al-Lughah]."
5,3,3,"Forbidden to you is carrion, that is, the consumption of it, and blood, that is, what has been SJ)ilt, as 
mentioned in [surat] al-Anam [Q. 6:145], an d the flesh of swine, and what has been hallowed to other 
than God, in that it was sacrificed in the name of something other than Him, and the bead Strangled, to 
death, and the bead beaten down, to death, and the beadfallen, from a height to its death, and the bead 
gored, to death by another, and what beads of prey have devoured, of such animals — except for what 
you have sacrificed duly, catching it while it Still breathes life and then sacrificing it — and what has 
been sacrificed in, the name of, idols ( nusub is the plural of nusab) and that you apportion, that is, that 
you demand an oath or a ruling, through the divining of arrows ( azlam : the plural of zalam or zulam, 
which is a qidh, ‘a small arrow’, without feathers or a head). There were seven of these [arrows], [marked] 
with flags, and they were retained by the keeper of the Ka'ba. They would use them for abitrations and 
when they commanded them they obeyed, and if they prohibited them they would desist; that is wicked¬ 
ness, a rebellion against obedience. And on the Day of ‘ Arafa in the year of the Farewell Pilgrimage, the 
following was revealed: Today the disbelievers have despaired of your religion, of you apostatising from 
it, having hoped for it [earlier], for now they perceived its Strength; therefore do not fear them, but fear 
Me. Today I have perfeded your religion for you, that is, its rulings and obligations (after this [verse] 
nothing about [what is] lawful or unlawful was revealed) and I have completed My favour upon you, 
by perfecting it [your religion], but it is also said by [effecting] their safe entry into Mecca; and I have 
approved, chosen, Islam for you as religion. But whoever is condrained by emptiness, by hunger, to 
consume some of what has been forbidden him and consumes it, not inclining purposely to sin, to an aCt 
of disobedience — then God is Forgiving, to him for what he has consumed. Merciful, to him by permit¬ 
ting it to him, in contrast to the one who [purposely] inclines to sin, that is, the one actively engaged in 
it, such as a waylayer or a criminal, for whom [such] consumption is forbidden. 


Tafsir al-Jalalayn","Forbidden[5] to you are carrion, blood[6], the flesh of swine, and that which is sacrificed to other than Allah; and that which is killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by being gored; and that which is partly eaten by a predator unless you slaughter it [before it dies]; and that which is sacrificed to idols. Also it is forbidden to use arrows [of chance][7] to determine your decisions. This is all evil practice. Today the disbelievers have lost all hope in [eliminating] your religion, so do not fear them but fear Me. Today I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen Islam as your religion. But if anyone is compelled by severe hunger, not intending to sin, then Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","[5] See 2:173, 5:90.

 [7] Al-istiqsām bi al-azlām (lit. divining by casting lots): This was an Arab practice before Islam, whereby they had three lots (flat marked pieces of wood) dedicated to divinations. On each there was written either: “My Lord commanded me”, “My Lord forbade me”, or nothing at all. A person would abide by what the lot told him, but if he drew the empty one, he would recast again until he drew either one of the other two. [cf. al-Tabarī, Ibn Kathīr, al-Sa‘dī]"
5,4,5,"They will ask you, O Muhammad (s), about what, food, is made lawful for them. Say: ‘The good, 
delicious, things are made lawful for you; and the, quarry of, hunting creatures, dogs, wildcats or birds 
that catch food, you have taught, training [them] as hounds ( mukallibin is a circumstantial qualifi¬ 
er, derived from kallabtu al-kalba, meaning, ‘I released the hound against the quarry’) teaching them 
(tu allimunahunna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subjedt of mukallibin, ‘training [them] 
as hounds’, in other words, ‘disciplining them) of what God has taught you, of the art of hunting; so eat 
what they have caught for you, even if they have killed it, as long as they have not eaten any of it. This is 
in contrast to the untrained [hunting creatures], whose catch is not lawful [for consumption]: the mark 
of these [being trained hunting creatures] is that they should return after they have been sent out, that 
they can be curbed when cried at and that they can seize the quarry without eating of it; the minimum 
number of times by which this may be known is three. If they eat any of it, then it cannot be counted as 
‘what they have caught’ for their trainers, and is consequently unlawful for consumption, as reported in 
hadith in both of the Sahihs [of Bukhari and Muslim] — therein it is also mentioned that a catch made 
by an arrow over which God’s name is mentioned is equivalent [in lawfulness] to the catch of trained 
hunting creatures. And mention God’s name over it, when you unleash it. And fear God. Indeed, God 
is swift at the reckoning’. Today the good, the delicious, things are permitted to you, and the food of those who were given 
the Scripture, that is, animals slaughtered by the Jews and Christians, is permitted to you, and permitted 
to them is your food. Likewise, the believing, free, married women, and the married women of those 
who were given the Scripture before you, are permitted to you for marriage, if you give them their wages, 
their dowries, in wedlock, in marriage, and not illicitly, fornicating overtly with them, or taking them 
as lovers, so as to fornicate with them secretly. Whoever disbelieves in faith, that is, [whose] apostatises, 
his, prior good, work has indeed failed, and so it counts for nothing and he will not be rewarded for it, 
and in the Hereafter he shall be among the losers, if he dies in this State [of unbelief].","They ask you [O Prophet] what is lawful to them. Say, “All good things[8] are lawful for you, and that which is caught by your trained hunting animals and birds of prey[9], training them as Allah has taught you. Eat what they catch for you, but mention the name of Allah upon it.” And fear Allah, for Allah is swift in reckoning. . Today all good things have been made lawful to you. As the food of the people of the Book is lawful to you, and your food is lawful to them. And [it is lawful to marry] chaste believing women and chaste women from among those who were given the Book before you, provided that you give them their dowries[10] in honest wedlock, neither fornicating nor taking them as secret lovers. Whoever rejects the faith, all his efforts will be worthless and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers.","[8] All useful and enjoyable food that causes no harm to the body or the intellect.

State of] ritual impurity, wash your faces, and your hands up to the elbows, that is, including them [the 
elbows], as is clarified in the Sunna; and wipe your heads (the ba in bi-ru’usikum is for ‘adherence’), 
that is to say, wipe over [the head] adhering [the hand] closely, without [excessive] water pouring over; 
the noun [ra’s, ‘head’] is generic, and so the minimum required to fulfil [the Stipulation] is acceptable, 
which is the wiping of some of the hair, as al-Shafi‘1 asserts); and your feet (read wa-arjulakum in the 
accusative as a supplement to aydiyakum; or wa-arjulikum in the genitive because of its adjacency to 
[the genitive] bi-ru’usikum), up to the ankles, that is, including them [the ankles], as is clarified in the 
Sunna, and they are the two protruding bones at the juncture of the legs and the feet. The interposing of 
the wiping of the head between [the mention of] the hands and the feet, which are washed, is intended 
to show the requirement of [a Specific] order during the purification of these limbs, as al-ShafiT asserts. 
In addition, the requirement of making intention ( niyya ) in this [ablution], as in the other rituals of wor¬ 
ship, is taken from the Sunna. If you are defiled, purify, wash, yourselves; but if you are sick, with an 
illness made worse by water, or on a journey, travelling, or if any of you comes from the privy, that is, 
[if] he has defecated, or you have touched women (as mentioned already in the verse in [surat] al-Nisa 
[Q. 4:43]), and you cannot find water, having made the effort to look for it, then head for, seek, whole¬ 
some duSt, that is, clean earth, and wipe your faces and your hands, including the elbows, with it, using 
two strikes (the ba of bi-wujuhikum, ‘your faces’, denotes ‘adherence’; it is explained in the Sunna that 
the requirement here is for the wiping to encompass the whole of these two parts. God does not desire 
to make any hardship for you, any constraint, in the obligations He has imposed on you with regard to 
ablution, washing and purification with dusT; but He desires to purify you, of filth and sins, and that He 
may perfect His grace upon you, through Islam, by explaining the laws of the religion; so that you might 
give thanks, for His graces.","O you who believe, when you rise up for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands up to the elbows; wipe over your heads; and wash your feet up to the ankles. If you are in a state of major impurity, cleanse yourselves [by taking a bath]. But if you are ill, on a journey, or have relieved yourselves, or had sexual contact[11] with women and find no water, then purify yourselves with clean earth[12], and wipe your faces and hands therewith. Allah does not want to impose hardship on you, rather He wants to purify you and complete His favor upon you, so that you may be grateful.","[11] i.e., had sexual intercourse or seminal discharge.
 [12] This is the act of dry ablution or tayammum."
5,7,8,"And remember God’s grace upon you, through Islam, and His covenant. His pledge, which He 
made. He bound, with you when you said, to the Prophet (s) upon pledging allegiance to him: ‘We hear 
and we obey’, all that you command and forbid, of what we love and what we demise. And fear God, in 
His covenant, leSt you break it. Surely God knows what is in the breasts, that is, what is in the hearts [of 
people], all the more reason for [Him to have knowledge of] other things.

Sura al-Maida O you who believe, be upright before God, in [fulfilling] what is His due, witnesses in equity, in 
justice. Let not hatred of a people, namely, the disbelievers, cause you not to be juft, and to harm them 
on account of their enmity; be juft, towards both friend and foe, that, justice, is nearer to God-fearing. 
And fear God; surely God is aware of what you do, and will requite you for it.","Remember Allah’s favor upon you, and His covenant that He made with you when you said, “We hear and obey.” And fear Allah, for Allah is All-Knowing of what is in the hearts. . O you who believe, stand firm for Allah by bearing true testimony, and do not let the hatred of a people lead you away from justice. Be just; that is closer to righteousness. And fear Allah, for Allah is All-Aware of what you do.",
5,9,10,"God has promised those who believe and perform righteous deeds, an excellent promise: they shall 
have forgiveness and a great wage, that is, Paradise. And they who disbelieve and deny Our signs — they shall be the inhabitants of Hell-fire.","Allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have forgiveness and a great reward. . But those who disbelieve and reject Our verses, they are the people of the Blazing Fire.",

5,12,13,"God had made a covenant with the Children of Israel, for what will be mentioned shortly, and We 
raised up (there is a shift of address away from the third [to the firdtj person) from among them twelve 
leaders, from each tribe one leader, to be responsible for his people’s fulfilment of the covenant, as a way 
of binding them [to it] . And God said, to them: ‘I am with you, helping and assisting. Surely if (la-in, the 
lam is for oaths) you eftablish the prayer, and pay the alms, and believe in My messengers and succour 
them, help them, and lend to God a goodly loan, by expending in His way, I will absolve you of your 
evil deeds, and I will admit you to gardens underneath which rivers flow. So whoever of you disbelieves 
after that, covenant, surely he has ftrayed from the right way’, he has erred from the path to Paradise 
(al-sawa originally means ‘the middle way’). And they broke the covenant. God says: So because ( bi-ma, the ma is extra) of their breaking their covenant, We cursed them. 
We removed them from Our mercy, and made their hearts hard, unyielding to the acceptance of faith; 
they pervert words, pertaining to the descriptions of Muhammad (s) in the Torah and other things, from 
their contexts, those in which God has placed them, in other words, they substitute them; and they have 
forgotten, they have abandoned, a portion, a part, of what they were reminded of, [of what] they were 
enjoined to in the Torah, in the way of following Muhammad (s); and you — addressing the Prophet 
(s) now — will never cease to discover some treachery on their part, in the way of breaking a covenant 
or some other matter, except for a few of them, who have submitted themselves [to Islam]. Yet pardon 
them, and forgive; surely God loves the virtuous: this was abrogated by the ‘sword’ verse [Q. 9:5].","Allah took a covenant from the Children of Israel and appointed twelve chiefs from among them. Allah said, “I am with you. If you establish prayer, give zakah, believe in My messengers and support them, and give Allah a goodly loan[13], I will surely forgive your sins and admit you into gardens under which rivers flow. But whoever of you disbelieves after this has truly strayed from the straight path.” . As a result of their breaking of the covenant, We cursed them and made their hearts grow hard. They distort words [of the Scripture] from their context[14], and forgot parts of what was enjoined upon them. You will not cease to discover betrayal on their part except for a few. So pardon them and overlook, for Allah loves those who do good.","[13] By spending in Allah’s cause, seeking His reward. . [14] Concerning the coming of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) in the Torah."

this.","And from among those who say, “We are Christians,” We took a covenant from them, but they forgot a part of what was enjoined upon them[15].

5,15,17,"O People of the Scripture, Jews and Christians, now there has come to you Our Messenger, 
Muhammad (s), making clear to you much of what you used to conceal of the Scripture, the Torah and 
the GoSpel, such as the ‘Stoning’ verse and the description [of the Prophet Muhammad (s)], and pardon¬ 
ing much, of it, which he does not reveal, since this would not be of any benefit, serving only to disgrace 
you. There has verily come to you from God a light, namely, the Prophet (s), and a Book, a Qur’an, lucid, 
plain and manifest, whereby, that is, the Book by which, God guides whoever follows His good pleasure, by believing, 
to the ways of peace, the paths of safety, and brings them forth from the shadows, [from] unbelief, into 
the light, [into] belief, by His leave, by His will, and He guides them to a Straight path, the religion of

[who then can] defend, against, the chastisement of, God if He desires to destroy the Messiah, son of 
Mary, and his mother, and all those who are on earth?’, that is to say, none can do anything of the sort, 
since if Jesus were a god, he would be able to do so. And to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens 
and the earth, and all that is between them. He creates what He will. God has power over everything, 
which He wills.","O People of the Book, there has come to you Our Messenger, revealing to you much of what you have been concealing of the Scripture, and overlooking much[17]. There has surely come to you from Allah a light and a clear Book, . through which Allah guides those who seek His pleasure to the ways of peace[18], and brings them out of the depths of darkness to the light by His Will, and guides them to a straight path. . Those who say, “Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary,” have certainly disbelieved[19]. Say, “Who has the power to prevent Allah, if He chose to destroy the Messiah, son of Mary, his mother, and all those who are on earth?” To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth and everything between them. He creates what He wills, and Allah is Most Capable of all things.","[17] Of your sin in this regard. .

in terms of closeness and rank, and He is like a father to us in terms of compassion and care, and His 
beloved ones’. Say, to them, O Muhammad (s): ‘Why then does He chaftise you for your sins?, if what 
you say is true. For, the father does not punish his son, nor the loving his beloved; but He has punished 
you, and therefore you are saying lies. Nay; you are mortals from among, all, those, mortals, He created,

can be no objection thereto. For to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth, and all 
that is between them; to Him is the journey’s end, the [final] return. O People of the Scripture, there has verily come to you Our Messenger, Muhammad (s), making 
clear to you, the laws of religion, after an interval between the messengers, for there was no messenger 
between him and Jesus, an interval of 569 years; left you should say, if you are punished: ‘There has not 
come to us any bearer of good tidings (min bashir, the min is extra) nor any Warner’. Indeed, there has 
come to you a bearer of good tidings and a Warner, and so you shall have no excuse. God has power over 
all things, including punishing you for not following him [the Messenger].","The Jews and Christians say, “We are Allah’s children and His beloved ones.” Say, “Why then does He punish you for your sins? Rather, you are humans just like anyone else He created. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills.” To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth and all that is between them, and to Him is the final return.” . O People of the Book, there has come to you Our Messenger[20], making things clear to you, after an interval between the messengers, so you do not say, “No bearer of glad tidings or a warner has ever come to us.” Now there has come to you a bearer of glad tidings and a warner.

5,20,26,"And, mention, when Moses said to his people, ‘O my people, remember God’s favour to you, when 
He established among you, that is, from among you, prophets, and established you as kings, possessing 
servants and retinues, and gave you such as He had not given to any in all the worlds, in the way of 
manna and quails, the parting of the sea and other things. O my people, enter the Holy, the purified, Land which God has ordained for you, [which] He 
commanded you to enter, and this is Syria ( al-sham ), and do not turn back inflight, [do not] retreat in 
fear of the enemy, or you will end up as losers’, in your efforts. They said, ‘O Moses, there are giants in it, those remaining of the people of ‘Ad, who were very tall 
and mighty; we will never enter it until they depart from it; if they depart from it then we will enter’, it. There said, to them, two men of those who feared, contravening Gods command, and these were 
Joshua and Caleb — who were from among the leaders that Moses dispatched to bring back news of 
those giants — to whom God had been gracious, by making them virtuous, for they concealed what they 
had discovered about the giants, telling only Moses, unlike the other leaders, who divulged the news, and 
so the people became cowardly. ‘Enter againSt them by the gate!, the gate of the town, and have no fear 
of them, for they are bodies without hearts. For if you enter by it, you will be victorious-, the two [Joshua 
and Caleb] said this because they were certain of God’s assistance and the fulfilment of His promise. Put 
your truSt in God, if you are believers’. They said, ‘O Moses, we will never enter it so long as they are in it. So go forth, you and your 
Lord, and fight, them, we will be sitting here’, away from the fighting. He, Moses, thereupon, said, ‘My Lord, I control none but myself and my brother, and I control no 
one else to be able to force them to obedience. So separate, distinguish, us from the wicked folk’. He, God, exalted be He, said, to him: ‘Then it, the Holy Land, shall be forbidden them, to enter, 
for forty years; they shall wander loft, bewildered, in the land — according to Ibn ‘Abbas this [land] was 
about nine parasangs [sc. 30 miles]; so do not grieve for the wicked folk’. It is reported that they would 
travel throughout the night earnestly, but in the morning would find themselves back where they had 
Started. And they would travel all day, with the same result, until they all perished, except those under

twenty years of age. It is said that they numbered 600,000. Moses and Aaron died in the wilderness, and 
this was a mercy for them, and a chastisement for those others. When Moses was on the verge of death, 
he asked his Lord to bring him close to the Holy Land, to within a Stones throw, and He did, as related 
in hadith. Joshua became a prophet sometime after his fortieth year and he was commanded to fight 
againSt the giants. So he sallied forth with those that remained by his side and he fought againSt them; it 
was a Friday and the sun Stopped for him for an hour, until he had finished with fighting them. Ahmad 
[b. Hanbal] reported in his Musnad the [following] hadith, ‘The sun was never detained for any human, 
except for Joshua during those days in which he marched towards the Holy House [of Jerusalem]’.","And [remember] when Moses said to his people, “O my people, remember the favor of Allah upon you when He appointed prophets from among you, made you sovereigns[21], and gave you[22] what He had not given any other people in the world. . O my people, enter the Holy Land[23] which Allah has ordained for you and do not turn back or else you will return as losers.” . They said, “O Moses, there is an extremely mighty people in this land; we will never enter it until they leave it. Then if they leave, only then we will enter.” . Two men who feared Allah, and who had been favored by Allah said, “Enter upon them through the gate! Once you enter it, you will surely be victorious. And put your trust in Allah, if you are believers.” . They said, “O Moses, we will never enter it as long as they are there. Go, you and your Lord, and fight; we are staying right here!” . He said, “O my Lord, I have no control over anyone except myself and my brother, so separate us from these rebellious people.” . [Allah] said, “Then this land will be forbidden to them for forty years, while they will be straying through the land. Therefore, do not grieve[24] over the rebellious people.”","[21] Mulūk (lit. kings) could mean: 1. masters served on by others; 2. some were made sovereigns who ruled over people; 3. granted their freedom after being slaves.

5,27,31,"And recite, O Muhammad (s), to them, your people, the ftory, the tale, of the two sons of Adam, 
Abel and Cain, truthfully ( bi’l-haqq is semantically connected to utlu, ‘recite’), how they each offered a 
sacrifice, to God, which in Abel’s case was a ram, and in Cain’s, some green crops, and it was accepted 
from one of them, namely, from Abel, when a fire came down from the heaven and consumed his offer¬ 
ing, and not accepted from the other, that is, from Cain, and so he became furious and kept secret his 
envy until Adam left on pilgrimage. He said, to him, ‘I will surely slay you,’, and the other said, ‘Why?’, 
to which the firSt replied, ‘Because only your offering was accepted’. The other said, ‘God accepts only 
from the God-fearing’. ‘Yet if (la-in, the lam is for oaths) you extend your hand againft me to slay me, I will not extend 
my hand against you to slay you; I fear God, the Lord of the Worlds, in slaying you. I desire that you should end up with my sin, the sin of slaying me, and your own sin, the one that 
you had committed before, and so become an inhabitant of the Fire, whereas I do not want to end up 
with your sin if I were to slay you, and become one of them. God, exalted be He, says: that is the requital 
of the evildoers’. Then his sold prompted him, it seduced him, to slay his brother, so he slew him and became one 
of the losers, by slaying him. And he did not know what to do with him, because he was the firSt of the 
Children of Adam to die on earth, and so he carried him on his back. Then God sent forth a raven, scratching into the earth, digging up the soil with its beak and with 
its legs and throwing it up over a dead raven next to it until it completely hid it, to show him how he 
might hide the nakedness, the carcass, of his brother. He said, ‘Woe to me! Am I not able to be as this 
raven, and so hide my brother’s nakedness?’ And he became one of the remorseful, for having carried 
him; he then dug [a hole] for him and covered him up.","Relate to them the story of the two sons of Adam in truth, when both offered a sacrifice; it was accepted from one [i.e., Abel] but not accepted from the other [i.e., Cain][25]. The latter said, “I will kill you.” The former said, “Allah only accepts from those who fear Him. . Even if you stretch your hand forward to kill me, I will not stretch my hand forward to kill you, for I fear Allah, the Lord of the worlds. . I would rather let you bear your sin against me[26] and your own sin, and thus you will be one of the people of the Fire; such is the recompense of the wrongdoers.” . But the former justified to himself the killing of his brother and killed him, and thus became one of the losers. . Then Allah sent a crow scratching the ground[27] to show him how to bury the corpse of his brother. He said, “Woe to me! Have I failed even to be like this crow to bury the corpse of my brother?” And he became one of the remorseful.","[25] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “No soul ever gets killed unjustifiably, unless the early son of Adam (Cain) gets some of the burden of its blood, for he was the first human to spill blood”. [Al-Bukhārī: 3335, Muslim: 1677] . [26] The sin of killing me. . [27] It is said that this raven was burying another of its kind."
5,32,34,"Because of that, which Cain did, We decreed for the Children of Israel that whoever slays a soul 
for other than a soul, slain, or for, other than, corruption, committed, in the land, in the way of unbelief, 
fornication or waylaying and the like, it shall be as if he had slain mankind altogether; and whoever 
saves the life of one, by refraining from slaying, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind — 
Ibn ‘Abbas said [that the above is meant] in the sense of violating and protecting its [a soul’s] sanCtity 
[respectively]. Our messengers have already come to them, that is, to the Children of Israel, with clear 
proofs, miracles, but after that many of them Ttill commit excesses in the land, overstepping the bounds 
through disbelief, killing and the like. The following was revealed when the ‘Arniyyun came to Medina suffering from some illness, and 
the Prophet (s) gave them permission to go and drink from the camels’ urine and milk. Once they felt 
well they slew the Prophet’s shepherd and Stole the herd of camels: Truly the only requital of those who 
fight again ft God and His Messenger, by fighting againSt Muslims, and haften about the earth to do cor¬ 
ruption there, by waylaying, is that they shall be slaughtered, or crucified, or have their hands and feet 
cut off on opposite sides, that is, their right hands and left feet, or be banished from the land (the aw, ‘or’, 
is [used] to indicate the [separate] application of [each of] the cases [listed]; thus, death is for those that 
have only killed; crucifixion is for those that have killed and Stolen property; the cutting off [of limbs on 
opposite sides] is for those that have Stolen property but have not killed; while banishment is for those 
that pose a threat — this was Stated by Ibn ‘Abbas and is the opinion of al-Shafi‘1; the more sound of his 
[al-ShafiTs] two opinions is that crucifixion should be for three days after [the] death [of the killer], or.

Tafsir al-Jalalayn 

it is also said, shortly before [he is killed]; with banishment are included similar punishments, such as 
imprisonment and the like). That, mentioned requital, is a degradation, a humiliation, for them in this 
world; and in the Hereafter theirs will be a great chastisement, namely, the chastisement of the Fire. Except for such, warmongers and waylayers, as repent before you overpower them; for know that 
God is Forgiving, to them of what they have done, Merciful, to them. This [proviso] is expressed without 
any Statement to the effecft ‘do not submit them to prescribed legal punishment’, to point out that when 
such a person repents only God’s prescribed punishments ( hudud ) — and not those deriving from the 
rights of human beings — are waived. This is how I see it. I do not know of any that have tackled this 
[topic], and God knows beSt. If, then, a person has killed and Stolen property, he should be killed and 
have his limbs cut off [on opposite sides], but not crucified — this is the more sound of two opinions held 
by al-Shafi'I. However, his repentance is of no avail, once he has been overpowered [by the authorities] 
— this is also the more sound of two opinions held by him.","For this reason, We ordained for the Children of Israel that whoever kills a person – unless in retribution for murder or corruption in the land – it is as if he killed all mankind[28]; and whoever saves a life, it is as if he saved the life of all mankind. Our messengers came to them with clear signs, yet many of them continued to exceed the limits[29] afterward in the land. . The penalty[30] for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and spread corruption in the land[31], is that they should be executed, or crucified, or their hands and feet amputated on opposite sides, or banished from the land[32]. This is a disgrace for them in this world, and for them in the Hereafter, there will be a great punishment. . Except those who repent before you seize them; in that case, then know that Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","[28] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ""The biggest of sins are: (1) To associate partners with Allah, (2) to murder a human being, (3) to be undutiful to one’s parents (4) and to give a false testimony"" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 10]

forgives, him for, whom He wills, forgiveness, and God has power over all things, including chastising

to you: these were the inhabitants of Khaybar, among whom two married persons committed adultery, 
but whom they did not want to Stone. And so they dispatched [men from] Qurayza to ask the Prophet 
(s') about the ruling concerning the two; perverting words, that are in the Torah, such as the ‘Atoning’ 
verse, from their contexts, [the contexts] in which God had placed them, that is to say, substituting 
them, saying, to the ones they dispatched: ‘If you are given this, distorted ruling, that is, flogging, which 
Muhammad (s) has pronounced for you as a ruling, then take it, accept it; but if you are not given it, and 
he pronounces some other ruling for you, then beware!’, of accepting it! Whomever God desires to try, 
to lead aStray, you cannot avail him anything against God, by preventing such [a trial]. Those are they 
whose hearts God did not desire to purify, of unbelief, for had He desired it, you would have [been able 
to do something for them]; theirs shall be degradation in this world, humiliation, by being disgraced 
and subjected to th ejizya, and in the Hereafter theirs shall be a great chastisement. They are, listeners to calumny and consumers of unlawful gain (read suhut or suht), that which 
is illicit, such as bribes. If they come to you, to judge between them, then judge between them or turn 
away from them: the [second] option given here was abrogated by His saying, So judge between them 
[to the end of] the verse [Q. 5:48]. Therefore, we [Muslims] are obliged to judge between them if they 
requeSt arbitration before us — and this is the more sound of al-ShaflTs two opinions. If their request 
for arbitration involves a Muslim, however, then we are obliged to judge according to the consensus [of 
legal scholars and not juSt al-Shafi'Tj); if you turn away from them, they cannot harm you at all; and 
if you judge, between them, then judge juStly between them; God loves thejuSt, those that judge fairly, 
meaning that He will reward them. But how is it that they make you their judge when they have the Torah, wherein is God’s judge¬ 
ment, of Stoning: the interrogative here is for [provoking] amazement, in other words, they were not 
seeking thereby [by making you their judge] to discover the truth but a lighter punishment for them; and 
then they turn away, [and then] they rejedt your ruling of Stoning, which accords with what is in their 
Scripture, after that, requeSt [to you] for arbitration? Such are not believers.","O Messenger, do not grieve for those who rush to disbelief – those who say with their mouths, “We believe”, but their hearts have no faith, nor those Jews who eagerly listen to falsehood and to those who have not yet come to you[36]. They distort the words [of Allah] out of their context saying, “If you are given this [ruling] accept it[37], but if you are not given, then beware[38].” Whoever Allah wills to be misguided[39], there is nothing you can do to avail him against Allah. They are those whose hearts Allah did not will to purify. For them there is disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter they will suffer a great punishment. . They eagerly listen to lies and consume unlawful gains. If they come to you [O Prophet], either judge between them or turn away from them. If you turn away from them, they cannot harm you in the least. But if you judge, then judge between them with justice, for Allah loves those who are just. . But how is it that they seek your judgment when they have the Torah which contains Allah’s judgment, and they still turn away? Such people are not believers.","[36] They had not attended the Prophet's gatherings or heard his words.
 [37] The legal ruling desired by them.
 [38] They heed the words of warning of other conniving men who were so averse that they did not go to the Prophet (ﷺ) to hear what he had to say.
 [39] The meaning here is misbelief, misconception, or self-delusion as a result of one's own refusal of truth."
5,44,47,"Surely We revealed the Torah, wherein is guidance, from error, and light, that is, an exposition 
of the rulings, by which the prophets, from the Children of Israel, who had submitted, [who] had been 
compliant before God, judged for those of Jewry, as did the rabbis, the scholars among them, and the 
prieSts, the jurists, according to, because of, that which they were bidden to observe, [that which] was 
entrusted to them, that is to say, [that which] God bid them to observe, of God’s Scripture, leSt they 
change it, and were witnesses to, its truth. So do not fear men, O Jews, in disclosing what you have per¬ 
taining to the descriptions of Muhammad (s), the ‘Stoning’ verse and otherwise; but fear Me, when you 
conceal it; and do not sell, do not exchange. My signs for a small price, of this world, which you take in 
return for concealing them. Whoever does not judge according to what God has revealed — such are 
the disbelievers, in it. And therein, in the Torah, We prescribed. We made obligatory, for them that a life, be slain in 
return, for a life, if it has slain one; and an eye, should be gouged out, for an eye, and a nose, is to be 
cut off, for a nose, and an ear, is to be amputated, for an ear, and a tooth, should be pulled out, for a 
tooth (a variant reading has the laSt four [nouns] in the nominative); and for wounds (read wa’l-juruhu 
or wa’l-juruha ) retaliation, that is, the person is entitled to retaliate if this is feasible, as in the case of 
a hand or a leg; but in cases where one is not able to [retaliate], this is left to arbitration. Although this 
stipulation was prescribed for them, it is established in our Law; but whoever forgoes it, that is, retalia¬ 
tion, out of charity, able to restrain himself, then that shall be an expiation for him, of what he has done 
[of other sins]. Whoever does not judge according to what God has revealed, in the matter of retaliation 
and otherwise, those are the evildoers. And We caused Jesus son of Mary to follow in their, that is, the prophets’, footsteps, confirming 
the Torah before him; and We gave to him the Gospel, wherein is guidance, from error, and light, an 
exposition of the rulings, confirming ( musaddiqan is a circumstantial qualifier) the Torah before it, the 
rulings contained therein, and as a guidance and an admonition to the God-fearing. We said: So let the People of the Gospel judge according to what God has revealed therein, of

rulings (a variant reading of wa’l-yahkum, ‘let [them] judge’, is wa-li-yahkuma, making it a supplement 
to that which is governed by the previous verb [ataynahu, ‘We gave to him’]). Whoever does not judge 
according to what God has revealed — those are the wicked.","We sent down the Torah which contains guidance and light; the prophets who submitted themselves to Allah were judging by it for the Jews, and so did the rabbis[40] and scholars because they were entrusted to protect the Scripture of Allah, and they were witnesses to it. So do not fear people but fear Me, and do not trade My verses for a small price[41]. Whoever does not judge according to what Allah has revealed, it is they who are the disbelievers. . We ordained for them therein, “A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and for wounds equal retaliation[42].” But if anyone waives it charitably, then it will be an expiation for him[43]. Whoever does not judge according to what Allah has revealed, it is they who are the wrongdoers. . And in their footsteps[44] We sent Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah that came before him, and We gave him the Gospel that contained guidance and light, confirming what came before it in the Torah; and guidance and admonition for the righteous. . Let the people of the Gospel judge according to what Allah has revealed therein. Whoever does not judge according to what Allah has revealed, it is they who are the rebellious.","[40] Al-Rabbāniyyūn (sing. rabbānī) are men of extensive knowledge, both religious and worldly. This includes the wise scholar, the mindful jurisprudent, the reforming teacher, and the person who enjoins others to uphold the teachings of religion.
 [41] The guardians of Divine law should bear the fear of Allah first and foremost and not that of fellow men, nor are they to be swayed by bribes and worldly gains. . [42] This verse alludes to the law known as ""lex talionis"" (law of retaliation/reciprocal justice) which states that justice should be carried out: ‘ayin tachat ‘ayin, “an eye for an eye”, as told in the Torah (Exodus 21: 24) but which was distorted from its proper, fully-known position. The Qur’an re-establishes this principle.

is semantically connected to anzalna, ‘We have revealed’) confirming the Book that was before it and 
watching over it, testifying [to it] — the ‘Book’ means the Scriptures. So judge between them, between 
the People of the Scripture, if they take their cases before you, according to what God has revealed, to 
you, and do not follow their whims, deviating, away from the truth that has come to you. To every one 
of you, O communities, We have appointed a divine law and a way, a clear path in religion, for them 
to proceed along. If God had willed, He would have made you one community, following one Law, but. 
He separated you one from the other, that He may try you in what He has given to you, of the differing 
Laws, in order to see who among you is obedient and who is disobedient. So vie with one another in 
good works. Strive hastily thereunto; to God you shall all return, through resurrection, and He will then 
inform you of that in which you differed, in the matter of religion, and requite each of you according to 
his deeds. And judge between them according to what God has revealed, and do not follow their whims,

desires to smite them, with punishment in this world, for some of their sins, [those] which they have 
committed, among them, their turning away, and [that He desires] to requite them for all of their sins in 
the Hereafter; surely, many of mankind are wicked. Do they desire ( yabghun, is also read tabghun, ‘[do] you desire?’), [do] they seek, the judgement 
of paganism, through their deceit and deviation when they turn away? (this is an interrogative meant as 
a disavowal). Yet who, that is, no one, is better in judgement than God for a people knowing. Him, with 
certainty? These [people] are singled out for mention because they are the ones who refled.","We have revealed to you [O Prophet] the Book in truth, confirming the scriptures that came before it and as a criterion[45] over them. So judge between them according to what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires in disregard of the truth that has come to you. To each of you We have ordained a law and a way of life[46]. If Allah had willed, He would have made you a single community, but He tests you in what He has given you. So compete with one another in doing good deeds. To Allah you will all return, then He will inform you concerning things over which you used to differ. . And judge between them [O Prophet] according to what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires. And beware of them, lest they entice you away from some of what Allah has sent down to you. If they turn away, then know that it is Allah’s will to punish them for some of their sins, and many people are indeed rebellious. . Do they seek the judgment of the times of ignorance[47]? Who could be better than Allah in judgment for people who are certain in faith?","[45] Muhaymin: that which testifies the truth therein and falsifies the falsehood added to them.
 [46] A fact borne out by millennia that non-Muslim societies (known as dhimmiyyūn) lived and prospered in peace amidst Muslim communities and states. However, the law (shir‘ah) and way of life (minhāj) are different, yet the divinely ordained religion is, in essence, the same. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Prophets are half brothers; their mothers are different but their religion is the same.” [Al-Bukhārī: 3443, Muslim: 2365] . [47] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ""The most hated persons to Allah are three: [among them is] a person who wants that the traditions of the pre-Islamic period of ignorance should remain in Islam.""

reproacher, therein, in the way that the hypocrites fear the reproach of the disbelievers. That, description 
mentioned, is God’s bounty; He gives it to whom He will; and God is Embracing, of abundant bounty, 
Knowing, of those who deserve it. When [ ! Abd Allah] Ibn Salam said, ‘O Messenger of God, our people have shunned us’, the follow¬

and pay the alms, bowing down, humble, or performing voluntary prayers. Whoever affiliates to God and His Messenger and the believers. He will help them and assist 
them; for verily the party of God, they are the vidors, because of His assistance to them (He has made 
this [hizb Allah, ‘the party of God’] to fall in the place of [an implied] fa-innahum, ‘for verily they’, as an 
explication, since they belong to His party, that is, [they] His followers).","O you who believe, Whoever among you renounces his faith, Allah will bring a people whom He loves and who love Him.

do you believe in?’, and he replied: in God and in that which has been revealed to us [Q. 2:136], and when 
he mentioned Jesus they said, ‘We know of no religion worse than yours!’ Say: ‘O People of the Scrip¬

been revealed to us, and what was revealed, to the prophets, before, and that moSt of you are wicked?’

repudiate, in facft, is our faith and your opposition [to it], in refusing to accept it — [a refusal] which is 
described as ‘wickedness’, [this wickedness] itself being the necessary consequence of such [a refusal] —

you are spiteful, by way of reward, requital, from God? They are, those whom God has cursed, [whom] 
He has removed from His mercy, and with whom He is wroth, and some of whom He has turned into 
apes and swine, by transformation, and, those who, worship the false deity, Satan, by obeying him (the 
particle minhum, ‘some of whom, takes into account the [potentially plural] import of the particle min, 
‘[those] whom, and in what precedes [minhum, ‘some of whom’], the [singular] form [of min is taken

their saying, ‘We know of no religion worse [ sharrun ] than yours’.","Say, “O People of the Book, do you resent us only because we believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us and what was sent down before, and that most of you are rebellious?” .

the import that needs to be translated, the English above reads in the plural. In the Arabic, no distinction needs to be made between

theirs, which they have been committing. Why do the rabbis and the priests, among them, not forbid them from uttering sin, calumny, and 
consuming unlawful gain? Evil is what they have been doing, in refraining from forbidding them. The Jews said, when their circumstances became Straitened, on account of their denial of the 
Prophet (s), after having been the wealthiest of people: ‘God’s hand is fettered’, withholding the sending 
forth of provision upon us — this was their metaphor for niggardliness — may God be exalted above 
this. God, exalted be He, says: Fettered be, withheld be, their hands, from the performance of good 
deeds, as an invocation againSt them; and they are cursed for what they have said. Nay, but His hands 
are extended out wide — a hyperbole for the attribute of generosity — the use of [yadd] the dual for yad, 
‘hand’, is intended to imply abundance, since the utmoSt that an affluent person can give freely of his 
wealth is when he gives it with both hands. He expends how He will, in giving abundantly or Straitening, 
and there can be no objection to this. And what has been revealed to you from your Lord, of the Qur’an, 
will surely increase many of them in insolence and disbelief, because of their [very] disbelief in it; and 
We have cast between them enmity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection, and so every secft among 
them is opposed to the other. Every time they light the fires of war, that is, for war againSt the Prophet 
(s), God extinguishes them, that is, every time they desire it [war], He repels them. And they hasten 
about the earth in corruption, that is, [they haSten about] corrupting, through acfts of disobedience, and 
God does not love corrupters, meaning that He will punish them.","When they come to you [believers] they say, “We believe”, but in fact they are committed to disbelief both prior to their coming and after their leaving, and Allah knows best what they conceal. . You see many of them rushing into sin and transgression, and consuming unlawful earnings. Terrible indeed is what they do! . Why is it that their rabbis and scholars do not forbid them from saying words of sin and consuming unlawful earnings? Terrible indeed is what they commit! . The Jews say, “Allah’s Hand is restrained.” Their hands have been restrained[53] and they have been cursed for what they say. Rather, His both Hands are wide open, spending as He pleases[54]. What has been sent down to you from your Lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief. We have cast among them animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindle the fire of war, Allah extinguishes it. They strive to spread corruption in the land, and Allah does not like those who spread corruption.","[53] Implying inability to give or stinginess.

you from people, who may try to kill you. The Prophet (s) used to have guards up until [the time that] 
this [verse] was revealed, then he said, ‘Depart, for God protects me now’, as reported by al-Hakim. God

We sent messengers to them. Every time a messenger came to them, from among them, with what their 
souls did not desire, in the way of truth, they denied it; some, of them, they denied, and some, of them, 
they slay, such as Zachariah and John (the use of [the present tense] yaqtulun, ‘they slay’, instead of [the 
perfect tense] qatalu is to narrate paSt events [as if in the present] and to conclude [in harmony with] the 
end-rhyme of the verses). And they thought, they presumed that, there would be no (read as an la takunu, where an has been 
softened; or read an la takuna, where it [an] requires a [following] subjunctive, that is to say, ‘that there 
would [not] befall [them]’) trial, a punishment against them, for their denial of the messengers and their 
slaying of them; and so they were wilfidly blind, to the truth and could not see it, and deaf, [unable] 
to hear it. Then God relented to them, when they repented, then they were wilfully blind and deaf, a 
second time, many of them ( kathirun minhum substitutes for the [third] person [‘they’]); and God sees 
what they do, and will requite them for it.","We took the covenant from the Children of Israel and sent them messengers. Every time there came to them a messenger with something that did not suit their desires, they denied some of them and murdered others. . They thought that there would be no consequences, so they became blind and deaf [to the truth]. Then Allah forgave them, but again many of them became blind and deaf. And Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.",
5,72,73,"They indeed are disbelievers those who say, ‘Indeed God is the Messiah, son of Mary’ (a similar 
verse has preceded [Q. 5:17]). For the Messiah said, to them, ‘O Children of Israel, worship God, my 
Lord and your Lord, for, I am a servant and not a god. Verily he who associates anything with God, in 
worship, for him God has made Paradise forbidden, He has forbidden him admittance to it, and his 
abode shall be the Fire; and for wrongdoers ( wa-ma li’l-zalimina min, the min is extra) there shall be no 
helpers’, to guard them against the chastisement of God. They are indeed disbelievers those who say, ‘God is the third of three’, gods, that is, He is one of 
them, the other two being Jesus and his mother, and they [who claim this] are a Christian secft; when 
there is no god but the One God. If they do not desist from what they say, when they declare a trinity, 
and profess His Oneness, those of them who disbelieve, that is, [those] who are fixed upon unbelief, shall 
suffer a painful chastisement, namely, the Fire.","They have certainly disbelieved, those who say, “Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary.” But the Messiah said, “O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord[56].” Whoever associates any partners with Allah, Allah has forbidden Paradise for him, and his abode will be the Fire. And the wrongdoers will have no helpers. . They have certainly disbelieved, those who say, “Allah is one of Three[57].” None has the right to be worshiped except One God. If they do not desist from saying this, those who disbelieve from among them will be afflicted with a painful punishment.","[56] This and the next verse addressed the Lordship and Divinity of Jesus. See 2:165. . [57] i.e., a part of the three, referring to the Christian concept of the Trinity."
5,74,77,"Will they not turn in repentance to God and seek His forgiveness?, for what they say (the inter¬ 
rogative is intended as a rebuke); God is Forgiving, to the one who repents, Merciful, to him. 77 ie Messiah, son of Mary, was only a messenger; messengers passed away before him, and so he 
passed away like them, for he is not a god as they claim, otherwise he would not have passed away; his 
mother was a truthful woman, [siddiqa means] extremely truthful; they both used to eat food, like all 
other human beings, and one who is such cannot be a god because of his compound being and fallible 
nature, and because of the [impurities such as] urine and excrement that he produces. Behold, in amaze¬ 
ment, how We make the signs, of Our Oneness, clear to them, then behold, how they are turned away!, 
[how] they are turned away from the truth deSjiite the proof being established. Say: ‘Do you worship besides God, that is, other than Him, what cannot hurt or profit you? God 
is the Hearer, of your sayings, the Knower’, of your circumstances (the interrogative is meant as a disa¬ 
vowal) . Say: ‘O People of the Scripture, Jews and Christians, do not go to extremes, do [not] overStep the 
bounds, in your religion, other than those, extremes, of truth, neither lowering nor elevating Jesus above 
his proper place, and do not follow the whims of a people who went aStray formerly, on account of their 
extremism — these were their forefathers — and have led many, [other] people, aStray, and Strayed 
from the even way’, from the path of truth (al-sawa’ originally means ‘middle’).","Why do they not turn to Allah in repentance and seek His forgiveness? For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. . The Messiah, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger. There were messengers who passed away before him, and His mother was a woman of truth; they both ate food[58]. See how We make Our signs clear to them, yet see how they are deluded! . Say, “Do you worship besides Allah that which can neither harm nor benefit you?! And Allah is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.” . Say, “O People of the Book, do not exceed the limits of the truth in your religion, nor follow the desires of people[59] who went astray before, and misled many and themselves strayed from the straight path.”","[58] They both were in need of sustenance, proving that they were not divine beings, unlike Allah Almighty Who is in no need of anything while everything is in need of Him. . [59] Their misguided and misguiding religious leaders."
5,78,81,"Cursed were the disbelievers of the Children of Israel by the tongue of David, when he invoked 
God againSt them and they were transformed into apes — these were the people of Eilat — and by Jesus, 
son of Mary, when he invoked God againSt them and they were transformed into pigs — they were the 
ones [who ate] at the Table [cf. Q. 5:115, below] — that, cursing, was because of their disobedience and 
their transgression. They did not prevent one another, that is, one would not forbid the other from committing again, any 
indecency that they committed; verily evil was what they used to do, [verily evil] was this deed of theirs. 


107 


Tafsir al-Jalalayn You, O Muhammad (s), see many of them affiliating with those who disbelieve, from among the 
Meccans, out of Spite for you. Evil is that, in the way of deeds, which their souls have offered on their 
behalf, for [the day of] their inevitable return, such that God is wroth with them and in the chastisement 
they shall abide. Yet had they believed in God and the Prophet, Muhammad (s), and what has been revealed to 
him, they would not have affiliated with them, namely, [with] the disbelievers; but many of them are 
wicked, rebellious against faith.","Those who disbelieved from the Children of Israel were cursed on the tongue of David and Jesus son of Mary. That was because of their disobedience and their persistence in transgression. . They did not forbid one another from committing evil deeds. Terrible was indeed what they used to do! . You see many of them taking those who disbelieve as allies. Terrible was indeed what they have done for themselves, for they have incurred Allah’s wrath and they will abide in the punishment forever. . If they had believed in Allah and the Prophet, and what has been sent down to him[60], they would not have taken them as allies, but most of them are evildoers.",[60] Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) and his message.
5,82,86,"You, O Muhammad (s), will truly find the moil hostile of people to those who believe to be the 
Jews and the idolaters, of Mecca, because of the intensity of their disbelief, ignorance and utter preoc¬ 
cupation with following whims; and you will truly find the nearest of them in love to those who believe 
to be those who say ‘Verily, we are Christians’; that, nearness of theirs in love to the believers is, because 
some of them are prieSts, scholars, and monks, devout worshippers, and because they are not disdain¬ 
ful, of following the truth, as the Jews and the Meccans are. This [verse] was revealed when the Negus’s delegation from Abyssinia came to him (s): when the 
Prophet (s) recited surat Yd Sin, they cried and submitted [to Islam], saying, ‘How similar this is to what 
used to be revealed to Jesus!’ God, exalted be He, says: And when they hear what has been revealed to 
the Messenger, of the Qur’an, you see their eyes overflow with tears because of what they recognise of 
the truth. They say, ‘Our Lord, we believe, we accept the truth of your Prophet and your Book, so in¬ 
scribe us among the witnesses, those who affirm their acceptance of the truth. And, in response to those Jews who reviled them for their Islam, they would say: why should we 
not believe in God and what has come to us of the truth, the Qur’an, that is to say, there is nothing to 
prevent us from faith when its prerequisites are present; and hope ( natmau is a supplement to nu’minu, 
‘we believe’) that our Lord should admit us with the righteous people?’, the believers, into Paradise? God, exalted be He, says: So God has rewarded them for what they have said with Gardens un¬ 
derneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide; that is the requital of those who are virtuous, by 
believing. But those who disbelieve and deny Our signs — they are the inhabitants of Hell-fire.","You will surely find that the most hostile people towards the believers are the Jews and those who associate partners with Allah, and you will surely find that the closest of them in affection to the believers are those who say, “We are Christians.” That is because among them are priests and monks[61], and they are not arrogant. . When they hear what has been sent down to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of recognizing the truth. They say, “Our Lord, we believe, so record us among those who testify [to the truth]. . Why should we not believe in Allah and the truth that has come to us? And we hope that our Lord will include us in the company of the righteous people.” . So Allah rewarded them for what they said with gardens under which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. Such is the reward of those who do good. . But those who disbelieve and reject Our signs, they are the people of the Blazing Fire.","[61] ""Priests"" are devoted to learning, while ""monks"" renounced the world and lead ascetical lives."
5,87,88,"When a number of Companions resolved to practise faffing and night vigil continuously, and to 
abstain from women, perfume, consumption of meat, and sleeping on beds, the following was revealed: 

O you who believe, do not forbid the good things that God has made lawful for you and do not trans¬ 
gress, do [not] exceed God’s command; God does not love transgressors. And eat of the lawful and good food which God has provided you ( halalan tayyiban, ‘lawful and 
good food’, is the direcft objedt and the preceding genitive construction [mimma, ‘of... which’] is a cir¬ 
cumstantial qualifier connected to the former); and fear God, in Whom you are believers.","O you who believe, do not prohibit the good things that Allah has made lawful for you[62], and do not exceed the limits, for Allah does not like those who exceed the limits. . Eat of the lawful and good things that Allah has provided for you, and fear Allah in Whom you believe.","[62] Anas ibn Mālik (رضي الله عنه) said about the three men who asked about the Prophet’s life, then one of them said: “I shall pray all night long and never sleep!” Another said: “I shall fast all year long and never break it!” And a third said: “I shall shun women and never ever marry!” The Prophet (ﷺ) condemned their actions and said: “Whoever renounces my way (Sunnah) has nothing to do with me!” [See: Al-Bukhārī: 5063, Muslim: 1401]"
5,89,89,"God will not take you to task for a slip, contained, in your oaths, which is what the tongue ut¬ 
ters Spontaneously, without intending to swear an oath, such as when one says, ‘No, by God’, or ‘Yes, by 
God’; but He will take you to task for that to which you have pledged (read ‘aqadtum, ‘aqqadttum or 
‘aqadttum ) oaths, where you have sworn an oath intentionally; the expiation thereof, of the oath if you 
break it, is the feeding often of the needy, for each needy person one mudd measure, of the midmott 
food, from which, you feed your families, that is, the closest or the principal [food you consume], neither 
better, nor worse; or the clothing of them, with what may be [properly] called clothes, such as a shirt, a 
turban, or a loin cloth — it is not sufficient that these [items] mentioned be given only to one needy per¬ 
son, according to al-Shafi'I; or the settingfree of a, believing, slave, as applies in the expiation for slaying 
or repudiation through zihar, interpreting the general [Stipulation] in a reStridted sense; and whoever 
does not find the means, for any one of the [expiations] mentioned, then the fatting of three days, as an 
expiation for him — as it appears [in this verse], it is not obligatory to follow the [above] sequence [of 
alternatives when making an expiation], and this is the opinion of al-Shafi‘I. That, which is mentioned, 


108 


Sura al-Maida 


is the expiation of your oaths if you have sworn, and have broken them; but keep your oaths, do not 
break them, unless it be for a righteous deed or setting right between people, as stated in the verse of 
surat al-Baqara [Q. 2:225]. So, in the same way that He has explained to you what has been mentioned, 
God makes clear to you His signs, so that you might be thankful, to Him for this.","Allah will not hold you accountable for your unintentional oaths[63], but He will hold you accountable for your deliberate oaths. The expiation thereof is to feed ten needy people from what you normally feed your own family, or to clothe them, or to emancipate a slave. However, if someone cannot afford it, then he must fast for three days. That is the expiation for breaking your oaths. But be mindful of your oaths[64]. This is how Allah makes His verses clear to you, so that you may be grateful.","[63] i.e., out of habit or without true intent.
 [64] i.e., do not swear much; do not swear while lying; honor your oaths."
5,90,93,"O you who believe, verily wine, that intoxicates and overcomes the mind, and games of chance, 
gambling, and idols, and divinatory arrows are an abomination, an evil deemed vile, of Satan’s work, 
which he adorns; so avoid it, this abomination consisting of the things mentioned, do not do it; so that 
you might prosper. Satan desires only to precipitate enmity and hatred between you through wine and games of 
chance, when you partake of them, because of the evil and discord that result therefrom; and to bar 
you, by your being preoccupied with them, from the remembrance of God and from prayer — He has 
Specifically mentioned it [prayer] so as to magnify it. So will you then desist?, from partaking of them? 
In other words: DesiSt! And obey God and obey the Messenger, and beware, of disobedient aCts; but if you turn away, 
from obedience, then know that Our Messenger’s duty is only to proclaim plainly, to convey clearly [the 
Message] — your requital falls on Us. Those who believe and perform righteous deeds are not at fault in what they may have con¬ 
sumed, of wine and [indulged in] of gambling before the prohibition, so long as they fear, the forbidden 
things, and believed and performed righteous deeds, and then were God-fearing and believed, [and 
then] adhered to fear of God and belief, and then were God-fearing and virtuous, in deeds; God loves 
the virtuous, meaning that He will reward them.","O you who believe, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters[65] and divining arrows are of Satan’s evil work; therefore avoid such [evil], so that you may be successful. . Satan only wants to create enmity and hatred between you through intoxicants and gambling, and to prevent you from remembering Allah and from prayer. Will you not then abstain? . Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and be cautious. But if you turn away, then know that the duty of Our Messenger is only to convey the message clearly. . There is no blame on those who believe and do righteous deeds for what they consumed before [its prohibition], so long as they fear Allah, believe and do righteous deeds, then they fear Allah [more] and believe, then they fear Allah and do good, for Allah loves those who do good.",[65] Ansāb are stones or idols that were erected for worship and sacrificial offerings.
5,94,95,"O you who believe, God will surely try you. He will surely teSt you, with some game, which He 
releases to you, the smaller of, which will be caught by your hands and, the larger of which by, your 
lances-, this was in [the plain of] al-Hudaybiyya; while they were in [the State of] pilgrimage inviolability, 
beaSts and birds would flock to their caravans; so that God may know, through knowledge outwardly 
manifested, who fears Him in the Unseen ( bi’l-ghayb is a circumstantial qualifier), in other words, while 
He is absent [to the eyes], one who does not see Him but nonetheless avoids hunting game. Whoever 
transgresses thereafter, after that prohibition againSt it, and hunts, his shall be a painful chastisement. O you who believe, do not slay game while you are in the State of pilgrimage inviolability, for the 
hajj or the ‘umra; whoever of you slays it wilfully, then the compensation shall be (read fa-jazaun, ‘then 
the compensation [shall be]’, followed by a nominative [mithlu, ‘the like of’]) that is to say, a compensa¬ 
tion is incumbent on him, and that is, the equivalent of what he has slain, of flocks, in other words, a 
similar creature (a variant reading has an annexation construction for jaza, ‘compensation, [sc. fa-jazau 
mithli, ‘then the compensation of’]), to be judged, that is, the equivalent [is to be judged], by two juSt 
men among you, both possessing astuteness, with which they are able to identify the nearest [animal] in 
equivalence to it [the slain animal]. Ibn ‘Abbas, ‘Umar and ‘All, may God be pleased with them, all ad¬ 
judged a beaSt of sacrifice [as redemption] for an oStrich [slain]; Ibn ‘Abbas and Abu ‘Ubayda adjudged 
a cow [as redemption] for wildebeeSt or wild ass; [‘Abd Allah] Ibn ‘Umar and [‘Abd al-Rahman] Ibn 
‘Awf, a sheep for a gazelle, and, as Ibn ‘Abbas, ‘Umar and others did, [a sheep] also [as a redemption] 
for [slaying] pigeons, because they [pigeons] resemble these [sheep] in taking scoops of water [when 
drinking ]; 3 an offering (hadyan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to jaza , compensation’) to reach 
the Ka c ba, that is, to be taken into the Sanctuary, sacrificed there and given as a voluntary offering to 
its needy [residents], and it cannot be sacrificed wherever [else] it may be ( baligha 1-ka‘ba, ‘to reach the 
Ka'ba, is in the accusative because it is an adjectival qualification of what precedes, even if it Stands as 
an annexation, since such an annexation is only morphological and not [valid] as a [grammatical] char¬ 
acterisation); if there is no equivalent beaSt of flock for the game slain, as in the case of a small bird or 
locuSts, then the person is obliged [to compensate] with [equivalent] value. Or, it is incumbent on him 

3 According to the Lisan, the expression ‘abba al-maa means to ‘take gulps of water’, as opposed to sipping it; the verb is used for 
pigeons exclusively among birds, since they are the only birds that take scoops of water, as do sheep.

Tafsir al-Jalalayn 

[to make], an expiation: other than compensation, and if he should find the means then this [expiation] 
is, food for the poor, [food] to be taken from the principal food of the town, equivalent to the value of the 
compensation, being one mudd measure for each poor person (a variant reading has kaffara, ‘expiation’, 
in an annexation with the following noun [sc. kaffaratu taamin, ‘the expiation of food’] as an explication 
[of kaffara, ‘expiation’]); or, it is incumbent on him [to compensate with], the equivalent of that, food, 
in fasting, so that he fails one day for every mudd measure [that he is unable to provide]; but if he has 
the means to [provide the food] then it is incumbent on him to do so, so that he may taSle the evil con¬ 
sequence, the burden of the compensation, of his deed, the one he has perpetrated. God has pardoned 
what is pail, of game slain before it was prohibited; but whoever offends again, God will take venge¬ 
ance on him; God is Mighty, His way will prevail, Lord of Retribution, against those who disobey Him. 
Unintentional slaying [of game] is also included with intentional slaying in what has been mentioned [of 
required compensation or expiation]. 4","O you who believe, Allah will surely test you with game within the reach of your hands and spears, so that Allah may distinguish those who fear Him unseen. Whoever transgresses after that, for him there will be a painful punishment. . O you who believe, do not kill game while you are on pilgrimage[66]. Whoever of you kills it deliberately should compensate by offering its equivalent – as judged by two just men among you – to be offered at the Sacred House, or by feeding the needy, or by fasting its equivalent, so that he may taste the consequence of his deed. Allah has pardoned what has passed, but whoever does it again, Allah will subject him to retribution, for Allah is All-Mighty, Capable of Retribution.",[66] See footnote above 5:1.
5,96,100,"Permitted to you, O people, be you in pilgrimage inviolability or not, is the game of the sea, for 
consumption, and it is what can only live in the sea, such as fish, but not what is able to live both in the 
sea and on land, such as crabs; and food from it, what it casts out that is dead, is a provision for you, for 
you to consume, and for the wayfarers, the travellers among you, to take as their provisions; but forbid¬ 
den to you is the hunting of game on the land, and this consists of those edible beasts that live on it; do 
not hunt them, so long as you remain in pilgrimage inviolability: if it is caught by one not in pilgrimage 
inviolability, then it is permissible for a person in pilgrimage inviolability to consume it, as is clarified in 
the Sunna; and fear God, to whom you shall be gathered. God has appointed the Ka c ba, the Sacred, inviolable, House as an [enduring] institution for 
mankind, [an institution] by which their religious affair is sustained, through pilgrimage to it, as is their 
this-worldly [affair], on account of the security [guaranteed] for those who enter it and the facft that they 
are not interfered with, and because all manner of fruits are brought to it (a variant reading [for qiyaman ] 
has qiyaman, ‘[always] Standing’, as the verbal noun from [1 41 form] qama, ‘to remain Standing’, without 
defecftiveness [of the middle radical]); and the sacred month, meaning the sacred months of Dhu’l- 
Qa'da, Dhu’l-Hijja, Muharram and Rajab, instituted for them to be secure from fighting during them; 
the offering and the garlands, instituted for their owner so that he does not suffer any interference; that, 
mentioned appointment, is so that you may know that God knows all that is in the heavens and in the 
earth, and that God has knowledge of all things: thus that appointing of His in order to secure benefits 
for you and to ward off harm from you, before such things came to pass, testifies to His knowledge of all 
that is in existence and all that will be. Know that God is severe in punishment, of His enemies, and that God is Forgiving, to His friends, 
Merciful, to them. The duty of the Messenger is only to convey [the Message], to you; and God knows what you 
reveal, what deeds you manifest, and what you hide, and what of these you conceal, and He will requite 
you for it. Say: ‘The evil, the unlawful, and the good, the lawful, are not equal, even though the abundance 
of the evil attrad you.’ So fear God, in avoiding it, O people of pith, so that you might prosper, triumph.","It is lawful for you to hunt and eat seafood, as a provision for you and for the travelers. But hunting land animals is forbidden to you as long as you are on pilgrimage. And fear Allah to Whom you will be gathered. . Allah has made the Ka‘bah, the Sacred House, a source of stability for people, and also the sacred month, the sacrificial animals and the garlands [by which they are identified]. This is so that you may know that Allah knows all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth, and that Allah is All-Knowing of everything. . Know that Allah is severe in punishment and that Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. . The Messenger’s duty is only to convey the message; Allah knows what you reveal and what you conceal. . Say, “Evil and good are not equal, even if the abundance of evil may impress you. So fear Allah, O people of understanding, so that you may be successful.”",
5,101,102,"The following was revealed when they began to ask the Prophet (s) too many questions: O you 
who believe, do not ask about things which, if disclosed to you, [if] revealed, would trouble you, be¬ 
cause of the hardship that would ensue from them; yet if you ask about them while the Qur’an is being 

4 The majority of scholars are of the opinion that the compensations and forms of expiation mentioned also apply to unintentional 
slaying of game during the Sate of ihram: one might hunt game with the intention of killing it, having forgotten that he or she is 
in a Sate of ihram. In fad, some contend that compensation and expiation do not apply to the one who slays game intentionally, 
fully aware of his Sate of ihram, since this is a clear and direct contravention of God’s ruling and such a person will be requited by 
God. As regards the wording of the Qur’anic verse, mutaammidan (‘wilfully’), again, the majority of scholars Sate that this quali¬ 
fication does not do away with the liability for damage caused by the slaying of game, which requires compensation in either case. 
Moreover, they add that the use of the term refers to the specific occasion upon which the verse was revealed, where the slaying of 
game at the hands of the individuals concerned was intentional. See al-Tabari’s discussion of this verse in his commentary ( Jdrni' 
al-bayan, Q. 5:95) for a detailed exposition of all of the above arguments.

Sura al-Maida 


revealed, during the time of the Prophet (s), they will be disclosed to you: meaning that if you ask about 
certain things during his lifetime, the Qur’an will reveal them, but once these things are disclosed, it will 
grieve you. So do not ask about them; indeed: God has pardoned those things, you asked about, so do 
not ask again;/or God is Forgiving, Forbearing. Verily a people before you asked about them, that is, [they asked] their prophets about such 
things and they received the response in the form of [revealed] explications of the rules concerning 
them; and then they disbelieved in them, by neglecting to implement them.","O you who believe, do not ask about things which, if they are made known to you, would only cause you hardship[67]. If you inquire about them while the Qur’an is being revealed, they will be made known to you. Allah has pardoned you for it. Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing. . Some people before you asked such questions, then became disbelievers as a result of that[68].","[67] i.e., especially contrived questions, if responded to will widen the circle of divine ordinances, which might cause difficulty for the believers to act on them. . [68] For not carrying out what they were commanded."
5,103,105,"God has not ordained. He has not stipulated [in His Law], anything such as a Bahira, a Sd’iba, 
a Wasila or a Ham, in the way that people did at the time of paganism. Al-Bukharl reported [in a hadith ] 
from Sa'Id b. al-Musayyab, 5 who said: ‘The bahira is that [camel] whose milk is consecrated to idols and 
whom no human may milk; the saiba is the one they would leave to roam freely for their gods and was 
forbidden to bear any load; the wasila is the young she-camel that would give birth to a young female, as 
its firSt offspring, followed by another female, bearing one after the other without a male in between: she 
would then be left to roam freely for their idols; the ham is the mature male camel, which after complet¬ 
ing a certain number of copulations with a female, would then be consigned to their idols and be exempt 
from bearing any load, and they would call it hami; but the disbelievers invent lies again & God, in this 
matter, by attributing [the sanctioning of] such [practices] to Him; and moil of them do not understand, 
that this is mendacity, for in this they have [merely] followed the example of their forefathers. And when it is said to them, ‘Come to what God has revealed and to the Messenger’, that is, to 
His ruling concerning the permitting of what you have forbidden, they say, ‘What we have found our 
fathers following suffices us’, in the way of religion and laws. God, exalted be He, says: What, does that 
suffice them, even if their fathers knew nothing and were not guided?, to any truth (the interrogative is 
meant as a disavowal). O you who believe, you are responsible for your own souls, in other words, preserve them and 
do what is in their besd interest; he who is aStray cannot hurt you, if you are rightly guided: it is said 
that this means, ‘None of those misguided ones from among the People of the Scripture can hurt you; it 
is also said to mean others, on the basis of the [following] hadith of Abu Tha'laba al-Khushanl: 6 ‘I asked 
the Messenger of God (s) about it [this verse] and he said, “Enjoin one other to decency and forbid one 
another indecency, and then if you see niggardliness being obeyed, whims being followed, this present 
world being preferred, and every intelligent person proud of his own opinions, then you are [ftill] re¬ 
sponsible for [looking after] your own soul”,’ as reported by al-Hakim and others. Unto God you shall 
return, all together, and He will inform you of what you used to do, and requite you for it.","Allah did not ordain any such thing as the Bahīrah, Sā’ibah, Wasīlah, and Hām [i.e., dedicated camels to idols][69]. Rather those who disbelieve fabricate lies against Allah, and most of them do not understand. .

5 Sa'Id b. al-Musayyab al-Qurashi al-Makhzuml (d. 94/713) was the most prominent of the Medinese traditionists of the Successor 
(tabi'un) generation. Although too young at the time of‘Umar’s caliphate, he would live to hear traditions from ‘Uthman b. ‘Affan, 
‘All b. Abi Talib and from other famous individuals such as Zayd b. Thabit, Abu Musa al-Ash'ari, Ibn ‘Abbas, Abu Hurayra and the 
Prophet’s wife ‘A’isha. He himself would later become an important source of hadith for transmitters such as al-Zuhri, Qatada, and 
‘Ami b. Dinar, amongst sundry others. A detailed prosopographical entry on him can be found in al-Dhahabi, Siyar, iv, 217-46.

was certainly a Companion and was remembered for being one of the many believers who gave the pledge of loyalty to the Prophet 
‘under the tree’ (Q. 48:18), the bay'at al-ridwdn, in the year in which the peace-treaty was concluded with the Meccan pagans at al- 
Hudaybiyya. Abu ThaTaba left the Hijaz to settle in Syria and died either in Mu‘awiya’s caliphate or in the year 75/694, during the 
caliphate of‘Abd al-Malikb. Marwan; see Dhahabi, Siyar, 11, 567-71; Ibn Hajar, Tahdhib, vi, 3i9f.; Ibn al-Athir, Usd, vi, 43b

God, both of them saying: ‘We will not sell it, [our testimony] in [swearing by] God, for any price, [for] 
any compensation that we might take in exchange for it from this world, neither by swearing by Him 
[falsely], nor by testifying falsely for the sake of that [price]; even if he, the person before whom it is be¬ 
ing sworn or the one for whose sake testimony is being given, be a near kinsman, a close relative of ours, 
nor will we hide testimony to God, which He has commanded us [to give], for then, if we were to hide it, 
we would surely be among the sinful’. But if it be discovered, [if] it be ascertained after they have sworn their oaths, that both of them 
have merited [the suspicion of] sin, that is, that they have done something to incur it, in the way of a 
breach of faith or perjury in the testimony; for example, if what they are accused of is found with them 
and then they claim that they had bought it from the deceased or that he had bequeathed it to them, 
then two others shall take their place, so that the oaths are to be taken from them, being the nearest 
( al-awlayan is a substitution for akharan, ‘two others’; a variant reading has al-awwalin, plural of awwal, 
as an adjectival qualification of, or a substitution for, alladhina, ‘of those’), in kinship to the deceased, 
of those mo ft concerned, with the bequeSt, namely, the inheritors, and they shall swear by God, to the 
breach of faith of the two witnesses, and they shall both say, ‘Verily, our testimony, our oath, is truer, is 
more faithful, than their testimony, their oath, and we have not transgressed, we have [not] overstepped 
the [bounds of] truth in our oaths, for then we would assuredly be among the evildoers’: meaning, let 
the one about to die call two men as witnesses to his bequeSt, or let him inStrudt in his bequeSt that 
the two be from among his co-religioniSts or from among others, if he cannot find any [from among 
the former] because he is travelling or for some similar reason. If the inheritors have doubts about the 
two men and claim a breach of faith on the part of the two for having taken something or given it to 
some other person — alleging that the deceased bequeathed it to him — then let the two men swear in 
full [in the way mentioned above]. If then some indication surfaces that the two men have been lying 
and these two then claim some motivation for this adtion [of theirs], the nearest of the inheritors in 
kinship [to the deceased] shall swear to the perjury of the two men and to the truth of what they [the 
inheritors] suseeded. This stipulation holds for the two trustees, but is abrogated in the case of the two 
witnesses. Likewise, the testimony of non co-religioniSts is abrogated. The reason for [Stipulating] the 
mid-afternoon prayer is to consecrate the oaths. The Specification in this verse that the oath be from the 
two inheritors nearest in kinship concerns the incident regarding which it was revealed. This [incident], 
as reported by al-Bukharl, involved a man from the Banu Sahm who had set out on a journey with 
Tamim al-Darl and ‘Adiyy b. Badda’, when they were both [Still] Christians. 7 The man from the Banu 
Sahm died in a place where there were no Muslims. When the two came back with his bequeSt, they [his 
relatives] found that a silver bowl plated with gold was missing and so the two were brought before the 
Prophet ( 5 ); thereupon this verse was revealed. The Prophet (s) made the two swear oaths. The bowl was 
later discovered in Mecca, where the owners said that they had bought it from Tamim and ‘Udayy. The 
next verse was then revealed, after which two of the Sahmi man’s close kin came to swear their oaths; in 
al-Tirmidhl’s version, ‘Amr b. al-‘As, who was closer to the deceased man, ftood up with one other from 
among the kin, and they swore an oath; in yet another version, the [Sahmi] man fell ill and in&ruCted 
them as to his bequest and asked them to deliver what he had left to his family, but when he died, they 
took the bowl [and sold it] and then gave what remained [of that money] to his family. That, ruling mentioned, where the oath devolves to the inheritors, [makes it] likelier, brings 
closer [the eventuality], that they, the witnesses or the trustees, will bear the testimony in its true form, 
[the form] in which they have been charged to bear it, without distortion or breach of faith, or, it is 
likelier, that they will be afraid that after their oaths other oaths may be taken, from the inheritors, the 

7 Abu Ruqayya Tamim b. Aws b. Kharija al-Lakhmi (d. 40/660), a Christian from Palestine, and one among the delegation of ten 
men from the Banu al-Dar who converted to Islam in the year 9/630; he later became a Companion. He is mostly remembered for 
transmitting the apocalyptic hadtth about the mysterious creature ( al-jassasa ) which will gather information for the false messiah 
( aUdajjal ) nearer the Hour. Tamim and his brother, Nu'aym, were granted possession of the towns of Hebron and ‘Aynun, their 
hometowns, by the Prophet himself. Tamim left Medina for the Syrian lands after the assassination of ‘Uthman. The biographies 
of him SJteak at length of his devotions and night-vigils; see Dhahabi, Siyar, 11, 442-48; Ibn Hajar, Tahdhlb, 1, 322ft; Ibn al-Athir, 
Usd, 1, 428ft The incident related above by the authors of the Jalalayn is well-atteSted in the histories and biographical dictionaries. 
However, while there is no question that Tamim converted to Islam, it is not clear whether ‘Adiyy ever did. The prosopographical 
entry on him in Ibn al-Athir (Usd, iv, 5ft) Strongly suggests that at the time they were brought before the Prophet ‘Adiyy was Still 
a Christian.

If they are found guilty [of false testimony], let two others take their place, nearest in kin from among those who claim a lawful right, and let them swear by Allah, “Our testimony is more truthful than their testimony, and we have not transgressed, for then we would surely be among the wrongdoers.” . That is more likely that they will give true testimony, or else they will fear that their oaths could be refuted by the oaths of the others afterwards.

You, such as [having] a partner and so on. It is not mine, it is unjustified [for me], to say what I have no 
right to ( bi-haqq, ‘right to’, is the predicate of laysa, ‘not’; li, ‘mine’, is explicative). If I indeed had said it, 
You would have known it. You know what is, hidden by me, in my self, but I do not know what is within 
Your Self, that is, what You keep hidden of Your knowledge: You are the Knower of things unseen. I only said to them that which You commanded me, to [say], and that is: “Worship God, my 
Lord and your Lord.” And I was a witness, a watcher, over them, preventing them from [saying] what 
they used to say, whilst I was amongst them; but when You took me [to You], [when] You raised me up 
to the heaven, You were Yourself the Watcher over them, the Observer of their deeds, and You Yourself 
are Witness over all things. Aware and knowing them, including what I said to them and what they said 
after me, and whatever else. If you chastise them, that is, those among them who are fixed upon disbelief, verily they are Your 
servants, and You are their MaSter, disposing of them as You will: there can be no objection to [what] You 
[do]; and if You forgive them, that is, those of them who are believers, You, only You, are the Mighty, in 
His affair, the Wise’, in His adtions. God says, ‘This, namely, the Day of Resurrection, is the day those who were truthful, in the 
world, like Jesus, shall profit by their truthfidness, because this is the Day of Requital. Theirs will be Gar¬ 
dens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide forever. God is well-pleased with them, 
because of their obedience to Him, and they are well-pleased with Him, with His reward — that is the 
great triumph’. The sincerity of those who were liars in this world shall not avail them on that Day, juSt 
as [it shall not avail] the disbelievers when they believe upon seeing the chastisement. To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth, the Storehouses of rain, vegetation, 
sustenance and everything else, and all that is in them (wa-ma fihinna: the use of ma, ‘that’, indicates 
the predominance of all those non-rational creations); and He has power over all things, including the

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","When Allah will say, “O Jesus, son of Mary, did you tell people, ‘Take me and my mother as gods besides Allah?’ He will say, ‘Glory be to You! It is not for me to say what I have no right. Had I said so, You would have surely known it. You know what is within myself, whereas I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed, You are the All-Knower of all unseen.’” . I did not tell them except what You ordered me – ‘Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.’ I was witness over them as long as I was among them. But when You took me up, You Yourself were the Watcher over them, and You are a Witness over all things. .

6,1,3,"Praise, which means to describe in beautiful terms, be, [ever] established, to God-, is this meant to 
be informative, so that one believes in it? Or, is it meant as a eulogy, or both? These are three possibilities, 
the moSt likely of which is the laSt, as the Shaykh [Jalal al-Dln al-Mahalll] States in [his commentary on] 
surat al-Kahf[ Q. 18:1]; Who created the heavens and the earth — He singles out these two for mention 
because for the observer they constitute the moSt awesome [visible] creation; and He appointed. He 
created, darknesses and light, that is, every darkness ( zulma ) and every light: the use of the plural only 
in the case of the former is because it [darkness] has many causes; and this is one of the proofs of His 
Oneness; then those who disbelieve, deSJnte the existence of this proof, ascribe equals to their Lord, they 
worship others equally. It is He Who created you from clay, by creating your father Adam from it; then He decreed a term, 
for [each of] you, at the conclusion of which you die. A term is Stated, fixed, with Him, for your resur¬ 
rection; yet thereafter you, O disbelievers, doubt, you are uncertain about the Resurrection, when you 
know that it was He Who initiated your creation, and One Who has the power to initiate [creation], is 
even more capable of bringing you back [to life after death]. He is God, the One worthy of being worshipped, in the heavens and in the earth. He knows your 
secrets and your utterance, what you keep secret and what you utter openly among yourselves, and He 
knows what you earn, what you do of good and evil.","All praise is for Allah Who created the heavens and earth, and made darkness and light; yet those who disbelieve set up equals to their Lord. . It is He Who created you from clay, then decreed a term [for your life], and another term [for resurrection] known only to Him – yet you still doubt. . He is Allah in the heavens and on earth[1].

and We raised up after them another generation. And had We revealed to you a Scripture, inscribed, on parchment, as they requested, and had they

He is the Vanquisher over His slaves, and He is the All-Wise, the All-Aware.",
6,19,21,"When they said to the Prophet (s), ‘Bring us someone to testify to the truth of your prophethood, 
for the People of the Scripture have denied you’, the following was revealed: Say, to them: ‘What thing 
is greatest in testimony?’ ( shahadatan: this is for specification, and is derived from the [implied] subject 
of the sentence). Say: ‘God — even if they do not say this, there is no other response — He, is Witness 
between me and you, to my truthfulness; and this Qur’an has been revealed to me that I may warn you, 
[that I may] make you fear, O people of Mecca, thereby, and whomever it may reach (wa-man balagha : 
this is a supplement to the [suffixed] pronoun [‘you’] of undhira-kum, T may warn you’), that is to say, 
whomever among men and jinn the Qur’an may reach. Do you indeed bear witness that there are other 
gods with God?’ (this interrogative is meant as a disavowal). Say, to them: ‘I do not bear witness’, to this. 
Say: ‘He is only One God, and I am innocent of what you associate’, with Him of idols. Those to whom We have given the Scripture recognise him, that is, Muhammad (s), by the de¬ 
scriptions of him in their Scripture, as they recognise their sons; those, of them, who have forfeited their

own souls do not believe, in him. And who, that is, none, does greater evil than he who invents a lie against God, by ascribing to 
Him an associate, or denies His signs?, the Qur’an; it is verily the case that, they the evildoers shall not 
prosper, on account of this.","Say, “Whose testimony is the greatest?” Say, “Allah is Witness between me and you. This Qur’an has been revealed to me so that I may warn you thereby and whomsoever it reaches[4]. Do you really bear witness that there are other gods besides Allah?” Say, “I do not bear such witness.” Say, “Indeed, He is One God, and I disown all that you associate [with Him].” . Those to whom We gave the Scripture recognize [Muhammad][5] just as they recognize their own sons. Those who have ruined their own souls will not believe. . Who does greater wrong than one who fabricates lies against Allah or rejects His verses? The wrongdoers will never succeed.",[4] At every time and place until the Day of Judgment. . [5] They had an exact description of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) in their Scriptures.
6,22,26,"And, mention, on the day We shall gather them all together, then We shall say, in rebuke, to those 
who associated other gods with God, ‘Where are those associates of yours whom you were claiming?’, 

to be associates of God? Then their dissension (read accusative fitnatahum or nominative fitnatuhum) their apology, was 
(read lam takun or lam yakun ) only to say, in other words, [was only] their saying, ‘By God, our Lord 
(read rabbina as an adjective of [wa’Llahi, ‘by God’], or rabbana as a vocative) we were never idolaters’. God, exalted be He, says: See, O Muhammad (s), how they lie againSt themselves, by denying that 
their idolatry, and how that which they were forging, against God, in the way of associates, has failed, 
is absent [before], them! And there are some of them who listen to you, when you recite, and We have placed veils, covers, 
upon their hearts so that they do not understand it, [so that] they [do not] comprehend the Qur’an; and 
in their ears a heaviness, a deafness, so that they do not hear it with a willingness to accept it. And if they 
were to see every sign, they would not believe in it, so that when they come to you to argue with you, the 
disbelievers say, ‘This, Qur’an, is nothing but the fables, the lies, of the ancients’, similar to [their] jokes 
and strange tales ( asdtir, ‘fables’, is the plural of ustura). And, to people, they forbid it, the following of the Prophet (s), and keep away from it, and so they 
do not believe in him: it is said that this was revealed regarding Abu Talib, who used to forbid [people 
from] hurting him, but did not [himself] believe in him; and it is only themselves they destroy, when 
they keep away from him, because the harm thereof will befall them, but they do not perceive, this.","On the Day when We will gather them all together, then We will say to those who associated partners with Allah, “Where are your partners whom you claimed [to be equal to Allah]?” . Then they will have no excuse but to say, “By Allah, our Lord, we never associated any partners [with Allah][6].” . See how they will lie against themselves, and all what they used to fabricate will vanish from them. . There are some among them who listen to you[7], but We have placed covers on their hearts so that they do not understand it, and deafness in their ears. Even if they were to see every sign, they would still not believe in them. When they come to you arguing, the disbelievers say, “This is nothing but ancient fables.” . They prevent others from him, and they themselves keep away from him; they destroy none but themselves, but they do not realize.","[6] They will falsely swear, thinking they have something to stand on. . [7] When you recite the Qur’an."
6,27,32,"If you, O Muhammad (5), could see when they are made to Stand, [when] they are exposed, before 
the Fire, and they say, ‘Oh (yd is for exclamation) would that we might be returned, to the world; then 
we would not deny the signs of our Lord, but we would be among the believers!’ (read nukadhdhibu and 
nakunu as a new [independent] sentence; or read nukadhdhiba and nakuna as the [subjunctive] re^onse 
to the optative [clause]; or read nukadhdhibu and nakuna). The re^onse to the clause ‘if [you could see]’ 
would be ‘you would be seeing a terrible thing indeed’. God, exalted be He, says: Nay — [here used] in order to reject the desire to believe implied by 
the optative [exclamation] — that which they used to conceal, to hide, before, by their saying, By God, 
our Lord, we were never idolaters! [Q. 6:23]) has now become evident to them, as their limbs have borne 
witness [against them], and so they [now] wish for that [mentioned in the previous verse]; and even if, 
hypothetically, they were returned, to the world, they would return to that which they are forbidden, of 
idolatry; they are truly liars, when they promise that they would believe [if they were to be returned]. And they, those who deny the Resurrection, say, ‘There is no other, life, than our present life; we 
shall not be resurrected’. If you could see when they are made to Stand, [when they are] presented, before their Lord, you 
would certainly see an awesome thing! He will say, to them, by the tongue of the angels, in rebuke: ‘Is 
this, resurrection and reckoning, not the truth?’ They will say, ‘Yes indeed, by our Lord’, it is the truth! 
He will say, ‘Then taSte the chastisement because you disbelieved’, during life on earth. They indeed are losers who deny the encounter with God, through resurrection, until ( hatta is 
purposive to expose the [extent of their] mendacity) when the Hour, the Resurrection, comes upon them 
suddenly, they shall say, ‘Alas for us (ya hasratana, ‘O grief of ours’, expresses extreme suffering, the 
[vocative] call to which is figurative, meaning ‘Now is the time for you [O grief], so come forth!’) that we 
neglected it!’, the worldly life. On their backs they shall be bearing their burdens, so that these come to

them at the Resurrection in the vilest of forms and with the moSt putrid of smells, and they ride them. 
Ah, evil is that, burden of theirs, which they bear! The life of this world, that is, preoccupation with it, is nothing but a game and a diversion, while 
obedience and what is conducive to it are of the things of the Hereafter; surely the abode of the Hereafter 
(wa-la’l-daru is also read wa-la-daru’l-akhirati ), namely, Paradise, is better for those who fear idolatry. 
What, do they not understand? this, and so believe? (read a-fa-la ya’qiluna, ‘do they not understand’, or 
a-fa-la ta’qiluna, ‘do you not understand?’).","If you could only see when they will be made to stand before the Fire, they will say, “If only we were sent back, we would not reject the verses of our Lord, and we would be among the believers.” . But that which they used to conceal before will become apparent to them. And even if they were sent back, they would surely return to what they were forbidden, for they are indeed liars. . They say, “There is nothing beyond our life in this world, and we will not be resurrected.” . If you could only see when they are made to stand before their Lord. He will say, “Is this not the truth?” They will say, “Yes indeed, by our Lord.” He will say, “So taste the punishment for your disbelief.” . Losers indeed are those who deny the meeting with Allah, until when the Hour comes upon them by surprise, they will say, “Woe to us for having ignored this!” They will bear their burdens on their backs. Terrible indeed is their burden! . The life of this world is nothing but play and amusement, but the Home of the Hereafter is far better for those who fear Allah. Do you not then understand?",
6,33,35,"We know indeed (qad is a confirmative particle) that it grieves you that, matter, which they say, 
to you, in denial; yet it is not that they deny you, in secret, for they know that you are truthful (a variant 
reading [for la yukadhdhibunaka, ‘not [that] they deny you’] has la yukdhibunak, that is to say, ‘they do 
not associate you with mendacity’) but evildoers (al-zdlimin replaces the previous pronominalisation 
[‘they’]) knowingly reject, deny, the signs of God, the Qur’an. Messengers indeed have been denied before you — herein is a consolation for the Prophet (s) 
— yet they endured patiently the denial and the persecution until Our victorious help came to them, 
through the destruction of their peoples, so be patient until the victorious help comes to you through 
the destruction of your people. There is none to change the words of God, His promises, and there has 
already come to you tidings of the messengers, [tidings] through which your heart can be at peace. And if their aversion, to Islam, is grievous, [too] great, for you, on account of your concern for 
them, then, if you can, seek out a hole, an underground passage, in the earth, or a ladder, a Stairway, 
to heaven, that you may bring them a sign, from among those they have requested, then go ahead: the 
meaning is that you will not be able to do this, so be patient until God delivers His judgement — but had 
God willed, to guide them, He would have gathered them together in guidance, but He did not will this, 
and so they do not believe; so do not be among the ignorant, of this matter.","We know well that what they say grieves you [O Prophet]. It is not you that they doubt, rather it is the verses of Allah that the wrongdoers deny. . There were messengers rejected before you, but they endured patiently their rejection and persecution until Our help came to them. None can change the words of Allah. You have already received some accounts of those messengers[8]. . If you find their denial hard to bear, then seek – if you can – a tunnel into the earth or a stairway into the sky to bring them a sign. If Allah had willed, He could have brought them all to guidance; so do not be of those who are ignorant.",[8] “We relate to you [O Prophet] the stories of the messengers to strengthen your heart.” See 11:120.
6,36,41,"Only those who hear, in such a way so as to understand and take heed, will answer, your call to 
faith; as for the dead, that is, the disbelievers — they are likened to them on account of their inability to 
hear — God will resurrect them, in the Hereafter, and then to Him they will be returned, and He will 
requite them for their deeds. And they, the disbelievers of Mecca, say, ‘Why has a sign not been sent down to him from his 
Lord?’, [a sign] such as the she-camel [of the prophet Salih] or the Staff [of Moses] or the Table [of Jesus]. 
Say, to them: ‘Surely God has the power to send down (read yunazzil or yunzil ) a sign, from among 
those they have requested, but mod of them do not know’, that its sending down would be a trial for 
them, for if they then [Still] denied it, they would necessarily be destroyed. There is no (ma min: min is extra) animal, that crawls, on the earth and no bird that flies, through 
the air, with its wings, but they are communities like to you, in the way that its creation has been or¬ 
dained, together with its sustenance and affairs. We have neglected nothing (min shay’: min is extra) in 
the Book, in the Preserved Tablet ( al-lawh al-mahfuz), [nothing] that We have not written; then to their 
Lord they shall be gathered, and judgement shall be passed upon them, and the hornless sheep shall 
retaliate againSt the horned ram, and then it will be said to them [the animals], ‘Be duSt’. And those who deny Our signs, the Qur’an, are deaf, to hearing them in such a way so as to ac¬ 
cept [them], and dumb, [unable] to utter truth, in darkness, in unbelief. He whom God wills, to send 
aStray, He sends aStray, and whom He wills, to guide, He sets him on a Straight path, [a Straight] road, 
the religion of Islam. Say, O Muhammad (s), to the Meccans: ‘Do you see yourselves, [that is] inform me, if God’s chas¬ 
tisement comes upon you, in this world, or the Hour, the Resurrection, which includes this [chastise¬ 
ment], comes upon you, suddenly, will ye call upon any other than God? No! If you Speak truly!’, that 
the idols can benefit you, then call upon them. 


118 


Sura al-Ariam Nay; upon Him, and upon none other, you will call, in [times of] tribulation, and He will remove 
that which you call upon Him, to remove from you, such things as suffering, if He wills, to remove it, 
and you will forget, you will negledt, what you associate with Him, of idols and will not call them.","Only those who listen will respond. As for the dead[9], Allah will resurrect them, then to Him they will be returned. . They say, “Why has no sign been sent down to him from his Lord?” Say, “Allah is Capable to send down a sign,” but most of them do not know [the consequences]. . There is no moving creature on earth or a bird flying with its two wings, but are communities like you. We have missed nothing in the Record[10], then to their Lord they will be gathered. . Those who reject Our verses are deaf and dumb in the depths of darkness. Whomever Allah wills, He causes him to stray and whomever He wills, He leads him to a straight path. . Say, “What do you think[11], if there comes upon you the punishment of Allah or the Hour comes upon you, would you then call upon anyone other than Allah, if you are truthful?” . No, it is Him alone you would call upon[12]. If He willed, He could remove whatever harm made you call upon Him, and you would forget whatever partners you associate with Him.”","[9] i.e., the dead of heart, meaning the disbelievers. . [10] i.e., the Preserved Tablet. . [11] i.e., “Tell me..."" . [12] When you are touched by hardship."
6,42,45,"Indeed We sent to communities before you (min qablika: min is extra), messengers, but they de¬ 
nied them, and We seized them with misery, abjedt poverty, and hardship, illness, so that they might be 
humble, abased, that they might believe. If only, when Our might. Our punishment, came upon them, they had been humble, in other 
words, they were not so, even though the necessitating facftor was there. But their hearts were hard, and 
would not yield to faith, and Satan adorned for them what they were doing, in the way of disobedient 
adts, and so they persisted in them. So, when they forgot, [when] they neglecfted, that whereof they were reminded, that with which 
they were admonished and threatened, in the way of misery and hardship; and they did not heed the 
admonition. We opened (read fatahna or fattahna) to them the gates of all things, in the way of graces, 
in order to draw them on by degrees, until, when they rejoiced in what they were given, a wanton rejoic¬ 
ing, We seized them suddenly, with chastisement, and loi they were confounded, despairing of anything 
good. So the lad remnant of the people who did evil was cut off, by having them annihilated. Praise be 
to God, Lord of the Worlds, for giving vidtory to the messengers and destroying the disbelievers.","We sent messengers to nations before you and seized them with poverty and hardship, so that they may humble themselves. . If only they had humbled themselves when Our affliction came upon them, but their hearts were hardened, and Satan made their misdeeds appealing to them. . When they forgot the reminder that they were given[13], We opened for them the doors of everything – until when they rejoiced in pride for what they were given, We seized them by surprise, so they fell into utter despair. . Then the wrongdoers were totally exterminated. And all praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.","[13] i.e., their trial by hardship or the warning of their prophets."
6,46,50,"Say, to the people of Mecca: ‘Have you considered, inform me, if God were to seize your hearing, 
[if] He were to make you deaf, and your sight, [if] He were to make you blind, and set. Stamp, a seal 
upon your hearts, so that you no longer knew anything, who is the god other than God to give it back to 
you?’, that which He took away from you, as you [are wont to] claim? See how We dispense, [how] We 
make clear, the signs, the proofs of Our Oneness! Yet thereafter they are turning away, they rejedt them 
and do not believe. Say, to them: ‘Have you considered for yourselves, if God’s chastisement were to come uponyou, 
suddenly or openly?, at night or during the day; Would any be destroyed, except the evildoing, the un¬ 
believing,/oMc?’ That is to say, none but these will be destroyed. We do not send messengers, except as bearers of good tidings, to those who believe, [good tidings] 
of Paradise, and as warners, to those who disbelieve, [warning] of the Fire. Whoever believes, in them, 
and makes amends, in his deeds, no fear shall befall them, neither shall they grieve, in the Hereafter. But those who deny Our signs, the chastisement shall afflid them because they were wicked, 
rebelling againSt obedience. Say, to them: ‘I do not say to you, “I possess the treasure houses of God”, from which He provides 
sustenance; and I do not have knowledge of the Unseen, that which is hidden from me and has not been 
revealed to me. And I do not say to you, “I am an angel”, from among the angels; I only follow what is 
revealed to me.’ Say: ‘Is the blind man, the disbeliever, equal to the seeing man, the believer? No! Will 
you not then refled’ upon this and believe?","Say, “What do you think, if Allah were to take away your hearing and your sight, and seal up your hearts – which god other than Allah could restore them to you?” See how We diversify the signs, yet they still turn away. . Say, “What do you think, if the punishment of Allah were to come upon you, suddenly or predictably, who would be destroyed except the wrongdoing people?” . We do not send the messengers except as bringers of glad tidings and as warners. Those who believe and mend their ways, they will have no fear, nor will they grieve. . But those who reject Our verses will be afflicted with the punishment for their evil deeds. . Say [O Prophet], “I do not tell you that I have the treasuries of Allah, nor do I know the unseen, nor do I tell you that I am an angel. I only follow what is revealed to me.” Say, “Is the blind equal to the one who can see[14]? Do you not then contemplate?”","[14] The analogy of the blind and the seeing, the dead and the living, is indicating to the disbeliever who is blind of seeing the truth, and the believer who sees it and believes in it."
6,51,52,"And warn, threaten, therewith, that is, [with] the Qur’an, those who fear they shall be gathered to 
their Lord: apart from Him, other than Him, they have no protedor, to help them, and no intercessor, 
to intercede for them (the negative sentence Stands as a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subjedt of 
[the verb] yuhsharu, ‘they shall be gathered’, and constitutes the objedt of [what they] fear) — the sinning 
believers are meant here; so that they might be wary, of God, by desisting from what they engage in and 
performing deeds of obedience. And do not drive away those who call upon their Lord at morning and evening desiring, through 
their worship, His countenance, exalted be He, and not [desiring] any of the transient things of this 
world — and these are the poor. The idolaters had reviled them and demanded that he [the Prophet]

they become Muslims. You are not accountable for them in anything (min shay’in: min is extra), if what 
they hide in themselves be diseasing; nor are they accountable for you in anything, that you should 
drive them away (this is the response to the negative sentence) and be of the evildoers, if you do this.","Warn with this [Qur’an] those who fear that they will be gathered before their Lord – having no protector or intercessor other than Him – so that they may become righteous. . Do not send away [O Prophet] those who invoke their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure. You are not accountable for them whatsoever, nor are they accountable for you whatsoever. If you still send them away, you will be one of the wrongdoers.",
6,53,58,"And even so We have tried. We have tested, some of them by others, that is, the noble one by the 
commoner, the rich man by the poor man, preferring the [latter] one by giving [him] precedence in [at¬ 
taining] faith, so that they, the noble ones and the rich, may say, in disavowal, ‘Are these, the poor, the 
ones whom God has favoured from among us?’, with guidance? In other words [so that they may say]: 
if what they follow is [true] guidance, they would not have preceded us [in attaining it]. God, exalted be 
He, says: Is God not be ft aware of those who are thankful?, to Him, to guide them? Indeed [He is]. And when those who believe in Our signs come to you, say, to them: ‘Peace be upon you. Your 
Lord has prescribed. He has decreed, for Himself mercy, to the effecft that, truly ( innahu, ‘truly) may also 
be read as annahu, ‘that’, as a substitution for al-rahma, ‘mercy’) whoever of you does evil in ignorance, 
of it when he did it, and repents thereafter, after his [evil] deed, [repents] of it, and makes amends, in 
his acftions — truly He, God, is Forgiving, Merciful’, towards him (a variant reading [for innahu, ‘truly 
He’] has annahu, ‘then He’), in other words, forgiveness shall be for him. And thus, in the same way that We have explained what has been mentioned, We diftinguish. 
We expound, the signs, the Qur’an, so that truth becomes manifest and is implemented in [people’s] 
deeds, and that the way, the path, of the sinners may be become clear, evident, and hence avoided (wa- 
li-yaftabina may also be read wa-li-taftabina, ‘that you may discern’, with sabila, ‘the way’, read in the 
accusative [as opposed to the nominative, sabilu], implying a direcft address to the Prophet [s]). Say: ‘Truly I have been forbidden to worship those whom you callupon, [those whom] you wor¬ 
ship, besides God.’ Say: ‘I shall not follow your whims, by worshipping them, for then, if I did follow 
them, verily I would have gone aftray and I would not be of the rightly guided’. Say: ‘I am upon a clear proof, a [clear] Statement, from my Lord, and you have, already, denied 
Him, my Lord, when you associated others with Him. I do not have that which you seek to haften, of the 
chastisement; the judgement, in this matter and in [all] others, is God’s alone. He decrees the, judgement 
of, truth, and He is the Be ft of Deciders’, [the BeSt of] Judges (a variant reading [for yaqdi, ‘He decrees’] 
has yaqussu, that is, ‘He relates [the truth]’). Say, to them: ‘If I did have what you seek to haften, the matter between you and me would have 
been decided, by my hastening it for you, so that I might find reSt; but God has it; and God knows be ft 
the evildoers’, and when to punish them.","Thus We have tested some of them by means of others, so that they may say, “Are these the ones whom Allah has favored among us[15]?” Does Allah not know best those who are grateful? . When those who believe in Our verses come to you, say, “Peace be upon you. Your Lord has decreed mercy upon Himself; whoever among you commits a sin out of ignorance then repents afterwards and mends his ways, then Allah is indeed All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” . This is how We explain the verses in detail, so that the way of the evildoers may become known. . Say, “I have been forbidden to worship those whom you supplicate besides Allah.” Say, “I do not follow your desires[16]. If I did, I would go astray and I would not be one of those who are guided.” . Say [O Prophet], “I am on clear evidence from my Lord, yet you have denied it. I do not have that [punishment] which you seek to hasten.

Say, “If that which you seek to hasten were within my power, the matter would have already been decided between me and you.

such as atones [cf. Q. 8:32] or a Cry [cf. Q. 11:67], or from beneath your feet, such as the causing of the 
earth to cave in [cf. Q. 29:40], or to confound you, to confuse you, in parties, secfts with differing whims, 
and to make you taSte the violence of one another’, through fighting. When this [verse] was revealed, the 
Prophet (s) said, ‘This [chastisement etc.] is easier and lighter’; but when the laSt Statement was revealed, 
he said, ‘I seek refuge with Your Countenance!’, as reported by al-Bukharl. Muslim reports the [follow¬ 
ing] hadith : ‘I requested from my Lord not to make my community violent towards each other, but He 
denied me this [request] ’. In another hadith, when it was revealed, he [is reported to have] said, ‘As for 
this, it will surely come to pass, even though its proper meaning has not yet come’. See how We dispense, 
[how] We clarify for them, the signs, the proofs of Our power, that perhaps they might understand, that 
they might realise that what they follow is falsehood. Your people have denied it, the Qur’an. Yet it is the truth. Say, to them: 7 am not a guardian over 
you, to requite you. I am only a warner and your affair is left to God — this was [revealed] before the 
command to fight [the idolaters]. Every tiding, [every] announcement, has a conclusion, a [fixed] time in which it will take place 
and be concluded, including [the tiding concerning] your punishment. And you will come to know’ — 
this is a threat for them.","Say, “Who rescues you from the darkness of the land and sea? You invoke Him humbly and privately[21], ‘If only He rescues us from this, we will certainly be among those who are grateful.’” . Say, “Allah rescues you from it and from every distress, yet you associate partners with Him.” . Say, “He is Capable of sending a punishment from above you or from beneath your feet, or split you into factions, and make you suffer at the hands of one another.” See how We diversify the signs, so that they may understand. . But your people [O Prophet] have rejected this [Qur’an] although it is the truth. Say, “I am not a keeper over you. . Every matter has an appointed time, and you will soon come to know.","[21] The Arabs of that time did not deny Allah’s Lordship (tawhīd al-rubūbiyyah) Whom they turned to in times of hardship, but they denied His sole Divinity (tawhīd al-ulūhiyyah), i.e., worshiping none but Allah."
6,68,70,"When you see those who engage in discourse about Our signs, the Qur’an, in mockery, turn away 
from them, and do not sit with them, until they discourse on some other topic. And if(immd: the letter 
nun of the conditional particle in has been assimilated with the extra rnd) Satan should make you forget 
(read yunsiyannaka or yunassiyannaka), and you sit with them, then do not sit, after the reminder, that 
is, [after] you remember, with the evildoing folk (the overt noun [al-qawm al-zalimin, ‘the evildoing 
folk’] replaces the [third person] pronominalisation). The Muslims then said, ‘If we get up [and leave] every time they delve [into the matter of the 
Qur’an], we would never be able to sit in the Mosque or perform circumambulations. Therefore, the fol¬ 
lowing was revealed: Those who fear God, are not accountable for them, [for] those who discourse [in 
mockery], in anything ( min shay’in: min is extra), if they should sit with them; but it is the reminder, 
that they are accountable for; [a reminder given] to make them remember and to admonish them, so 
that perhaps they will be wary, of discoursing thus. And forsake, leave alone, those who take their religion, with which they have been charged, as a 
game and a diversion, making a mockery of it, and whom the life of this world has deluded, and so do 
not interfere with them — this was [revealed] before the command to fight [them]. Remind, admonish

sor, to ward off the chastisement from it; and though it offer every compensation, [though] it pay every 
ransom, it shall not be accepted from it, that which it offers as ransom. Those are the ones who perish 
by what they have earned; for them shall be a draught of boiling water and a painful chastisement, 
because they disbelieved, that is, for their unbelief. 1","When you see those who ridicule Our verses, turn away from them until they engage in another discourse. If Satan should make you forget, then as soon as you remember, do not remain with the wrongdoing people. . Those who fear Allah are in no way accountable for them; their duty is only to remind, so that they may abstain [from mockery]. . Leave those who take their religion as play and amusement, and are deluded by the life of this world. But admonish them with this [Qur’an], so no soul should be ruined for its misdeeds – having no protector or intercessor other than Allah. Even if they were to offer every form of ransom, it would not be accepted. Such are the ones who will be ruined for their misdeeds. They will have scalding water to drink and a painful punishment for their disbelief.",

worship them, nor hurts us, if we negleCt [to worship] them — these are the idols; and so be turned 
back, [and so] return to idolatry, after God has guided us, to Islam? — Like one whom the devils have 
lured, led astray, in the earth, bewildered, confused, not knowing where to go ( hayrdn, ‘bewildered’, 
is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the [suffixed pronoun] ha [of iStahwat-hu, ‘whom they have 
lured’]); he has companions, a group, who call him to guidance, that is to say, [they are there] in order 
to guide him to the [right] path, saying to him: “Come to us!’”, but he does not respond to them, and he 
perishes (the interrogative Statement is meant as a disavowal; the comparative Statement [beginning with 
ka’lladhi, ‘like one whom] is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject [of the verb] nuraddu, ‘be 
turned back’). Say: ‘Tridy, God’s guidance, which is Islam, is [the true] guidance, everything else being 
error, and we have been commanded to submit to the Lord of the Worlds, and to, that is, [to submit] by, establishing prayer and fearing Him, exalted be He; He it is to 
Whom you shall be gathered’, you shall be brought together, on the Day of Resurrection for reckoning. He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in truth, that is to say, with the purpose of [mani¬ 
festing] truth. And, mention, the day He says, to a thing, ‘Be’, and it is — this is the Day of Resurrection, 
when He says to creatures, ‘Rise up’, and they do. His words are the truth, the truth that will doubtless 
come to pass; and His is the Kingdom the day when the trumpet, the horn, is blown, the second blaSt by 
[the angel] Israfil, when there shall be no kingdom for any other than Him: ‘ Whose is the Kingdom today? 
God’s’ [Q. 40:16]. He is the Knower of the Unseen and the visible, what is hidden and what may be seen. 
He is the Wise, in His creation, the Aware, of things inwardly hidden and outwardly manifest.","Say, “Shall we invoke[22] besides Allah that which can neither benefit nor harm us, and shall we turn back to disbelief after being guided by Allah? Just like the one whom devils have tempted in the land leaving him bewildered, although he has companions inviting him to guidance[23], “Come to us.” Say, “Allah’s guidance is the [true] guidance, and we are commanded to submit to the Lord of the worlds, . and to establish prayer and fear Him, for it is He to Whom you will all be gathered. . It is He Who created the heavens and earth for a true purpose. On the Day [of Resurrection] He will say, “Be,” and it will be. His word is the truth. His is the dominion on the Day the Trumpet will be blown. He is the Knower of the unseen and the seen, and He is the All-Wise, the All-Aware.”","[22] i.e., worship.
 [23] The example given is of one who lost his way and is further confused by evil ones, tempting him to follow various directions, all leading to destruction; although his sincere friends call him to the right direction, but he ignores them."
6,74,79,"And, mention, when Abraham said to his father Azar, which was his cognomen, his [firSt] name 
being Terah ( Tarikh ): ‘Do you take idols as gods, to worship? (an interrogative meant as a rebuke). I see 
you and your people, by [this acft of] taking them [as gods], in manifest error’, far from the truth. And so, juSt as We show him the misguidance of his father and his people. We show Abraham 
the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, that he might infer thereby [the truth of] Our Oneness, and 
that he might be of those knowing, it, with certainty (the sentence beginning with wa-kadhalika, ‘and 
so’, and what follows it, is a parenthetical Statement and a supplement to [the one beginning with] qala, 
‘he said’). When night descended, [when] it darkened, upon him he saw a ftar — said to have been Venus 

— and said, to his people, who were astrologers: ‘This is my Lord’, as you [are wont to] claim. But when 
it set, when it disappeared, he said, ‘I love not those that set’, to take them as lords, because it is not 
possible for a [true] Lord to be transformed or to change place, as such [attributes] pertain to accidents 

— but this had no effeCt on them. And when he saw the moon rising, appearing, he said, to them: ‘This is my Lord.’ But when it set 
he said, ‘Unless my Lord guides me, [unless] He establishes me within [true] guidance, I shall surely 
become one of the folk who are aftray’ — an intimation to his people that they are aStray, but Still this 
had no effeCt on them. And when he saw the sun rising, he said, ‘This is my Lord; this is greater!’ than the Star and the 
moon (the masculine [demonstrative pronoun] hadha, ‘this’, is used [for the feminine shams, ‘sun’] be¬ 
cause the predicate [rabbi, ‘my Lord’] is masculine). But when it set, and the argument againSt them had

become stronger and they still had not repented, he said, ‘O my people, surely I am innocent of what you 
associate, with God, in the way of idols and accidental bodies, which require an originator. They then 
asked him, ‘What do you worship?’ He said: Verily I have turned my face to, I am seeking in worship, Him Who originated, created, 
the heavens and the earth, namely, God; a hanif inclining towards the upright religion, and I am not of 
those that associate others’, with Him.","And [remember] when Abraham said to his father, Āzar, “Do you take idols as gods? I see that you and your people are clearly misguided.” . Thus We showed Abraham the dominion of the heavens and earth so that he would be of those who have certain faith. . When the night grew dark upon him, he saw a star and said, “This is my Lord.” But when it set, he said, “I do not like those that set.”[24] . Then when he saw the moon rising, he said, “This is my Lord.” But when it set, he said, “Unless my Lord guides me, I will surely be among the misguided people.” . Then when he saw the sun rising, he said, “This is my Lord; this is greater.” But when it set, he said, “O my people, I disown all what you associate with Allah. . I turn my face towards the One Who originated the heavens and earth, inclining to true faith, and I am not one of those who associate partners with Allah.”",[24] Abraham wanted to show them futility and folly of worshiping mere idols by a logical conclusion.
6,80,83,"But his people disputed with him, they argued with him about his religion and threatened him 
that the idols would strike him with evil if he abandoned them. He said, ‘Do you dispute with me (read 
a-tuhdjjunni, or a-tuhdjuni where one of the two letters nun is omitted, the nun which grammarians 
refer to as nun al-raf, ‘the nun of [modal] independence’, and which the Qur’anic reciters refer to as nun 
al-wiqaya, ‘the nun of preservation’); 2 do you argue with me, concerning, the Oneness of, God when He, 
exalted be He, has guided me, to it? I have no fear of what you associate with Him, in the way of idols, 
that they might strike me with some evil, since they have no power to do anything, unless my Lord wills 
something, harmful to befall me and it does. My Lord encompasses all things through His knowledge; 
will you not remember, this and believe? How should I fear what you have associated, with God, when it can neither profit nor harm, 
and you fear not, God [in], that you have associated with God, in worship, that for which He has not 
revealed to you any warrant?’, [any] argument or proof, when He has power over all things. Which of 
the two parties has more right to security, is it us or you, if you have any knowledge, of who has more 
right? In other words: it is us, so follow Him. God, exalted be He, says: Those who believe and have not confounded, mixed, their belief with evildoing, that is, idolatry 
— explained as such by a hadith in the two Sahihs [of Bukhari and Muslim] — theirs is security, from 
chastisement; and they are rightly guided. That ( tilka is the subjecft [of the sentence] and is substituted by [the following hujjatuna ]) argu¬ 
ment of Ours , 3 with which Abraham inferred God’s Oneness, as in the case of the setting Stars and what 
came afterwards; (the predicate is [what follows]) We bestowed upon Abraham, We guided him to it, as 
an argument, again ft his people. We raise up in degrees whom We will (read this as [a genitive] annexa¬ 
tion, darajati man nasha, or as [accusative] nunation, darajatin man nashd’), [degrees] in knowledge 
and wisdom; surely your Lord is Wise, in His actions, Knowing, of His creation.","His people argued with him. He said, “Do you argue with me concerning Allah when He has guided me? I do not fear what you associate with Him, [none can harm me] except what my Lord wills. My Lord encompasses everything in His knowledge. Will you not then take heed? . Why should I fear what you associate with Him, when you do not fear that you associate with Allah for which He has not sent down any authority? So which of the two parties has more right to feel secure, if you really know? . Those who believe and do not mix their faith with falsehood[25] are the ones who will be secure, and it is they who are rightly guided. . That was Our argument which We gave Abraham against his people. We elevate in ranks whom We will. Your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.","[25] i.e., they do not worship others besides Allah."
6,84,90,"And We be flowed upon him Isaac and, his son, Jacob; each one, of the two, We guided. And Noah 
We guided before, that is, before Abraham, and of his seed, that is, Noah’s [seed], David and, his son, 
Solomon, and Job and Joseph, son of Jacob, and Moses and Aaron; and so, in the same way that We have 
requited them. We requite the virtuous. And Zachariah and, his son, John, and Jesus, son of Mary — this shows that [the term] ‘seed’ 
(dhurriyya ) can include offering from the female [side] — and Elias, the paternal nephew of Aaron, 
brother of Moses; all, of them, were of the righteous. 

2 DeSJiite the differing terminology both characterisations are intended to identify this penultimate nun as that of the indicative 
mood of the verb (here the second person plural), since the firSt person pronoun becomes -ni when suffixed to a verb as its direct 
objeCt (whereas it does not with a preposition: li, ‘to me’). This nun al-raf has been translated as the nun of‘independence’ in order 
to identify it with the indicative mood, which is not governed by any particle or clause, and to distinguish it from other dependent 
moods of the verb, such as the subjunctive or the jussive. Similarly, the alternative characterisation of wiqaya refers to the ‘pres¬ 
ervation’ of the identity of the morphemes in a word such as tuhajjunni, where tuhdjjuna is the second person plural indicative 
and -111 is the suffixed firSt person pronoun; such distinctions are important, since the same word written in the subjunctive mood 
would be tuhajjuni. 

3 Translations of the Qur’an render this as ""That is Our argument’, so that ‘Our argument’ is the predicate of ‘that’ and what follows 
is a relative clause. However, the verse has been translated according the grammatical gloss given in this commentary, where ‘that’ 
and ‘Our argument’ are alternative subjects with the predicate coming afterwards.

Tafsir al-Jalalayn And Ishmael, son of Abraham, and Elisha (Ilyasa, the lam is extra), 4 and Jonah and Lot, son of 
Haran, brother of Abraham, all, of them, We preferred above all the worlds, through prophethood. And of their fathers, and of their seed, and of their brethren (this [clause] is a supplement either 
to [the previous] kullan, ‘all of them, or to Nuhan, ‘Noah’; min, ‘of’, is partitive, because some of them 
did not have offering, while others had disbelievers among their offering); and We chose them and We 
guided them to a Straight path. That, religion to which they were guided, is God’s guidance wherewith He guides whom He will of His 
servants; had they, hypothetically peaking, been idolaters, all that they did would have been in vain. They are the ones to whom We gave the Scripture, meaning the Books [of God], judgement, 
wisdom, and prophethood; so if these, people of Mecca, disbelieve therein, that is, in these three, then 
indeed We have entrusted it to. We have set aside for it, a people who do not disbelieve in it, namely, the 
Emigrants ( Muhajirun ) and the Helpers (Ansar). They are the ones whom God has guided; so follow their guidance, their way of affirming God’s 
Oneness and of [exercising] patience (read iqtadih, ‘follow’, with the silent ha, whether pausing or con¬ 
tinuing the recitation; a variant reading omits it in continuous recitation). Say, to the people of Mecca: 7 
do notask of you, to give me, any wage for it, the Qur’an; it, the Qur’an, is only a reminder, an admoni¬ 
tion, to all the worlds’, of mankind and jinn.","We granted him Isaac and Jacob – each of them We guided as We previously guided Noah, and among his descendants: David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron. Thus do We reward those who do good. . And Zachariah, John, Jesus, and Elias – each was among the righteous. . Also Ishmael, Elisha, Jonah, and Lot – each of them We preferred over all other people [of their times]. . And some of their fathers, their descendants, and their brothers – We chose them and guided them to a straight path. . This is Allah’s guidance with which He guides whom He wills of His slaves. If they were to associate others with Him, all their deeds would have been nullified. . They are those whom We gave the Scripture, wisdom and prophethood. But if these [pagans] disbelieve in it, then We have entrusted it to a people who will not disbelieve in it. . They are those whom Allah has guided, so follow their guidance. Say, “I do not ask you any reward for it. It is but a reminder for the worlds.”",
6,91,92,"They, that is, the Jews, measured not God with His true measure, that is, they have not extended 
Him the grandeur that truly befits Him, or [it means] they have not attained the true knowledge of 
Him, when they said, to the Prophet (s), diluting with him about the Qur’an: ‘God has not revealed 
anything to any mortal.’ Say, to them: ‘Who revealed the Book which Moses brought, a light and guid¬ 
ance for mankind? You put it (in all three instances [the verbs may be] read either in the third person 
plural [yafalunahu, ‘they put it’; yubdunaha, ‘they reveal it’; wa-yukhfuna, ‘and they hide’] or in the 
second person plural [tafalunahu, ‘you put it’; tubdunaha, ‘you reveal it’; wa-tukhfuna, ‘and you hide’]) 
on parchments, that is, you write it down on fragments of notes, which you disclose, that is, what you 
choose to disclose thereof, but you hide much, of what is in them, as in [the case of] the descriptions of 
Muhammad (s); and you have been taught, O Jews, in the Qur’an, what you did not know, neither you 
nor your fathers’, in the Torah, through the elucidation therein of what you were confused about and in 
disagreement over. Say: ‘God’, revealed it — and if they do not say it, there is no other response — then 
leave them to play in their discourse, their falsehood. And this, Qur’an, is a blessed Book We have revealed, confirming that which was before it, of 
scriptures, and that you may warn (li-tundhira, or read li-yundhira, ‘that it may warn, as supplement to 
the import of the preceding statement [sc. ‘to confirm that which was before it and to warn’]), in other 
words, We have revealed it for [the] blessings [it gives], as a vindication [of previous scripture] and for 
you to warn therewith, the Mother of Towns and those around it, that is, the inhabitants of Mecca and 
all other people; and those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and they observe their prayers, 
fearing the punishment thereof.","They did not revere Allah His true reverence when they said, “Allah has sent down nothing to human beings.” Say [O Prophet], “Who then sent down the Scripture that Moses brought as a light and guidance for people, but you make it into separate sheets – revealing some and concealing much, although you have been taught [this Qur’an] which neither you nor your forefathers knew?” Say, “Allah [sent it down].” Then leave them to amuse themselves in their falsehood. . This is a blessed Book which We have sent down – confirming what came before it, so that you will warn the Mother of Cities [i.e., Makkah] and all those around it[26]. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it and are mindful of their prayers.","[26] i.e., all other peoples."
6,93,94,"And who, that is, none, does greater evil than he who invents lies againft God, by claiming 
prophethood when he has not been called to it, or who says, ‘It is revealed to me’, when nothing has 
been revealed to him — this was revealed regarding [the false prophet] Musaylama [al-Kadhdhab] — or 
he who says, 7 will reveal the like of what God has revealed’? — these were the mockers who would 
say: If we wish we can Speak the like of this [Q. 8:31]; If you could only see, O Muhammad (s), when the, 
mentioned, evildoers are in the agonies, the throes, of death and the angels extend their hands, against 
them, beating and torturing them, saying to them in &ern censure: ‘Give up your souls!, to us that we

cessors, the idols, whom you claimed to be associates, of God, amongst you, that is, in deserving your 
worship; it has been severed between you, that is to say, your bond has been dissolved (a variant read¬ 
ing [for baynukum, ‘your union’] 5 has baynakum, ‘between you’, making it an adverbial qualifier, that is, 
the bond ‘between you’ [has been severed]’), and that, intercession of theirs, which you claimed, in the 
world, has failed, abandoned, you’.","Who does greater wrong than the one who fabricates lies against Allah or says, “A revelation has come to me” – whereas nothing has been revealed to him, or the one who says, “I can send down the like of what Allah has sent down.” If only you could see the wrongdoers in the throes of death while the angels are stretching out their hands[27] [saying], “Give up your souls! Today you will be recompensed with a disgracing punishment, because you used to tell lies against Allah and you arrogantly rejected His verses.” . “Now you have come to Us alone[28] just as We created you the first time – leaving behind all that We had bestowed upon you.

It is He Who originated you from a single soul, then assigned for you a place to stay and a place to rest[32]. We have made the signs clear for people who understand. . It is He Who sends down water from the sky and We produce thereby vegetation of all kinds. We produce from it greenery from which We bring forth clustered grains. From the spathes of palm trees emerge clusters of dates hanging within reach and gardens of grapevines, olives, and pomegranates – similar [in shape] yet different [in taste]. Look at their fruit when they bear fruit and ripen. Indeed, there are signs in these for people who believe.","[31] i.e., their precise movement. .

6,100,105,"Yet they ascribe to God ( li’Llahi, the indirect objed) as associates ( shurakaa, the direcft objed, 
which is substituted by [the following, al-jinn ]) the jinn, since they obey them by worshipping graven 
images, even though He created them-, so how can they be associates? And they falsely impute to Him 
(read kharaqu or kharraqu), that is, they invent, sons and daughters without any knowledge, saying, 
Ezra (‘ Uzayr ) is the son of God, and the angels are the daughters of God. Glory be to Him — an affirma¬ 
tion of His transcendence — and exalted be He above what they describe!, of Him having a child. He is, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, which He originated uniquely without prec¬ 
edent; how should He have a son, when He has no consort, SJiouse, and He created everything, that was 
meant to be created, and He has knowledge of all things? That then is God, your Lord. There is no god but Him, the Creator of all things. So worship Him, 
affirm His Oneness. And He is Guardian over, [He is] Keeper of, all things. Vision cannot attain Him, that is, they [the eyes] cannot see Him — this is [a denial that applies] 
in particular [circumstances], since [it is accepted] that the believer will see Him in the Hereafter, as in¬ 
dicated by Gods words, On that Day faces shall be radiant, gazing upon their Lord [Q. 75:22b], and by the 
hadith of the two Shaykhs [Bukhari and Muslim]: ‘Verily you shall see your Lord, as clearly as you see the 
full moon at night’) — and it is also said [to mean] that it [vision] cannot encompass Him; but He attains 
[all] vision, that is to say, He perceives them, whereas they cannot perceive Him; it is not possible in [the 
case of] anyone other than Him to attain all vision while it [vision] cannot attain Him or encompass Him 
in knowledge. And He is the Subtle, [in dealing] with His friends, the Aware, of them. Say, O Muhammad (s), to them: Clear proofs have come to you from your Lord; whoever per¬ 
ceives, them and believes, then it is for his own good, that he has perceived [them], since the reward 
resulting from his perception will be his; and whoever is blind, to them and goes astray, then it, the evil 
consequence of his being asftray, will be to his own hurt. And I am not a keeper, a watcher, over you, of 
your deeds: I am but a warner. And so, in the same way that We have explained what has been mentioned, We dispense. We 
elucidate, the signs, that they might take heed, and that they, the disbelievers, may say, at the end of 
this: ‘You have Studied with someone’, that you have consulted with ( daraSla ) the People of the Scrip¬ 
ture or [that] you have studied ( daraSla, variant reading) the scriptures of pad peoples and brought this 
[Qur’an] therefrom; and that We may make it clear for a people who have knowledge.","They regard the jinn as partners of Allah, even though He created them, and they falsely attribute to Him sons and daughters without knowledge. Glorified and Exalted is He far above what they ascribe to Him. . He is the Originator of the heavens and earth. How could He have a son when He never had a companion? He created all things, and He is All-Knowing of everything. . Such is Allah, your Lord; none has the right to be worshiped except Him, the Creator of all things. So worship Him, for He is the Maintainer of all things. . No vision can encompass Him[33], but He encompasses all vision, and He is the Most Subtle, the All-Aware. . There have come to you insights from your Lord. Whoever chooses to see [the truth], it is for his own good. But whoever turns a blind eye, it is to his own loss. And [say], “I am not a keeper over you.” .

6,114,117,"The following was revealed when they asked the Prophet (s) to appoint an arbiter between him 
and themselves. Say: Shall I seek, demand, other than God as a judge, an arbiter between you and me,

guished from falsehood. Those to whom We have given the Scripture, the Torah, the likes of ‘Abd Allah 
b. Salam and his companions, know that it is revealed (read munzal or munazzal) from your Lord in 
truth; so do not be of the waverers, the doubters, regarding it: this is intended to affirm to the disbeliev¬

and juftice ( sidqan wa-’adlan is for Specification); none can change His words, either by contravening 
[His rulings] or evading [His appointed terms]. He is the Hearing, of what is said, the Knowing, of what 
is done. If you obey moft of those on earth, that is, the disbelievers, they will lead you aflray front the 
way of God, [from] His religion; they follow only supposition, when they dispute with you concerning 
[the Status of] carrion, saying: ‘What God has killed is more worthy of your consumption than what you 
kill yourselves!’; they are merely guessing. Speaking falsehood in this [matter]. Your Lord knows heft those who fir ay from His way and He knows well the rightly guided, and 
will requite both of them.","[Say], “Should I seek a judge other than Allah when He is the One Who has sent down to you the Book explained in detail?” Those whom We gave the Book know that it has been sent down from your Lord in truth, so never be among those who doubt. .

‘ [what] He has forbidden’]) for you what He has forbidden, in the verse: Forbidden to you is carrion ... 
[Q. 5:3], except that to which you are compelled?, thereof, which is also lawful for you. The meaning 
is: there is nothing to prevent you from eating what has been mentioned, for He has explained to you 
what is forbidden for consumption, and that [over which God’s Name has been invoked] is not among 
these [forbidden things]. But truly many are led aStray (read la-yadilluna, ‘[many] are led astray’, or la- 
yudilluna, ‘[many] lead [others] astray’), by their whims, by what their own selves fancy, in the way of 
permitting [the consumption of] carrion and otherwise, without any knowledge, with which to support 
their claims. Truly your Lord knows the transgressors, those who overstep [the bounds] of what is lawful 
into what is unlawful. And forsake, leave, outward aSpeCl of sin and its inward aSpedt, that is, what is overt of it and 
what is secret — it is said that ‘sin here means fornication, or, it is said, any adt of disobedience; surely 
those who earn sin shall be requited, in the Hereafter, for what they used to perpetrate, [what] they used 
to earn. And do not eat from that over which God’s Name has not been invoked, where it has died or 
been sacrificed to other than His Name — otherwise, what a Muslim sacrifices and does not invoke 
God’s Name over, whether intentionally or forgetfully, is lawful, as was stated by Ibn ‘Abbas, and this is 
the opinion of al-Shafi'i — verily it, the eating thereof, is wickedness, a contravention of what is lawful. 
And truly the devils inspire, whiter [to], their friends, the disbelievers, to dispute with you, in deeming 
carrion lawful; and if you obey them, in this [matter], you are truly idolaters.","So eat of that [meat] over which the name of Allah is mentioned[37] if you [truly] believe in his verses. . Why should you not eat of that over which the name of Allah is mentioned when He has expounded clearly what is forbidden to you, unless you are compelled by necessity[38]? Indeed, many [deviants] lead others astray by their desires, without any knowledge. Your Lord knows best the transgressors. . Avoid committing sin, whether openly or in secret. Indeed, those who commit sin will be recompensed for what they used to do. . Do not eat of that [meat] over which the name of Allah is not mentioned, for this is a grave disobedience.

6,122,124,"The following was revealed regarding Abu Jahl and others: Why, is he who was dead, through 
unbelief, and We gave him life, through guidance, and appointed for him a light by which to walk 
among people, distinguishing thereby the truth from falsehood — this [light] being faith — as him 
whose likeness (ka-man mathaluhu-. mathal, ‘likeness’, is extra; in other words, [read] ka-man huwa, ‘as 
him who’) is in darkness whence he cannot emerge? — and this is the disbeliever — No! So, in the same 
way that faith has been adorned for believers, what the disbelievers have been doing, in the way of dis¬ 
belief and adts of disobedience, has been adorned for them. And thus, in the same way that We have made the wicked folk of Mecca its leaders, We have 
made in every city its sinners great ones, that they may plot therein, to impede the faith; but they plot 
only againSt themselves, because the evil consequences thereof will befall them, though they do not 
perceive, this. And when a sign, of the truth of the Prophet (s), comes to them, the people of Mecca, they say, 
‘We will not believe, in him, until we are given the like of what God’s messengers were given’, in the way 
of a message and inspiration to us, because we are wealthier and more senior in years. God, exalted be 
He, says: God knows beSl where to place His Message (read plural [risalatihi, ‘His Messages’] or singular 
[risalatahu, ‘His Message’]; hayth, ‘where’, constitutes the diredt objecft because of the verb [ya’lam, ‘He 
knows’] implicit in alam, ‘the beSt knower’) that is to say, He knows the right place for it to be placed in, 
and He thus places it [there] — these people, however, are not worthy of it. Humiliation from God and 
a terrible chastisement shall smite those who have sinned, by saying this, for their plotting.","Is the one who was dead and We gave him life [by faith] and gave him a light with which he walks among people like the one in darkness from which he can never escape[40]? This is how the deeds of the disbelievers have been made appealing to them. . Thus We have placed in every city the most wicked ones to conspire in it, yet they only conspire against themselves, without even realizing it. . When a sign comes to them, they say, “We will never believe until we are given the like of what was given to the messengers of Allah.” Allah knows best where to place His message. Those who are wicked will be afflicted with disgrace from Allah and a severe punishment for their plots.",[40] The simile given here is about someone who is guided by light of guidance and someone who is bereft of the light of guidance.
6,125,127,"Whomever God desires to guide, He expands his breaSt to Islam, by casting into his heart a light 
which it [the heart] expands for and accepts, as reported in a hadith; and whomever He, God, desires 
to send aStray, He makes his breaSt narrow (read dayqan or dayyiqan), [unable] to accept it, and con¬ 
stricted, extremely tight (read harijan, ‘conStridted’, as an adjedtive, or harajan as a verbal noun, by which

enjoyed what the jinn adorned for them of passions, while the jinn [enjoyed] mankind’s obedience to 
them; but now we have arrived at the term which You have appointed for us’, that is, the Day of Resur¬

wills, of those times when they will exit from it in order to drink boiling water, which is located outside

‘We bear witness againd ourselves’, that [all] this was conveyed to us. God, exalted be He, says: And the 
life of this world deluded them, and so they did not believe. And they bear witness againd themselves 
that they were disbelievers. That, sending of the messengers, is because (an, [phonetically] lightened, with the lam [of li-

injustice, on their part, while their inhabitants were heedless, not having had any Messenger to make

This is how We make the wrongdoers take control over one another[43] because of what they used to do. . “O assembly of jinn and humans, did there not come to you messengers from among you, reciting to you My verses and warning you of meeting this Day of yours?” They will say, “We testify against ourselves.” They were deluded by the life of this world, and they will testify against themselves that they were disbelievers. .

6,136,137,"They, the disbelievers of Mecca, assign to God, of the tillage, the crops, and the cattle which He 
multiplied. He created, a portion, which they dispense to visitors and the needy, and to their associates 
belongs a portion, which they dispense to such keepers [of the tillage and cattle], saying, ‘This is for 
God’ — so they assert (read bi-zamihim or bi-zumihim ) — ‘and this is for our associates’-, and if any of 
the portion of these [associates] fell into Gods portion, they used to restore it [to that of their associates], 
but when something of His portion fell into theirs, they would leave it there, saying, ‘God is Independent 
[and is not in need] of this’, as God, exalted be He, says: So that which is intended for their associates 
does not reach God, and that which is intended for God does reach their associates. Evil is that, provi¬ 
sion of theirs, which they decree! And thus, in the same way that what is mentioned was adorned for them, those associates of 
theirs, from among the jinn, have adorned for many of the idolaters the slaying of their children, by 
burying them alive ( shurakauhum, ‘those associates of theirs’, is read in the nominative as the subject of 
the verb zayyana, ‘adorned’; an alternative reading has the passive [zuyyina, ‘it has been adorned’], with 
qatlu, ‘the slaying’, in the nominative [as the subjedt of this passive verb], awladahum, ‘their children, in 
the accusative on account of it [being the direcft objecft of qatlu, ‘the slaying’], and shurakaihim in the 
genitive as an annexation to qatlu, so that the objecft in this case intervenes between the two elements of 
the annexation [qatlu awladahum shurakaihim, ‘their associates killing the children] — this is accept¬ 
able [syntactically] — and the annexation of qatlu to shurakaihim [in this latter reading] is on account 
of them [the associates] commanding [the idolaters to do] this), that they may destroy them and to con¬ 
fuse, to make obscure, their religion for them. Had God willed, they would not have done so; so leave 
them and that which they fabricate.","They assign to Allah a portion of the crops and livestock He created, saying, “This is for Allah” – as they claim – “and this is for our partners [i.e., idols].” But that which is assigned for their partners does not reach Allah, while that which is assigned for Allah reaches their partners[44]. How unfair their judgment is! . Similarly, the evil associates of the pagans have made the killing of their children[45] appealing to them, in order to lead them to destruction and confuse them in their faith. If Allah had willed, they would not have done that. So leave them to their fabrications.","[44] It was an Arab heathen ritual to allocate two shares out of their livestock; a share for God and a share for idols. If a portion of God’s share was mixed with that of their idols, they would not deduct it, saying that God is in no need of it. Yet if a portion of their idols’ share fell with that of God’s they would readily cut it and add it on to their idols’ share. . [45] Out of fear of poverty."

cannot therefore be ridden, such as the camels [they call] Sa’ibas or Harms, and cattle over which they 
do not invoke the Name of God’, when they slaughter them, invoking instead the names of their idols,

out of ignorance, without knowledge, and have forbidden what God has provided them, of what has 
been mentioned, in calumny again d God. Verily they have gone adray and are not guided.","They say, “These livestock and crops are reserved, none may eat them except those[46] whom we wish,” – as they claim – and there are livestock whose backs are forbidden [from labor][47], and livestock over whom they do not mention the name of Allah [while slaughtering] – fabricating lies against Him[48]. He will punish them for their lies. . They also say, “What is in the bellies of these livestock[49] is exclusively for our males and forbidden to our females, but if it is stillborn, they all will have a share in it. He will punish them for what they attribute[50]. He is All-Wise, All-Knowing. .

of maleness, then all males are forbidden; if on the basis of femaleness, then all females are so [forbid¬

can adduce for us?, that is, you have no such knowledge. You follow only supposition, in this [matter], 
merely guessing’, telling lies therein. Say, if you have no definitive argument, then: ‘To God belongs the conclusive argument, the 
perfect [one], for had He willed, to guide you, He could have guided all of you’. Say: ‘Come, bring forth, your witnesses, those who can testify that God has forbidden this’, 
which you have forbidden. Then if they testify, do not bear witness with them; and do not follow the 
whims of those who deny Our signs, those who do not believe in the Hereafter and ascribe equals to 
their Lord, associating others [with Him].","Those who associate partners with Allah will say, “If Allah had willed, neither we nor our forefathers would have associated anything with Him, nor would we have made anything forbidden[53].” Likewise, those who came before them rejected the truth until they tasted Our punishment. Say, “Do you have any knowledge that you can present to us? You follow nothing but assumption and you do nothing but lie. . Say, “Allah alone has the most conclusive argument. If He had willed, He could have guided you all.” . Say [O Prophet], “Bring your witnesses who can testify that Allah has forbidden all this.” If they testify, do not testify with them. Do not follow the desires of those who reject Our verses, and who disbelieve in the Hereafter, and they set up equals to their Lord.","[53] They falsely argue by citing predestination (al-qadar), when they were given the choice of choosing the right or wrong path."

may fear — We will provide for you and them — and that you do not draw near any ads of lewdness, 
grave sins, such as fornication, whether it be manifed or concealed, that is, [ads committed] overtly or

Do not kill your children for fear of poverty, for We provide for you and for them. Do not approach shameful acts, whether openly or in secret. Do not kill the soul sanctified by Allah, except lawfully. This is what He commands you, so that you may understand. . Do not approach the orphan’s property, except to improve it, until he attains maturity. Give full measure and weight with justice. We do not burden any soul beyond what it can bear. And maintain justice when you speak, even if it be about a close relative. And fulfill the covenant of Allah. This is what He commands you, so that you may take heed. . This is My straight path; follow it and do not follow other ways, lest they lead you away from His way. This is what He commands you, so that you may become righteous.”","[54] Monotheism (tawhīd) is the fountainhead of all virtue, whereas associating others with Allah (shirk) is the source of all evil."

and who, that is, none, does greater evil than he who denies God’s signs and turns away from them? We 
shall surely requite those who turn away from Our signs with dreadful, the mo St severe, chastisement 
for their aversion. Are they waiting — the deniers are indeed waiting — for nothing less than that the angels 
should come to them (read ta’tiyahum or ya’tiyahum), to seize their souls, or that your Lord, that is, 
His command, meaning His chastisement, should come, or that one of your Lord’s signs should come?, 
that is, those portents of His that indicate [the arrival of] the Hour? On the day that one of your Lord’s 
signs comes — and this is the rising of the sun from the weSt, as reported in the hadith of the two Sahihs

This [Qur’an] is a blessed Book which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allah, so that you may be shown mercy. . You [pagans] may no longer say, “Scriptures were only sent down to two groups before us, and we were unaware of their teachings.” . Or you would say, “If only the Scriptures had been sent down to us, we would have been better guided than they.” Now there has come to you a clear proof from your Lord, a guidance and a mercy. Who does greater wrong than he who denies the verses of Allah and turns away from them? We will recompense those who turn away from Our verses with the worst punishment, for their turning away. . Are they waiting for the coming of the angels, or the coming of your Lord, or the coming of some of your Lord’s signs[55]? On the Day when some of your Lord’s signs come, belief will be of no benefit to those who did not believe before, or those who did not do some good through their faith.

removed from mercy. As for those of them, of people, who follow you ( la-man, ‘as for those who’: the lam 
is for inceptiveness; or it is for introducing the oath, which is [the following]) I shall assuredly fill Hell 
with all of you’, that is, with you, through your seed, and with people — herein [in this address] those 
present have predominance over those absent (this [la^t] sentence [of the verse] expresses the sense of 
‘the requital’ [suggested] in the conditional man, ‘who’: in other words, ‘whoever follows you, then I shall 
punish him).","We surely created you, then shaped you, then We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they prostrated, except Iblīs [i.e., Satan], who was not one of those who prostrated[2]. . Allah said, “What prevented you from prostrating when I ordered you?” He said, “I am better than him; You created me from fire and created him from clay.” . Allah said, “Then get down from here! It is not for you to show arrogance[3] here. Get out, for you are one of the disgraced.” . He said, “Grant me respite until the Day they are resurrected.” . Allah said, “You are of those who are granted respite’’. . He said, “Since You have led me astray[4], I will certainly lie in wait for them on Your straight path. . Then I will come against them from their front and from their back, from their right and from their left[5], and You will not find most of them grateful.” . Allah said, “Get out of here, disgraced and expelled! I will certainly fill Hell with you and those who follow you all together.”","[2] See 2:34. . [3] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “None who has a mote’s weight of arrogance in his heart shall enter Paradise.” [Muslim: 91]. . [4] By citing predestination (al-qadar), Satan sets the record for being the first to use al-qadar as a pretext for not following Allah’s command (al-’amr) as an excuse to justify his rebelliousness against Him. . [5] This shows how purposeful and determined Satan really is in his mission. Such an enemy should be guarded against with constant vigilance."

the verb uskun, ‘dwell’, and to supplement to it [what follows]) and your wife. Eve (read Hawwa), in the 
Garden, and eat from whence you will, but do not come near this tree, to eat of it — and this was wheat

den ( wuriya: based on [the verbal form ]fuila and [derives] from [the infinitive] al-muwdrd) to them of 
their shameful parts. And he said, ‘Your Lord prohibited you from this tree only, in aversion, leSt you 
become angels ( malakayn may also be read malikayn ) or become immortals’, in other words, that is the 
necessary consequence of eating from it, as [is stated] in another verse: Shall I guide you to the Tree of 
Immortality and a kingdom that does not waSle away? [Q. 20:120]. And he swore to both of them, that is, he swore to both of them by God, ‘Tridy, I am a sincere 
adviser to you’, in this matter. Thus did he lead them on, [thus] did he debase them in their status, by delusion, on his part; 
and when they taSted of the tree, that is, [when] they ate of it, their shamefid parts were manifested to 
them, that is, the front [private part] of each was revealed to the other, as well as their behinds — each 
of these parts is called saw’a, ‘shameful’, because its exposure ‘shames’ ( yasu’u) that person — and they

themselves up therewith. And their Lord called them: ‘Did I not prohibit you from this tree, and say 
to you, “Verily Satan is a manifest enemy to you”?’, one whose enmity is evident? (the interrogative is 
meant as an affirmative). They said, ‘Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, by our aCt of disobedience, and if You do not 
forgive us and have mercy on us, we shall surely be among the loft’. Said He, ‘Go down, that is, Adam and Eve, with all those you comprise of your seed, each of you, 
each seed, an enemy to the other, on account of the wrong each does to the another. There will be for 
you on earth an abode, a place of settlement, and enjoyment for a while’, [until] your terms [of life] are 
fulfilled. Said He, ‘There, that is, [on] earth, you shall live, and there you shall die, and from there you 
shall be brought forth’, through the Resurrection (read aCtive takhrujun, ‘you shall come forth’, or passive 
tukhrajun, ‘you shall be brought forth’).","“O Adam, dwell in Paradise, you and your wife, and eat from wherever you wish, but do not approach this tree, or else you will both be among the wrongdoers.” . Then Satan whispered to them in order to expose what was hidden from them of their private parts. He said, “Your Lord has only forbidden to you this tree to prevent you from becoming angels or immortals.” . And he swore to them, “I am indeed your sincere adviser.” . So he deluded them both with deception. When they tasted the tree, their private parts became visible to them, so they began to put together leaves of the Garden to cover themselves. Their Lord called them, “Did I not forbid you from that tree and tell you that Satan is your sworn enemy?” . They said, “Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves; if You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will surely be among the losers.” . Allah said, “Get down as enemies to one another. You will find a dwelling place on earth and provision for an appointed time.” . He said, “There you will live, and there you will die, and from there you will be raised again.”",

Isfahanl, Mufradat, s.v. ‘w-‘-d’, 875f.) The phrase mostly appears in theological discussions about the fate of Muslim (grave) sinners 
in the Hereafter, and it is in this reSped: that the phrase found importance among the earliest: such polemics between Ash'arts and 
Mutazilis: the principle that God, being the Just, is obliged to fulfil His threat of everlasting punishment in the case of those who 
merit Hell — juSt as He is obliged to reward believers with everlasting Paradise — constitutes one of the five tenets of Mutazilism;

of the last is bashlr)' until, when they, the winds, hear heavy clouds, [clouds heavy] with rain, We lead 
it, that is, [We lead] the clouds (herein is a shift from the third [to the firSt] person), to a dead land, one 
devoid of any vegetation, in other words, [We lead it there] in order to revive it, and then We send down 
thereon, on that land, and bring forth thereby, by this water, fruits of every kind. Like that, bringing 
forth, We shall bring forth the dead, from their graves, through revivification, so that you might remem¬ 
ber, and believe. As for the good land, the one of rich soil, its vegetation comes forth, wholesomely, by permission 
of its Lord — this is a similitude of the believer who, when he hears an admonition, he [heeds it and] 
benefits from it. While as for the, one whose soil is, bad — the vegetation in, it comes forth only miser¬ 
ably, laboriously and with difficulty — this is the similitude of the disbeliever. Even, as We have made 
clear what has been mentioned, so We dispense. We make clear, the signs for a people who are thankful, 
to God and so believe.","It is He Who sends the winds as glad tidings ahead of His Mercy, until when they bear heavy clouds, We drive them to a lifeless land then We send down rain from it, producing thereby every kind of fruit. This is how We raise the dead, so that you may take heed. . Good land produces its vegetation by the Will of its Lord, but bad land only produces poor and scanty vegetation[21]. This is how We diversify the signs for people who give thanks.","[21] The ‘good land’ and ‘evil land’: The believers benefit from Allah’s signs are the ‘good’ ones, while disbelievers do not benefit are the ‘evil’ ones."
7,59,64,"Verily (laqad is the response to an oath that has been omitted) We sent Noah to his people, and he 
said, ‘O my people, worship God! You have no god other than Him (read ghayrihi as an adjeCtive of ilah, 
‘god’, or ghayruhu as a substitution in its place [sc. instead of min ildhin, ‘any god’)- Truly, I fear for you, 
if you worship other than Him, the chastisement of an Awful Day’, that is, the Day of Resurrection. The council, of the reSJjecfted elders, of his people, said: ‘Truly We see you in manifest error’. He said, ‘My people, there is no error in me ( dalala is more general than al-dalal, ‘misguidance’, 
and so to deny it is more effective than to deny the latter), but I am a messenger from the Lord of the 
Worlds. I convey to you (read ublighkum or uballighukum) the Messages of my Lord, and I am advising 
you, I desire good [for you] ,for I know from God what you know not. Do you then, deny, marvel that a reminder, an admonition, from your Lord should come to you 
through, the tongue of, a man from among you, that he may warn you, of chastisement if you do not 
believe, and that you may fear, God, and that you might be shown mercy’, by it? But they denied him, and so We delivered him and those with him, from drowning, in the Ark, 
[in] the ship, and We drowned those who denied Our signs, by means of the Flood. Truly they were a 
people blind, to the truth.","Indeed, We sent Noah to his people. He said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no god other than Him. I fear for you the punishment of a momentous Day.” . The chiefs of his people said, “We certainly see that you are clearly misguided.” . He said, “O my people, I am not misguided, but I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds. . I convey to you the messages of my Lord and give you sincere advice, and I know from Allah what you do not know. . Are you surprised that a reminder should come to you from your Lord through a man from among yourselves, so that he may warn you and you may fear Allah, and so that you may be shown mercy?” . But they rejected him, so We delivered him and those who were with him in the Ark, and We drowned those who rejected Our signs[22]. They were indeed people who were blind [to the truth].",[22] For more detail see 11:25-48.
7,65,72,"And, We sent, to, the earlier, c Ad their brother Hud. He said, ‘O my people, worship God, affirm His 
Oneness! You have no god other than Him. Will you not fear?’, will you [not] fear Him, and so believe? The council, those of his people who disbelieved, said: ‘We truly see you in folly, ignorance, and 
we truly deem you of the liars’, in your Message. He said, ‘O my people, there is no folly in me, but I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds. I convey to you the Messages of my Lord, and I am your truthful adviser, trustworthy in the 
Message [I convey]. Or do you marvel that a reminder from your Lord should come to you through, the tongue of, a 
man from among you, that he may warn you? And remember when He made you vicegerents, on earth, 
after the people of Noah, and increased your fiature in extension, in Strength and in height — (the tall-

truthful’, in what you say. He said, ‘Already, terror, chastisement, and wrath from your Lord have fallen, [they] muSt be 
[sent down], on you. Do you dispute with me concerning names which you have named, that is, with 
which you, you and your fathers, have named idols that you worship, for which, that is, for the worship 
of which, God has not revealed any warrant?, any definitive argument or proof? Then await, the chas¬ 
tisement. Truly I shall be with you waiting’, for that, on account of your denial of me: thus a blighting 
wind was unleashed againSt them [cf. Q. 51:4]. So We delivered him, namely, Hud, and those with him, from among the believers, by a mercy 
from Us, and We cut the root of those, people, who denied Our signs, that is. We extirpated them, and 
were not believers ( wa-ma kdnu mu’minina is a supplement to kadhdhabu, ‘[those who] denied’).","To the people of ‘Ād We sent their brother Hūd. He said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no god other than Him. Will you not then fear Him?” . The disbelieving chiefs of his people said, “Indeed, we see you as foolish, and we think you are one of the liars.” . He said, “O my people, there is no foolishness in me[23], but I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds, . I convey to you the messages of my Lord, and I am your sincere adviser. . Are you surprised that a reminder should come to you from your Lord through a man from among yourselves? Remember when He made you successors after the people of Noah and increased you amply in stature. Remember Allah’s favors, so that you may be successful.” . They said, “Have you come to tell us that we should worship Allah alone and abandon what our forefathers used to worship? Bring upon us what you are threatening us with[24] if you are truthful.” . He said, “You are definitely going to be subjected to the punishment and wrath of your Lord. Do you dispute with me concerning mere names[25] that you and your forefathers have made up which Allah has never authorized? Then wait; I am too waiting with you.” . Then We saved him[26] and those who were with him by Our mercy, and exterminated all those who rejected Our signs[27], for they would not believe.","[23] This calm, well-poised answer is a great example of how to deal with the ignorant. . [24] i.e., Allah’s punishment. . [25] i.e., false objects of worship. . [26] i.e., Prophet Hūd.
 [27] i.e., the people of ‘Ād."
7,73,79,"And, We sent, to Thamud ( Thamuda, read without declining [the noun], as denoting the tribe [of 
Thamud] itself) their brother Salih. He said, ‘O my people, worship God! You have no god other than 
Him. Truly there has come to you a clear proof, an illustration, 5 from your Lord, of my truthfulness, this

rock which they had designated. So leave her to feed throughout God’s earth, and do not touch her with 
harm, either by hamstringing or beating her, left you be seized by a painful chastisement. And remember how He made you vicegerents, on earth, after c Ad, and gave you habitations in 
the land, making caftles in its plains, in which you lodge during summer, and hewing its mountains 
into houses, in which you lodge during winter ( buyutan, ‘houses’, is in the accusative because of the 
implied circumstantial qualifier). So remember God’s bounties and do not be degenerate in the earth, 
seeking corruption’. Said the council of those of his people who waxed proud, [who] disdained belief in him, to those 
who were oppressed, to such of them as believed, that is, from among his people ( li-man amana minhum, 
‘to such of them as believed’, is a substitution for the preceding clause [li’lladhina iftud'ifu, ‘to those who 
were oppressed’], repeating the preposition [H-, ‘to’]): Are you aware that Salih has been sent, to you, 
from his Lord?’ They said, ‘Yes! Truly we believe in the Message with which he has been sent.’ Said the ones who were proud, ‘Truly we are disbelievers of that which you believe!’ The she-camel was given the water one day and then, another; but they soon tired of this: So they 
hamftrung the she-camel — Qudar hamstrung her by their command, killing her with a sword — and 
flouted the commandment of their Lord, and said, ‘O Salih, bring upon us that which you promised us, 
in the way of chastisement for [our] killing it, if you are indeed a messenger’. So the Trembling, a violent earthquake and a cry from the heaven, seized them, and they lay life¬ 
less proftrate in their habitations, keeled over their knees, dead. So he turned his back on them, Salih left [them], and said, ‘O my people, I have conveyed to you 
the Message of my Lord and gave you sincere advice, but you do not love sincere advisers’.","And to the people of Thamūd [We sent] their brother, Sālih. He said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no god other than Him. There has come to you a clear proof from your Lord: this is a she-camel[28] of Allah, as a sign to you. So leave her to graze in Allah’s land, and do not harm her in any way, or else a painful punishment will seize you. . Remember when He made you successors after ‘Ād and settled you in the land; you make palaces on its plains and carve homes in the mountains. So remember the bounties of Allah, and do not spread corruption in the land.” . The arrogant chiefs of his people said to those believers who were oppressed, “Do you really know that Sālih has been sent by his Lord?” They said, “We surely believe in what he has been sent with.” . Those who were arrogant said, “As for us, we surely disbelieve in what you believe.” . Then they killed the she-camel and defied their Lord’s command, and said, “Bring us what you are threatening us if you are indeed one of the messengers.” . Then an earthquake seized them, and they fell lifeless in their homes. . So he turned away from them, saying, “O my people, I did convey my Lord’s message to you and gave you sincere advice, but you do not like sincere advisers.”",[28] For more detail see 26:155-156.

from what is lawful to what is unlawful. And the response of his people was only that they said, ‘Expel them, that is, Lut and his follow¬ 
ers, from your city. Surely they are folk who would be pure!’, from [the abomination of penetrating] the 
rears of men. So We delivered him and his family, except his wife: she was of those who flayed behind, who 
remained in the chastisement. And We rained upon them a rain, the Stones of baked clay ( hijdrat al-sijjil), and it destroyed them. 
So behold what was the end of the sinners!","And [We sent] Lot, when he said to his people, “Do you commit such a shameful act[29] that nobody has ever done before you? . For you approach men lustfully instead of women; you are but a transgressing people[30].” . The only reply his people gave was to say, “Drive them out of your town, for they are people who keep themselves pure[31]!” . So We saved him and his family except his wife[32]; she was one of those who remained behind. . And We rained down upon them a rain [of brimstone]. So see how was the end of the evildoers.","[29] The only messenger mentioned here did not begin his call to worship Allah alone, due to the sheer vileness they were involved in, namely, sodomy. . [30] Because they transgressed the limits of moderation. . [31] Their only charge was that they were ‘pure’. . [32] Because she condoned the degrading behavior of her people, and she was a disbeliever."
7,85,93,"And, We sent, to Midian their brother Shu c ayb. He said, ‘O my people, worship God! You have 
no god other than Him. Verily there has come to you a clear proof, a miracle, from your Lord, to [prove] 
my truthfulness. So give full measure and weight and do not defraud, diminish [the value of], people’s 
goods, and do not work corruption in the earth, by way of unbelief and acfts of disobedience, after it has 
been set right, through the sending of messengers [thereto]. That, mentioned, is better for you, if you 
are believers, [if you are] seekers of faith, so haSten to it. And do not sit in every path, [every] route, threatening, terrifying people by seizing their gar¬

gion, those who believe in Him — when you threaten to kill them — and desiring that it, seeking that 
the path, be crooked. And remember when you were but few, and then He multiplied you. And behold 
what was the end of the agents of corruption, before you, for denying their messengers, that is, [behold] 
how deStrucftion was the conclusion of their affair. And if there is a party of you who believe in that with which I have been sent, and a party who do 
not believe, in it, then be patient, wait, until God judges between us, and you, by delivering the affirmer 
[of this truth] and destroying the denier [of it]. He is the befl of judges’, the faireSt of them. Said the council of those of his people who were disdainful, of believing: ‘Surely we will expel you, 
O Shu c ayb, and those who believe with you, from our city, unless you return to our creed’, our religion 
(the plural person predominates over the singular in their address [to Shu'ayb] because Shu'ayb was 
never part of their religious community; 8 and so in the same [plural] way he responded:) He said, ‘What, 
should we return to it, even though we are averse, to it? (the interrogative is meant as a disavowal). We woidd be forging a lie again fl God if we were to return to your creed, after God has delivered 
us from it. It is not, right,/or us to return to it, unless God our Lord wills, that [it be so] and forsakes us. 
Our Lord embraces all things through His knowledge, that is to say. His knowledge embraces all things, 
including my situation and yours. In God we have put our trufl. Our Lord, decide, adjudicate, between 
us and our people, for You are the befl of deciders’, adjudicators. Said the council of those of his people who disbelieved, that is, some said to others: ‘Verily if (la¬ 
in: the lam is for oaths) you follow ShiVayb, you shall indeed be losers’. So the Trembling, the violent earthquake, seized them, and they lay lifeless proflrate in their 
habitations, keeled over their knees, dead. 

6 The Bulaq edition does not give the variant innakum, but the modern edition includes it, since it is a recognised variant of a- 
innakum : the verse, in other words, is either a follow-up question to the previous one, or an affirmative statement.

8 Shu'ayb’s identification with ‘Jethro’ of the Old Testament, Moses’s father-in-law, although accepted by many, remains contested. 
He is also known as ‘Ruel’. His Syriac name is Yatrun. The name Shu'ayb has been retained throughout the translation. For a good 
summary of the reasons for contesting this identification, see ‘A. Yusuf Ali’s comments in the footnotes to Q. 7:85, in his famous 
translation, Lite Holy Qur’an. See also Tha'labl, Arais al-Majalisfi Qisas al-Anbiya or “Lives of the Prophets”, trans.William Brinner

Sura al-A‘raf Those who denied Shu c ayb ( alladhina kadhdhabu Shuayban, this constitutes the subjecft [of the 
sentence], the predicate of which is [introduced by the following ka-an, ‘as if’]), it is as if (ka-an, has 
been softened, its subjecft omitted, in other words [understand it as] ka-annahum) they had never dwelt, 
[never] had residence, there, in those dwelling-places of theirs; those who denied Shu c ayb, they were the 
losers (the emphasis effecfted by the repetition of the relative clause [alladhina kadhdhabu Shuayban, 
‘those who denied Shu'ayb’] and what follows it is intended as a refutation of what they had said previ¬ 
ously [sc. ‘if you follow Shu'ayb, you shall indeed be losers’]). S° he turned back on them, and said, ‘O my people, I have conveyed to you the Messages of my 
Lord and advised you sincerely, but you believe not: so why should I grieve for a disbelieving people?’ 
(the interrogative is meant [rhetorically] as a negation).","And to the people of Midian [We sent] their brother Shu‘ayb. He said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no god other than Him. There has come to you a clear proof from your Lord. Give full measure and weight, and do not defraud people of their property[33], and do not spread corruption in the land after it has been set aright. That is best for you, if you are [truly] believers. . Do not lie in wait on every path, threatening and preventing from Allah’s path[34] those who believe in Him, and seeking to make it crooked. Remember when you were few, then He increased you in number. See how was the end of those who spread corruption. . If there are some among you who believe in what I have been sent with, while others do not believe, then be patient until Allah judges between us, and He is the Best of Judges.” . The arrogant chiefs of his people said, “O Shu‘ayb, we will surely drive you and those who believe with you out of our town unless you return to our faith.” He said, “Even if we detest it? . We would be fabricating lies against Allah if we were to return to your faith after Allah has saved us from it. We will not return to it unless Our Lord Allah so wills. Our Lord has full knowledge of everything. In Allah we put our trust. Our Lord, judge between us and our people with truth, for You are the Best of the Judges.” . The disbelieving chiefs of his people said, “If you follow Shu‘ayb, you will certainly be losers[35].” . Then they were seized by the earthquake and they fell lifeless in their homes. . Those who rejected Shu‘ayb became as if they had never lived there. Those who rejected Shu‘ayb were themselves the losers[36]. . So he turned away from them and said, “O my people, I did convey to you the messages of my Lord, and gave you sincere advice. Why should I grieve for a disbelieving people?”","[33] Their sin was wantonly engaging in swindling defraud in dealings. . [34] They were also engaged in highway robberies and preventing people from listening to Shu‘ayb. . [35] In financial terms. . [36] Not the believers as they claimed, as they lost both worlds."
7,94,95,"And We did not send a prophet to any city but that, when they denied him, We seized. We pun¬ 
ished, its people with misery, abjecft poverty, and hardship, illness, so that they might be humble, [so that 
they might be] self-effaced, and so believe. Then We gave them in place of evil, the chastisement, good, wealth and health, until they multi¬ 
plied, and said, out of ingratitude towards this grace: ‘Hardship and happiness befell our fathers before’, 
juSt as it has befallen us, and this is nothing but the habit of time, and not the consequence of God, so 
remain firm in what you follow. God, exalted be He, says: So We seized them, with the chastisement, 
suddenly, while they perceived not, beforehand the time of its coming.","We have not sent any prophet to a town, but We seized its people with poverty and adversity, so that they may humble themselves. . Then We changed their adversity into prosperity until they flourished and said, “Our forefathers were also afflicted with hardship and ease.” Then We seized them by surprise while they were unaware.",
7,96,102,"Yet had the people of the towns, the deniers, believed, in God and the messengers [sent] to them,

la-fatahna or la-fattahna) blessings from the heaven, by way of rain, and earth, by way of vegetation; 
but they denied, the messengers, and so We seized them. We punished them, on account of what they 
used to earn. Do the people of the towns, the deniers, feel secure from the coming of Our might. Our chastise¬ 
ment, upon them at night while they are sleeping?, unaware of it? Or, do the people of the towns feel secure from the coming of Our might upon them in the day¬ 
time while they are playing? And so do they feel secure from God’s plotting?, that is, His drawing them on by degrees, through 
graces, and then seizing them suddenly. 9 None feels secure from God’s plotting but the people who are 
losers. Has it not been shown, [has it not] become clear, to those who inherit the earth, as a [place of] 
habitation, after, the deStrucftion of, those who inhabited it that, (an is the softened form and constitutes 
the subjecft [of the verb], its noun having been omitted, in other words [understand it as] annahu ), if 
We will, We could smite them, with chastisement, for their sins?, as We smote those before them? (the

have been inserted in two instances [each], are meant to indicate a supplement; a variant reading [for 
a-wa-amina\ has aw amina, ‘or do [they] feel secure’, in the [second] instance, 11 as a supplement). And, 
We, seal up their hearts so that they do not hear, the admonition, in a way so as to reflecft. Those towns, which have been mentioned, We relate to you, O Muhammad (s), some of their 
tidings, [some of] the Stories of their peoples. Verily their messengers brought them clear proofs, mani¬ 
fest miracles, but they would not believe, when these [signs] came to them, in what they had denied, 
disbelieved in, before, before these [signs] came to them; nay, they persisted in disbelief. Thus does God 
seal up the hearts of the disbelievers.

Tafsir al-Jalalayn And We did not find in moft of them, that is, people, any covenant, that is, any loyalty to a cov¬ 
enant from the day the pledge was made. Nay ( wa-in: in is softened) We found that mo ft of them were 
indeed wicked.","If only the people of the towns had believed and feared Allah, We would have certainly opened for them blessings from the heaven and earth. But they disbelieved, so We seized them for what they earned. . Do the people of the towns feel secure that Our punishment will not befall them by night while they are asleep? . Or do the people of the towns feel secure that Our punishment will not befall them by day while they are at play? . Do they feel secure from the plan of Allah? None can feel secure from the plan of Allah[37] except the loser people. . Is it not clear to those who inherit the land after its former people that, if We so willed, We could punish them for their sins and seal up their hearts so that they do not hear[38]? . These are the towns, some of whose stories We relate to you. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they were not about to believe in what they had already rejected[39]. This is how Allah seals up the hearts of the disbelievers. . We did not find most of them committed to their covenant; rather We found most of them rebellious.","[37] Even the most devout believers, as hearts are between the two Fingers of Allah, He directs it wherever He wishes. . [38] For they do not benefit from what they hear. . [39] i.e., they persistently denied warnings given to them."

to Pharaoh and his council, his folk, but they miflreated, they disbelieved in, them. So behold what was 
the end of those who work corruption, by way of disbelief, when they were destroyed. And Moses said, ‘O Pharaoh, I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds, to you, but he 
denied him. So he [Moses] said: I am, one for whom it is right, [for whom] it is appropriate, to say nothing but the truth about 
God (a variant reading [for ‘aid] has ‘alayya, ‘for me’, in which case, haqiqun, ‘it is right’, is the subject

God’]). Truly I have come to you with a clear proof from your Lord. So send forth with me, to Syria, the 
Children of Israel’: he [Pharaoh] had enslaved them. Said he. Pharaoh, to him: ‘Ifyou have come with a sign, as you claim, then produce it, if you are 
of those who fpeak the truth’, in this. Then he cafl down his fluff and lo! it was a serpent, manifeft [for all to see], an enormous 
snake. And he drew forth his hand, he took it out from his bosom, and lo! it was white, radiant, for the 
beholders, and not its usual skin colour.","Then We sent after them Moses[40] with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they wrongfully rejected them. See how was the end of those who spread corruption. . Moses said, “O Pharaoh, I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds. . I am obliged to say nothing concerning Allah except the truth. I have come to you with clear proof from your Lord, so let the Children of Israel go[41] with me.” . Pharaoh said, “If you have brought a sign, then bring it forth if you are truthful.” . So he threw his staff, and it suddenly became a real serpent[42]. . And he drew out his hand, and it was shining white[43] to the beholders.","[40] Moses’ story is recounted in detail in many surahs, for his mission bears the most similarities with that of the Prophet (ﷺ). .

In ancient Egypt, the cobra snake, known as the uraeus, was used as a symbol of sovereignty and divine authority worn on the headdresses and crowns. . [43] As a miracle from Allah. The hands of the Children of Israel used to be rough and scratchy out of labor and toil for their masters, for they were bondsmen and slaves."

it in consultation with him, who would expel you from your land. So what do you command?’ They said, ‘Put him and his brother off a while, postpone [any decision regarding] their affair, 
and send into the towns summoners, gatherers, to bring you every cunning sorcerer’ ( sdhir: a variant reading has sahhdr) to outdo Moses in the 
art of magic. And so they summoned [them].","The chiefs among Pharaoh’s people said, “This is indeed a learned magician! . He seeks to drive you out of your land. [Pharaoh said], “So what do you advise?” . They said, “Let him and his brother wait for a while and send heralds to the cities . to bring you every learned magician.”",
7,113,126,"And the sorcerers came to Pharaoh, saying, ‘Surely ( a-inna: read pronouncing both hamzas, or 
by not pronouncing the second one, but inserting an alif between the two in both cases) there will be a 
wage for us if we are the vidors?’ He said, ‘Yes, and indeed you shall be of those brought near’. They said, ‘O Moses, either you cafl, your Staff, or we shall be the cafters!’, of what we have. He said, ‘Caft!’, this is a command permitting them to caSt firSt, as a means to manifesting the 
truth. And when they cafl, their ropes and Staffs, they put a fpell upon the people’s eyes, misleading them 
from perceiving the real State of these [ropes and Staffs], and overawed them, scared them, by making 
them appear to be slithering snakes, and produced a mighty sorcery. And We revealed to Moses [saying]: ‘Cafl your ftaff.’ And lo! it swallowed up (read talaqqafu, 
with one of the original ta letters [of tatalaqqafu] omitted) 12 the illusion they were creating, that which 
they were transforming by delusion. Thus did the truth come to pass, [thus was it] confirmed and made manifest; and that which they

were doing, in the way of sorcery, was proved false. Thus were they, that is, Pharaoh and his folk, there defeated, becoming humiliated — they ended 
up abased. And the sorcerers fell down in prostration. They said, ‘We believe in the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of Moses and Aaron’, for they realised that what they had witnessed of the ktaff could 
not be done through sorcery. Pharaoh said, ‘Have you believed (a-amantum, read pronouncing both hamzas, and replacing 
the second one with an alif) in him, in Moses, before I gave you leave? Surely this, that you have done, 
is a plot you have plotted in the city that you may expel its people from it. But you shall come to know, 
what I will do to you! I shall assuredly have your hands and feet cut off on opposite sides, that is, the right hand and 
the left foot of every one, then I shall have every one of you crucified’. They said, ‘Surely to our Lord, after our death, however it come about, we shall be restored, we 
shall return, in the Hereafter. You are vindictive, ,<]iiteful, towards us only because we have believed in the signs of our Lord 
when they came to us. Our Lord, pour out onto us patience (and constancy), when that with which he has 
threatened us comes to pass, left: we revert to unbelief; and take us to You as men who have submitted’.","The magicians came to Pharaoh and said, “Will we have a reward if we prevail?” . He said, “Yes, and you will surely be of those who are close to me.” . They said, “O Moses, will you throw first or will we be the first to throw?” . He said, “You throw first.” So when they threw, they enchanted the eyes of the people and struck terror into them, and produced a powerful magic. . We inspired Moses, “Throw your staff,” and it suddenly swallowed up all their illusionary devices. . Thus the truth prevailed, and all what they did was proven to be false. . They were defeated right there and were utterly humiliated. . The magicians fell down in prostration, . and said, “We believe in the Lord of the worlds, . the Lord of Moses and Aaron.” . Pharaoh said, “How dare you believe in him before I give you permission! This is indeed a plot that you devised in the city to drive out its people, but you will soon come to know. . I will surely cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, then I will crucify you all together.” . They said, “We are surely returning to our Lord. . Your only vengeance against us is because we believed in the signs of our Lord when they came to us[44]. Our Lord, shower upon us patience and let us die as Muslims, submitting to You.”",[44] It implies deriding Pharaoh for his skewed standards.
7,127,129,"Then the council of Pharaoh’s folk said, to him [to Pharaoh]: ‘Will you leave Moses and his 
people to work corruption in the land, by calling to disobedience againft: you, and flout you and your 
gods?’ — he had fashioned small idols for them to worship, and had said to them, ‘I am your lord and 
their lord’, which is why he says, I am your lord the highest [Q. 79:24]. He said, ‘We shall slaughter (read 
nuqattilu or naqtulu ) their, new-born, sons and Spare their women, keeping them alive [for us], as we 
did with them before. For surely we have [irresistible]power over them!’, and they did this to them, and 
so the Children of Israel grieved. Moses said to his people, ‘Seek help in God and be patient, their persecution. Surely the earth is 
God’s and He bequeaths it, He gives it, to whom He will from among His servants. The, praiseworthy, 
sequel belongs to those who are wary, of God’. They said, ‘We suffered harm before you came to us, and since you have come to us.’ He said, 
‘Perhaps your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you successors in the land, that He may observe 
how you shall aCl’, in it.","The chiefs among Pharaoh’s people said, “Will you leave Moses and his people to spread corruption in the land, and abandon you and your gods?” He said, “We will kill their sons and spare their women, for we have full dominance over them.” . Moses said to his people, “Seek help from Allah and be patient. The earth belongs to Allah; He gives it as an inheritance to whom He wills of His slaves, but the outcome is for those who fear Allah.” . They said, “We were oppressed before you came to us and after you came.” He said, “It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you successors in the land to see how you will do.”",
7,130,136,"And verily We seized Pharaoh’s folk with the years, of drought, and dearth of fruits, so that they 
might remember, [that they might] heed the admonition, and become believers. But whenever a good thing, [such as] fertility and abundance, befell them, they said, ‘This be¬ 
longs to us’, that is, we deserve it, and they did not give thanks for it; and whenever an evil thing, [such 
as] drought or hardship, smote them, they would augur ill of Moses and those, believers, with him. 
Surely their ill augury is with God, Who brings it upon them, but moSt of them do not know, that what¬ 
ever befalls them is from Him. And they said, to Moses, ‘Whatever sign you bring us, to caSta Spell upon us therewith, we will 
not believe in you’, and so he [Moses] invoked God againft: them. So We unleashed upon them the flood, of water, which penetrated their houses and which for 
seven days would come up to people’s necks as they sat; and the locuSts, which consumed their crops

and fruits, likewise [engulfing them for seven days]; and the lice ( al-qummal is like al-sus, ‘woodworm’, 
or al-qurad, ‘ticks’), which would follow [and consume] what the locusts left behind; and the frogs, such 
that they infected their houses and food supplies; and the blood, [flowing] in their water, diStind, clear, 
signs: but they were too scornfid, to believe in them, and were a sinfidfolk. And when the terror, the chastisement, fell upon them, they said, ‘O Moses, pray to your Lord 
for our sake by the covenant which He has made with you, to remove the chastisement from us if we 
believe. Indeed if (la-in: the l dm is for oaths) you remove from us the terror, verily we will believe in you 
and let the Children of Israel go with you’. But when We removed, through the supplication of Moses, the terror from them to a term which 
they should reach, lo! they were already reneging, breaking their covenant and persisting in their dis¬ 
belief. So We exacted retribution from them and therefore We drowned them in the sea (al-yamm de¬ 
notes salty waters) for, the reason, that they denied Our signs and were heedless of them, not reflecting 
upon them.","We afflicted the people of Pharaoh with famine and poor harvests, so that they may take heed. . When prosperity came their way, they said, “This is what we deserve[45],” but when adversity befell them, they ascribed it to the misfortune of Moses and those who were with him. Indeed, their misfortune is decreed by Allah, but most of them do not know. . They said, “No matter what sign you may bring to enchant us, we are not going to believe in you.” . So We sent upon them flood, locusts, lice, frogs and blood – as clear signs, yet they persisted in arrogance and were a wicked people. . When a scourge befell them, they said, “O Moses, call upon your Lord for us by virtue of the covenant He has made to you; if you remove the scourge from us, we will surely believe in you and will let the Children of Israel go with you.” . But when We removed the scourge from them until an appointed term that they were bound to reach, they broke their promise. . So We subjected them to retribution and drowned them in the sea because they rejected Our signs and were heedless of them.","[45] Out of egotism and smugness, they felt they deserved all good things."
7,137,137,"And We bequeathed upon the people who were oppressed, through bondage, namely, the Chil¬ 
dren of Israel, the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof which We had blessed, with 
water and trees ( allati bdraknd fihd, ‘which We had blessed’, is an adjectival qualification of al-ard, ‘the 
land’), and this was Syria, and the fair word of your Lord was fulfilled, which was His saying, exalted

28:5], for the Children of Israel because they endured patiently, persecution at the hands of their enemy; 
and We destroyed utterly what Pharaoh and his folk had been creating, by way of architecture, and 
what they had been erecting (read yarishim or yarushun), [what they had been] raising of edifices.","And We made the people who had been oppressed to inherit the lands of the east and west that We had blessed. The good word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because of what they endured patiently, and We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people used to make and what they used to construct.",
7,138,140,"And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea, and they came upon, they passed by, a 
people cleaving in devotion (read yakufun or ya’kifun) to idols they had, constantly worshipping them.

you are an ignorant folk, for repaying God’s grace to you with what you have said. Truly as for these, their way will be destroyed and what they have been doing is in vain’. He said, ‘Shall I seek other than God as a god for you, to worship (abghikum, ‘[shall] Iseekfor 
you’, is originally abghi lakum ), when He has favoured you above all the worlds?’, of your time, in the 
ways He has mentioned in His sayings?","We led the Children of Israel across the sea, then they came upon a people who were devoted to their idols. They said, “O Moses, make for us a god just as they have gods.” He said, “You are indeed an ignorant people. . Indeed, what they follow is doomed to destruction and what they do is worthless.” . He said, “Shall I seek for you a god[46] other than Allah when He has favored you above the worlds?”","[46] i.e., an object of worship."

We would Speak to him, after he has faSted [during that period]; that was the month of Dhti’l-Qa'da. He 
completed the faSt. But when it came to an end, he disliked the [bad] odour of his mouth and so cleaned 
his teeth. God then commanded him [to faSt for] another ten nights so that He may Speak to him deSpite 
the odour in his mouth: as God says, and completed them with ten, nights of Dhu’l-Hijja. Thus was the 
time appointed by his Lord concluded, the time at which God had promised him to Speak to him, as 
forty ( arbaina is a circumstantial qualifier) nights (laylatan is for Specification); and Moses said to his 
brother Aaron, when he was departing to the Mount for the communion [with his Lord]: ‘Succeed me, 
be my deputy, over my people, and be righteous, [among them] with regard to their affair, and do not 
follow the way of the agents of corruption’, by consenting with them to ads of disobedience.

Sura al-A‘raf And when Moses came at Our appointed time, that is, the time at which We had promised to 
S]ieak to him, and his Lord Cpoke with him, without any intermediary, with Speech which he heard from 
all directions, he said, ‘My Lord! Show me. Yourself, that I may behold You!’ Said He, ‘You shall not see 
Me, that is to say, you do not have the power to see me, the use of this expression [lan tardni, ‘you shall 
not see Me] instead of lan urd, ‘I shall not be seen, implies that it is possible to see God, exalted be He; 
but behold the mountain, which is stronger than you are, and if it remains, Mays fixed, in its place, then 
you shall see Me’, that is, [then] you shall remain fixed [able] to see Me, otherwise, you will not have the 
capacity [for it]. And when his Lord revealed Himself, that is, [when] He manifested of His Light the 
equivalent of half a nail of a little finger, as Stated in one hadith verified by al-Hakim, to the mountain He 
levelled it to the ground (read dakkan or dakka’a, meaning madkukan) and Moses fell down senseless, 
having loSt consciousness at the awesomeness of what he had seen. And when he recovered his senses 
he said, ‘Glory be to You!, in Your transcendence. I repent to You, for having asked You what I was not 
commanded [to ask], and I am the fir & of the believers’, of my time.","We appointed for Moses thirty nights and completed it with ten more, whereby the term of forty nights set by Allah was fulfilled. Moses said to his brother Aaron, “Take my place among my people in my absence, keep things right, and do not follow the way of those who spread corruption.” . When Moses came at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, “My Lord, reveal Yourself to me so that I may look at You.” Allah said, “You will not be able to see Me[47]. But look at the mountain; if it stays firm in its place, only then will you see Me.” When his Lord appeared to the mountain, it was leveled to dust and Moses fell unconscious. When he recovered, he said, “Glory be to You! I repent to You and I am the first of the believers.”",[47] None can see Allah in the life of this world.
7,144,145,"He, God, said, to him: ‘O Moses, I have elected you, chosen you, from among mankind, the 
people of your time, for My Messages (read plural, bi-risdldti, or singular, bi-risdlati, ‘for My Message’) 
and My Speech, that is, [for] My having Spoken to you. So take what I have given you, of bounty, and be 
of the thankfid’, of My favours. And We inscribed for him in the Tablets, that is, the Tablets of the Torah — these were made 
from the Lote-tree of Paradise, or of chrysolite or emerald, and they were either seven or ten — about 
all things, one needs in religion, as an admonition and a detailing, an explanation, of all things (li-kulli 
shay’in substitutes for the previous genitive construction [min kulli shay’, ‘about all things’]). ‘Take it 
then (there is an implicit qulna, ‘We said’, before this [fa-kudhha, ‘take it then’]) firmly, seriously and 
earnestly, and enjoin your people to adhere to the fairest [precepts] in it. I shall show you the abode of 
the wicked, [of] Pharaoh and his followers, and that is Egypt, that you may take an example from them.","He said, “O Moses, I have chosen you above other people, by giving you My messages and speaking to you. So hold fast to what I have given you, and be of those who are grateful.” . We inscribed for him in the Tablets admonition of all things and explanation of everything. “Hold fast to them and ask your people to follow the best of it. I will show you the home of the rebellious[48].",[48] A severe warning against rebellion.
7,146,147,"I shall turn away from My signs, the proofs of My power, in the way of creations and other¬ 
wise, those who behave arrogantly in the earth without right, by humiliating them so that they do not 
magnify themselves; and if they see every sign do not believe in it, and if they see the way, the path, of 
rettitude, the guidance that has come from God, do not adopt it as a way, to follow, and if they see the 
way of error, misguidance, adopt it as a way. That, turning [of them] away, is because they have denied 
Our signs and were heedless of them. A similar Statement has been made above. Those who deny Our signs and the encounter in the Hereafter, the Resurrection and so on. their 
works, the good deeds they performed in the world, such as the maintenance of kinship ties or voluntary 
almsgivings, have failed, are invalid, and will not be rewarded, since they are not binding [in this case]. 
Shall they, they shall not, be requited anything but, the requital [for], what they used to do?’, in the way 
of denial and acfts of disobedience?","I will turn away from My signs those who are arrogant[49] in the land without any right. Even if they see every sign, they will still not believe in it; if they see the way of guidance, they will not follow it, but if they see the way of misguidance, they will follow it as their way. That is because they have rejected Our signs and were heedless of them. . Those who reject Our signs and the meeting of the Hereafter, their deeds will become worthless. Will they not be recompensed except for what they used to do?","[49] Arrogance is pointed out as a major cause for disbelief, as the arrogant will not hearken to admonition or to advice."
7,148,149,"And the people of Moses, after him, that is, after he had departed for the communion [with God], 
made of their ornaments, which they had borrowed from Pharaoh’s folk on the pretext of a wedding 
celebration, and which remained in their possession, a calf, which the Samaritan had fashioned for them 
therefrom; a [mere] living body (jasadan is a substitution [for ‘ijlan, ‘a calf’]), of flesh and blood, which 
lowed, that is, [which] made audible sounds [like a cow]: it [the calf] was transformed in this way when 
the duSt, which he [the Samaritan] had collected from [where] the hoof of Gabriel’s Steed [had trodden], 
was placed in its mouth, for it has the effect of [giving] life to that in which it is placed (the second direct 
object of the verb ittakhadha, ‘[they] made’, has been omitted, but it would be ildhan, ‘[as] a god’). Did 
they not see that itCpoke not to them, nor guided them to any way?, so how can it be taken as a god? Yet 
they took it as such, a god, and were evildoers, for taking it so. And when they became at a loss, that is, [when] they became remorseful for having worshipped 
it, and saw, [and] realised, that they had gone aftray, thereby, and this was after Moses’s return [from 
the communion], they said, ‘Unless our Lord is merciful to us and forgives us (read both [verbs] either 


147 


Tafsir al-Jalalayn 

in the third person singular or in the second person singular), 13 verily we shall be among the losers’.","In his absence, the people of Moses took for worship an image of calf made from their jewelry that made a lowing sound. Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor could it guide them[50] to any [straight] way? Yet they took it for worship and they were wrongdoers. . When they became remorseful and realized that they had gone astray, they said, “If our Lord does not have mercy upon us and forgive us, we will certainly be among the losers.”","[50] This mere body even lacked the basic attributes of being a god, as it was unable to speak to them or benefit them."
7,150,153,"And when Moses returned to his people, angry, because of them, and bitterly grieved, he said, 
to them: ‘Evil is that, that is, evil is the [manner of] succession, which you have followed in my place, 
after I had gone, this idolatry of yours. Would you hasten on the judgement of your Lord?’ And he caSt 
down the Tablets, the Tablets of the Torah, angry for the sake of his Lord, and they were broken into 
pieces, and he seized his brother by the head, that is, by the hair, with his right hand, and [seized him] by 
the beard, with his left hand, dragging him toward him, in anger. He said, ‘O, son of my mother! (read 
either ibna ummi or ibna umma, by which he meant [the standard form of saying ‘my mother’] ummv. 
the mention of her is more affectionate [in appealing] to his heart), Truly the people judged me weak 
and they were close to killing me. Do not make my enemies gloat over my misfortune, to rejoice thereat, 
by your humiliating me, and do not count me among the folk who have done evil’, by worshipping the 
calf, in [your] reproach [of them]. He said, ‘My Lord, forgive me, what I have done to my brother, and my brother, he includes him 
in the supplication in order to reconcile him and to fend off any gloating over his misfortune, and admit 
us into Your mercy, for You are the MoSt Merciful of the merciful’. God, exalted be He, says, ‘Surely those who chose the calf, as a god. wrath, chastisement, and 
abasement shall come upon them from their Lord in the life of this world-, and so they were punished 
[for this deed] by the command to slay themselves, and abasement was Stamped upon them until the 
Day of Resurrection. Even, as We have requited them, so We requite those who invent lies, againSt God 
by way of idolatry and otherwise. But those who commit evil deeds and repent, desiSt from them, thereafter and believe, in God — 
indeed your Lord thereafter, that is, after repentance, is truly Lorgiving, Merciful’, towards them.","When Moses returned to his people, furious and grieved, he said, “What an evil thing you did in my absence! Did you seek to hasten the command of your Lord[51]?” He threw the Tablets[52] and grabbed his brother by the hair, dragging him towards himself. Aaron said, “O son of my mother, the people overpowered me and were about to kill me. Do not make my enemies rejoice over me, nor count me among the people of wrongdoing.” . Moses said, “My Lord, forgive me and my brother[53], and admit us into Your mercy, for You are the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.” . As for those who took the calf for worship, they will certainly be afflicted with wrath from their Lord and disgrace in the life of this world. This is how We recompense those who invent falsehood. . But those who commit evil deeds, then repent thereafter and [truly] believe, then your Lord is indeed All-Forgiving[54], Most Merciful.","[51] i.e., “Could you not have waited until I came back to you with your Lord’s good guidance?”.
 [52] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Hearing is not like seeing. Allah told Moses of what his people did with the calf and he did not throw down the tablets. Yet, when he actually saw what they did he threw them down!” [Imām Aḥmad: 2447; Ibn Hibbān: 6213] . [53] He practically apologized to his brother and accepted his explanation. . [54] This shows that no matter how grave the sin is, Allah will forgive it if the person truly repents and believes."
7,154,156,"And when Moses’s anger abated, subsided, he took the Tablets, which he had caSt down, and in 
their copy, that is, [in] what was inscribed upon them — in other words, it was written that: there was 
guidance, from error, and mercy for all those who hold their Lord in awe, [who] have fear [of Him] (the 
lam [in li-rabbihim, ‘their Lord’] has been inserted into the direCt objeCt because it [the direCt objeCt] has 
preceded [the verb]). And Moses chose of his people seventy men, from among those who had not worshipped the 
calf, by God’s command, for Our appointed time, that is, for the time at which We promised him that 
they should come and apologise for their comrades’ worship of the calf. He [Moses] then departed with 
them; but when the Trembling, a violent earthquake, seized them, Ibn ‘Abbas said, ‘ [That earthquake 
was] because they did not separate themselves from their people when the latter took to worshipping 
the calf’; he [Ibn ‘Abbas] added, ‘These [people] were not the same ones who asked to see God and were 
struck by the thunderbolt [cf. Q. 2:55]’, he, Moses, said, ‘My Lord, had You willed You would have de¬ 
stroyed them long before, that is, before my departure with them, so that the Children of Israel might see 
this and not make [false] accusations against me, and me [with them]. Will You destroy us for what the 
foolish ones among us have done? (this interrogative is meant as a plea for compassion, in other words, 
‘Do not punish us for the sins of others’). It, that is, the trial which the ignorant ones underwent, is but 
Your trial. Your test, whereby You send aStray whom You will, to lead stray, and guide whom You will, 
to guide. You are our Protestor, looking after our affairs, so forgive us and have mercy on us, for You are 
the BeSl of all who show forgiveness. And prescribe for us, grant [us], in this world good and in the Hereafter, good. We have turned, 
repented, to You’. He, God, says: ‘My chastisement — I smite with it whom I will, to chastise, and My 
mercy embraces, subsumes, all things, in this world, and so I shall prescribe it, in the Hereafter, for those 
who are God-fearing and pay the alms, and those who believe in Our signs; 

13 It should be pointed out — for the commentary omits it — that in the case of the second person singular reading, rabbuna would 
have to change to the accusative (vocative) rabbana. In other words, either read yarhamna rabbuna wa-yaghfir land, or tarhamnd 
rabband wa-taghfir land,' [Unless] You, our Lord, are merciful to us and forgive us ...’ (cf. Ibn Mujahid, Qird’dt, 294).

Sura al-Afdf","When Moses’ fury calmed down, he picked up the Tablets; in their inscription there was guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord. .

This is not but a trial from You, by which You cause to stray whom You will and guide whom You will. You are our Guardian, so forgive us and have mercy upon us, for You are the Best of Forgivers. . Ordain for us good in this life and in the Hereafter, for We have turned to You in repentance.” Allah said, “As for my punishment, I will afflict with it whom I will[56], but My mercy encompasses everything; I will ordain it for those who fear Me, and give zakah, and those who believe in Our verses[57],","[55] When they reached the appointed place, they said to Moses, ""O Moses, we will never believe you until we see Allah openly.""

circumstantial qualifier) tribes ( asbatan substitutes for this [previous circumstantial qualifier]) com¬ 
munities ( umaman substitutes for the preceding [asbatan, ‘tribes’). And We revealed to Moses, when his 
people asked him for water, in the wilderness, [saying]: ‘Strike the rock with your Staff’, and he Struck it,

in the wilderness, from the heat of the sun, and We sent down to them manna and quails — which are 
[respectively, a type of citrus] turunjabin, and the quail and We said to them: ‘Eat of the good things We 
have provided for you.’ And they did not wrong Us, but they wronged themselves. And, mention, when it was said to them, ‘Dwell in this city, the Holy House [of Jerusalem], and

14 Muslim tradition generally understands the expression umml as ‘illiterate’, or ‘who cannot read or write’, or ‘unlettered’. Some 
modern scholarship is critical of this meaning, suggesting that it actually referred to the Prophet’s Status with regard to the Abra- 
hamic tradition, namely, that ‘one not of those who read the Scriptures’, or ‘gentile’. 

15 With the passive reading tughfar, the subject of the verb muSt then go into the nominative, khatiatukum. 

16 Here, as in Q. 2:104 and Q. 4:46, the effect of such verbal distortions is loSt in translation, the terms in question being hittatun 
and habbatun. This problem, of course, is compounded by the faCt that one cannot be sure if the Qur’anic allusion is actually to 
an original Hebrew term or to its Arabic equivalent (the Arabic root h-t-t does exist, meaning, ‘to put down’ or ‘to unburden’). As 
regards the term hitta, this is said to have been a formula which the tribes of Israel were required to repeat as a teSt before entering 
the gate of Jerusalem (or Jericho?) — or, as U. Rubin has pointed out — before crossing the River Jordan, in accordance with Judges 
12:5-6 (where the word is shibboleth = Arabic, sunbula, ‘ear of corn’). The gloss habbatun (or hibbatun) fi sha'ra (or hintafi shaira, 
‘wheat in barley’ etc.) is not as arbitrary as it may seem and the convoluted history behind shibboleth and hitta has received some 
attention in a recent work by the above-mentioned scholar (see U. Rubin, Between Bible and Qur’an: the Children of Israel and the 
Islamic Self-Image, Studies in Late Antiquity and Early Islam (17), Princeton: Darwin Press, 1999, ch. 4, 83-99). Ibn Manzur gives 
a useful synopsis of the meaning of hitta (see his Lisdn, s.v. ‘h-t-t’, ill, 224), while Fakhr al-Din al-Razi’s commentary on Q. 2:58-59 
provides an interesting analysis of the implications of this term for an understanding of the Qur’anic verse (Mafatih , II(i), 82ff). 
In any case, if the reader bears in mind the phonetic similarity between hittatun and habbatun, he or she should get a sense of the 
sort of play on words that the Muslim exegetical tradition understood from the Qur’anic reproach of the Israelites’ failure to fulfil 
their covenant.

the Red Sea ( bahr al-qulzum), and this was Eilat, [about] what befell its inhabitants, how they would 
transgress, violate, the Sabbath, by fishing, which they had been commanded not to do on that [day]; 
how (idh is an adverbial qualifier of y a'dim, ‘they [would] transgress’) their fish would come to them on 
the day of their Sabbath floating at the surface, visible at the surface of the water; but on the day they 
did not observe the Sabbath, when they would not consecrate the Sabbath over the other days, they 
would not come to them, as a trial from God. Thus were We trying them for their wickedness. And when 
they went to fish, the city ^>lit into three: one third joined the fishing party, another prohibited them, 
while a third abstained from both fishing and prohibiting.","Ask them [O Prophet] about the town which was by the sea and how they broke the Sabbath[63]. The fish would come to them appearing on the surface of the water on Sabbath days, but when it was not Sabbath, they would not come. This is how We tested them for their rebelliousness.",[63] This is another act of violation some of them committed.
7,164,166,"And when ( wa-idh is a supplement to the preceding idh, ‘how’) a community among them, who 
neither fished nor prohibited it, said, to those who prohibited it: ‘Why do you preach [admonition] to a 
folk whom God is about to destroy or chastise with a severe chastisement?’ They said, our admonishing 
[them] is, As an exculpation, by which we excuse ourselves, before your Lord, leht we are reproached for 
failing to prohibit [them] in any way; and so that they might be wary, of fishing’. And when they forgot, when they overlooked, that whereof they had been reminded, [that 
for which they had been] admonished, and did not desist, We delivered those who forbade evil, 
and seized those who did wrong, through transgression, with a grievous, terrible, chastisement for 
their wickedness. And when they disdained, to desist from, that which was prohibited to them, We said to them, 
‘Be apes, deSpised!’, abased, and they became so: this is an explication of what preceded [with regard 
to the details of their ‘grievous chastisement’]. Ibn ‘Abbas said, ‘I do not know what befell the group 
that abstained’. ‘Ikrima said, 17 ‘That group was not destroyed because they had been averse to what the 
others did and had said, ‘Why do you preach (admonition) ...’ Al-Hakim reported [in a hadith ] that he 
[‘Ikrima] referred this opinion to Ibn ‘Abbas, who was delighted by it. 18","When a group of them said, “Why are you admonishing a people whom Allah will destroy or punish severely?” They said, “To excuse ourselves before your Lord, and perhaps they may fear Allah.” . When they ignored the admonition they were given, We saved those who forbade evil and seized the wrongdoers with a grievous punishment for their defiant disobedience. . When they persistently violated what they were forbidden to do, We said to them, “Be despised apes[64].”","[64] Their deed was deceptive, only outwardly resembling observance of Allah’s commands. As such, Allah turned them into apes, only outwardly resembling humans, but were actually far apart from real humans."
7,167,171,"And when your Lord proclaimed, made it known, that He would send againSt them, that is, the 
Jews, to the Day of Resurrection, those who woidd inflict on them grievous torment, through humilia¬ 
tion and the exacting of the jizya-tax [from them]. Thus, God sent Solomon againSt them, and after him, 
Nebuchadnezzar, who slaughtered [some of] them and took [others among] them captive, and imposed 
the jizya-tax on them. They continued to pay this [tax] to the Magians up until the [time of the] sending 
of our Prophet (s), who [also] imposed it on them. Lol verily your Lord is swift in requital, of those who 
disobey Him. And lo! verily He is Forgiving, to those who obey Him, Merciful, [in dealing] with them. And We divided them. We separated them, into communities, secfts, in the earth. Some of them 
are righteous, and some of them, people [who], are otherwise, disbelievers and wicked individuals. 
And We tried them with good things, with graces, and evil things, with misfortunes, so that they might 
revert, from their wickedness. And there succeeded after them a generation who inherited the Scripture, the Torah, from their 
forefathers, choosing the transient things of this inferior [life], that is, the ephemeral as^eds of this 
lowly thing that the world is, in the way of what is lawful and what is unlawful, and saying, ‘It will be 

17 ‘Ikrima, Abu ‘Abd Allah al-Qurashl al-Barbari (d. 104/722), mawla Ibn ‘Abbas, was probably the moil famous transmitter of 
the ‘commentary’ of Ibn ‘Abbas represented in the traditional accounts. His trustworthiness was diluted in the biographical 
dictionaries and among commentators. See DhahabI, Siyar, v, 12-36; J. Schacht, s.v. “Ikrima, E12, m, 1081-82; Ibn Ilajar, Tahdhib, 
iv, 167-72. 

18 The details of this incident may be gleaned from Tabaris commentary on verse Q. 7:164 (in his /dm/' al-bayan, vi, i24ff., eSJ>. 
127). The story in itself is very interesting for what it reveals of the attitude of some of the Prophets Companions towards the 
religious duty of ‘enjoining decency and forbidding indecency’ (al-amr bi’l maruf wal-nahy ‘an al-munkar). ‘Ikrima, Ibn ‘Abbas’s 
famous mawla, visited his patron one day to find him distraught, after having read this verse, at the possibility that the ‘abstaining 
group’ might have suffered the same fate as ‘the transgressors of the Sabbath’. What concerned Ibn ‘Abbas was the relevance of the 
verse for his day: much like those who had abstained from prohibiting the transgression of the Sabbath, Ibn ‘Abbas — as he himself 
admits — together with many of his colleagues frequently refrained from prohibiting actions which they witnessed around them 
and considered as being clearly reprehensible. ‘Ikrima, however, was able to reassure him that the abstainers could not have been 
punished, since the verse points out that it was only when ‘they disdained [to refrain from] that which was prohibited to them, that 
those who transgressed were transformed into apes by way of punishment. The moral behind this tale, it seems, was that to abstain 
from committing indecency was possibly as valid a way of discouraging others from committing it as actively prohibiting it.

forgiven us’, what we have done; and yet if similar transient things were to come to them, they would 
take them ( wa-in ya’tihim ‘aradun mithluhu ya’khudhuhu: this sentence is a circumstantial qualifier), 
in other words, they hope for forgiveness whilst committing the same offence again and persisting in 
it: and in the Torah there is no [such] promise about forgiveness for persistence [in sin]. Has not the 
covenant of the Scripture (mithaqu l-kitabi, the annexation functions in place of fi, ‘in [sc. ‘the covenant 
in the Scripture’]) been taken ( a-lam yukhadh, ‘has [it] not been taken’, is an interrogative meant as an 
affirmative) from them that they should not say about God anything but the truth? And they have Stud¬ 
ied (wa-darasu , is a supplement to yukhadh, ‘has it [not] been taken?’), they have read, what is in it, so 
why do they impute lies to it [the Scripture] by ascribing to it [the idea of] forgiveness for persistence [in 
sin]? And the Abode of the Hereafter is better for those who are wary, of what is unlawful. Do they not 
understand? ( yaqilun, may also be read as taqilun, ‘[do] you [not] understand?’) that it is better and so 
prefer it to [the abode of] this world? And those who adhere (read yumassikun or yumsikun) to the Scripture, from among them, and 
have established prayer, the likes of ‘Abd Allah b. Salam and his companions, verily We shall not let the 
wages of reformers go to waSte (inna la nudiu ajra l-muslihin: the sentence is the predicate of alladhina, 
‘those who’; also there is here the replacing of the [third person] pronominalisation [alladhina, ‘those 
who’] with an overt noun [al-muslihina, reformers’], in other words, their wages). 19 And, mention, when We wrenched the mountain above them. We lifted it up [unearthing it] 
from its root, as if it were a canopy, and they thought, they were certain, that it was about to fall upon 
them, because of God’s threat to them that it would fall upon them if they refused to accept the rulings 
contained in the Torah, they had [initially] refused [to accept] them because of their being burdensome, 
but then accepted them, and We said to them: ‘Take firmly, seriously and earnestly, what We have given 
you, and remember what is in it, by adting in accordance with it, that you might be God-fearing’.","And [remember] when your Lord declared that He would send against them those who would afflict them with a terrible punishment[67] until the Day of Resurrection. Your Lord is Swift in Punishment, but He also is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. . We scattered them[68] through the land in communities – some of them were righteous and others were less so. We tested them with both prosperity and adversity, so that they would return [to Allah’s Obedience]. . They were then succeeded by other generations who inherited the Scripture, opting for the lowly gains[69], and saying, “We will be forgiven[70].” Yet if a similar gain[71] comes their way, they will seize it. Was not a covenant of the Scripture taken from them that they should not say about Allah except the truth, and they had studied its teachings? But the Home of the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah. Do you not understand? . As for those who hold fast to the Scripture and establish prayer, We will not let the reward of those who seek righteousness to be lost. . And [remember] when We raised the mountain over them as if it were a dark cloud, and they thought that it would fall upon them, “Hold fast to what We have given you[72] and observe its teachings, so that you may fear Allah.”","[67] This is for their constantly disparaging their pledge with Allah. . [68] This is an allusion to the Jewish Diaspora and their dispersion out of their lands. See 17:4-8. . [69] i.e., unlawful gains and pleasures.
 [70] It demonstrates how self-justifying they were in sticking to their devious ways.
 [71] i.e., a similar temptation. . [72] For their persistent rebellion and disobedience."
7,172,174,"And, remember, when your Lord took from the Children of Adam, from their loins (min 
zuhurihim, is an inclusive substitution for the preceding [clause: min bani Adama, ‘from the Children of 
Adam’], with the same preposition [min, ‘from’]) their seed, by bringing forth one from the loins of the 
other, [all] from the loins of Adam, offspring after offering, in the way that they multiply, [looking] like 
small ants at [the valley of] Na'man on the Day of‘Arafa [because of their multitude]. God set up proofs 
of His Lordship for them and endowed them with [the faculty of] reason, and made them testify againSt 
themselves, saying, ‘Am I not your Lord?’ They said, ‘Yea, indeed. You are our Lord, we testify’, to this, 
and this [taking of] testimony is, leSl they should say (in both instances, 20 read third person [yaqulu, 
‘they say’] or second person [taqulu, ‘you say’]) on the Day of Resurrection, ‘Truly, of this, Oneness of 
God, we were unaware’, not knowing it! Or leSt you should say, ‘It is merely that our fathers were idolaters before, that is, before our 
time, and we were descendants of theirs, and so we followed their example. Will You then destroy us, 
chaStise us, for that which those who follow falsehood did?’, from among our forefathers, by [their] 
establishing idolatry? The meaning is: they cannot use such arguments when they have been made to 
testify before their very selves to God’s Oneness. To effedt this reminder by the tongue of the bearer of the 
miracle [Muhammad (s)] equally serves [as a reminder] for every soul to remember this within itself. 21 Thus We detail the signs. We explain them even as We have explained the covenant, that they 
might refledt on them, and that they might revert, from their disbelief.","And [remember] when your Lord brought forth from the loins of the children of Adam their offspring and made them testify about themselves [asking], “Am I not your Lord?” They said, “Yes indeed; We testify[73].” [We did so] lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection, “We were unaware of this,” . Or that you say, “It was our forefathers before us who associated partners with Allah, and we are their offspring who came after them. Will you then destroy us for the falsehood that they invented?” . This is how We make the verses clear, so that they may return.",[73] This is alluding to the ‘mīthāq al-fitrah’ (the pledge of innate nature).

If We had willed, We could have elevated him thereby[75], but he clung to the [life of the] earth[76] and followed his desires. His likeness is that of a dog: if you attack it, it pants with its tongue lolling, and if you leave it, it still pants[77]. Such is the example of the people who reject Our revelations.

a variant reading has shirkan, meaning sharikan, ‘an associate’) in that which He had given them, by 
naming it ‘Abd al-Harith, ‘servant of al-Harith’, when it is not right to be a ‘servant’ (‘ abd ) of any one but 
‘God’ [sc. ‘Abd Allah], but this [namesake ‘Abd] is not an association [of another with God] in terms of 
servitude, for Adam was immune [from a sin such as associating others in worship with God]. 23 Samura 
[b. Jundub] 24 reported that the Prophet (s) said, ‘On one occasion when Eve gave birth — all the children 
she bore had failed to survive — Satan visited her and said [to her], “Name it [the child] ‘Abd al-Harith, 
and it will live.” She named it so and it lived. This [affair] was the result of Satan’s inspiration and his 
doings’: reported by al-Hakim, who deemed it [the report] ‘sound’ ( sahih ), and [also reported] by al- 

23 Muslim exegetes differ over the exact nature of Satan before his ‘fall’ and whether he was an angel or not. Some, like al-Hasan al- 
Basri, re ject the idea that he belonged with the angels, and argue that he must have been of the jinn. The majority, however, which 
included the likes of‘Abd Allah b. Mas'Qcl, Sa‘id b. al-Musayyab and the famous Ibn ‘Abbas, were of the opinion that Iblis had been 
the chief of the angels of the firfl heaven, the heaven of this world and that his name was ‘Azazil, or — as mentioned above — al- 
Harith (see Ibn Kathlr, Qisas, 17). According to a Prophetic hadlth, transmitted from the Companion Abu Dharr al-Ghifari, Adam 
is considered to have been the firS Messenger-Prophet ( nabi mursal, see Ibn Kathir, Qisas, 57) and for this reason Muslim tradition 
would — desjsite his disobedience regarding the Tree — accord him the ‘infallibility’ accorded to all the other prophets ( ismat al- 
anbiya’). The implication behind the Jalalayn gloss is that although (Adam and) Eve named their child ‘servant of al-Harith’, they 
did not intend thereby that worship could belong to any one other than God: Jalal al-DIn al-Suyuti is clearly trying to reconcile the 
elements of the qisas tradition with the concept of the ‘infallibility’ of the prophets. 

24 Samura b. Jundub (or Jundab) b. Hilal al-Fazari (d. 58 or 59/677-8), was one of the younger generation of Companions, highly 
regarded by the traditionisis of Basra, such as Ibn Sirin and al-Hasan al-Basri. Ziyad b. Abihi (d. 53/673), the governor of Iraq 
under Mu'awiya (r. 4t-6o/66i-68o), would leave Samura in charge of Basra when he was at Kufa and in charge of Kufa when 
the former was at Basra. Samura was remembered for his intolerant position towards the Kharijites of whom he killed a sizeable 
number. He died after falling into a cauldron of boiling water, which he had been using to treat his tetanus; see Dhahabi, Siyar, ill, 
183-6; Ibn al-Ahtlr, Usd, 11, 554f.; Ibn Hajar, Tahdhib, 11, 4326

Tafsir al-Jalalayn 

TirmidhI, who considered it ‘fair-uncommon ( hasan gharlb ); 25 but exalted is God above what they, the 
people of Mecca, associate, in the way of idols (this sentence is consequent, a supplement to [the one 
beginning with] khalaqakum, ‘He created you, so that what comes between the two is a parenthetical 
statement). Do they associate, with Him, in worship, those who cannot create anything, but are them¬ 
selves created, and who are not able to give them, that is, those who worship them, any help, nor can they help 
themselves?, by defending themselves against someone intending to damage them, by breaking them or 
otherwise (the interrogative is meant as a rebuke). And if you call them, that is, the idols, to guidance, they will not follow you (read yatba’ukum or 
yattabiukum). It will be the same [response] for you, whether you call them, to it, or whether you are 
silent, [refraining] from calling them, they will not follow it, because they cannot hear. Tridy those on whom you call, [whom] you worship, besides God are servants, owned, like 
you; call them then and let them answer you, your call, if you are truthful, in [claiming] that they are 
gods: God then illustrates their utter incapacity and the superiority which their worshippers possess over 
them, saying: Have they feet wherewith they walk or, indeed, have they hands (aydin is the plural of yad) 
wherewith they can gt adp or, indeed, have they eyes wherewith they can see or, indeed, have they ears 
wherewith they give ear? (an interrogative of rejection), in other words, they have none of these things, 
which you have, so why do you worship them when you are more complete in being than they are? Say, 
to them, O Muhammad (s): ‘Call upon your associates, to destroy me; then scheme against me, and 
watte no time, [do not] give me any respite, for I am not concerned with you.","It is He Who created you from a single soul, and from it He made its spouse[84], so that he may find comfort in her. When he covered her[85], she conceived a light burden carrying it with ease. Then when she grew heavy, they called upon Allah, their Lord, “If you give us a healthy child[86], we will certainly be grateful.” . But when He gave them a healthy child, they[87] ascribed partners to Him in that which He had given them. Exalted is Allah far above what they ascribe to Him. . Do they ascribe to Him partners who cannot create anything, but are themselves created? . They cannot help them, nor can they help themselves. . If you call them to guidance, they will not follow you; it is the same whether you call them or remain silent. . Those whom you supplicate besides Allah are slaves like you; supplicate them and let them respond to you, if you are truthful. . Do they have feet to walk with? Or hands to grasp with? Or eyes to see with? Or ears to hear with? Say [O Prophet], “Call your idols then conspire against me and give me no respite[88]!","[84] Adam and his mate, Eve.

and He takes charge of the righteous, by protecting them. And as for those on whom you call besides God, they have no power to help you, nor can they 
help themselves’, so why should I be concerned with them? And if you call upon them, that is, the idols, to guidance, they do not hear; and you see them, 
that is, the idols, O Muhammad (s), staring at you, looking toward you, as a person looks, but they do 
not perceive.","My Protector is Allah Who has sent down the Book, for it is He Who protects the righteous. .

the classification of hadtths. Such classifications are mostly accorded on the basis of the reliability of the transmitters involved. The 
category sahih, sound’, represents the highest grade of hadith, one in whose isnad, ‘chain of transmitters’, figure the highest grade 
of transmitters ( thiqa ). If a hadith contains one or more transmitters who are not considered as belonging to the thiqa, ‘reliable’, 
then a hadith will be classified according to a lower, but dill acceptable, category, such as hasan, ‘fair’. There are numerous other 
categories, some intermediate ones (such as hasan sahih), forming sub-categories, and culminating in the lowed grades of hadtths 
such as da'if, ‘weak’, munkar, ‘unacknowledged’, and even mawdu, ‘furious’ or ‘fabricated’; see Burton, Hadith, io6ff. 

26 This part of the verse is usually rendered as ‘keep to forgiveness’, or something to that effed. The gloss, however, indicates that 
’afw is being underdood as yusr, ‘ease’ or ‘freely’, in other words, what issues from people’s behaviour Spontaneously, and not in 
any premeditated way; this is reiterated by the remainder of the gloss that the Prophet should not probe into people’s adions or 
behaviour unnecessarily: it is by extension then that the Prophet should ad forgivingly, but this is not, technically Speaking, the 
exad sense of the verse. However, for want of a precise English equivalent, the rendition given above attempts to incorporate the 
two senses implicit in ‘afw, ‘freely’ and ‘forgiveness’.

it off from you, He is Hearing, of what is said, Seeing, of what is done. Truly the God-fearing, when a visitation front Satan touches them, befalls them ( tayfun: a vari¬ 
ant reading has taifun), that is, [when] something [of the sort] overcomes them, they remember, Gods 
punishment and His reward, and then see clearly, [distinguishing] the truth from what is other than it, 
and so they return [to God]. And their brothers, that is, the brothers of devils from among the disbelievers, they, the devils, 
lead them further into error, and, they, do not flop short, [do not] desiSt from it, by seeing clearly, in the 
way that those who are God-fearing come to see clearly. And when you do not bring them, that is, the people of Mecca, a sign, from among those which 
they request, they say, ‘Why have you not chosen one?’, [why have you not] produced one [all by] your¬ 
self? Say, to them: ‘I follow only that which is revealed to me from my Lord, and it is not for me to bring 
anything from myself; this, Qur’an, is insight, proofs, from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy for 
a people who believe’.","Be gracious, enjoin what is right and turn away from those who are ignorant[89]. . If you are tempted by Satan, seek refuge with Allah[90], for He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. . Those who fear Allah, when an evil whisper comes to them from Satan, they remember Him and immediately come back to their senses. . But the devils plunge their [human] brothers deeper into sin, sparing no effort. . When you do not bring them a sign[91], they say, “Why do you not improvise one?” Say, “I only follow what is revealed to me from my Lord. This [Qur’an] is an insight from your Lord, and a guidance and mercy for people who believe.”","[89] i.e., turn a blind eye and pretend to take no notice of their abuse. . [90] From flaring up out of rage or falling into sin. . [91] The Qur’an is the greatest sign ever, yet they denied it blindly."
7,204,206,"And when the Qur’an is recited, listen to it and pay heed, [refraining] from Speech, so that you 
might find mercy: this was revealed regarding [the requirement of] refraining from Speech during the 
[mosque] sermon, which here has been expressed by [the recital of] ‘the Qur’an’, because it [the sermon] 
comprises it; others say that it was revealed regarding the [requirement of silence and attention during 
the] recitation of the Qur’an in general. And remember your Lord within yourself, that is, secretly, humbly, submissively, and fearfully, 
in awe of Him, and, louder than [Sneaking] in secret, more quietly than speaking out loud, that is, a mid¬

be among the heedless, of God’s remembrance. Surely those who are with your Lord, namely, the angels, are not too proud, they do [not] dis¬

Medinese, except for verses 30 to 36 inclusive, which are Meccan; it consists of 75 or 77 verses, and was 
revealed after [surat] al-Baqara. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful: 

The Muslims fell into dilute over the ^oils of [the battle of] Badr. The young men said, ‘These [^oils] 
should be ours because we hastened to join the fighting’, while the old men said, ‘We were your support, 
holding up the banners behind you; had you been exposed, you would have come back to us, so do not 
claim it as yours exclusively.’ Thus the following was revealed:","When the Qur’an is recited, listen to it attentively and maintain silence, so that you may receive mercy. . And remember your Lord within yourself with humility and fear, without raising your voice, in the morning and evening, and do not be of those who are heedless. . Indeed, those [angels] who are near to your Lord do not disdain to worship Him; they glorify Him, and to Him they prostrate.",
8,1,4,"‘They question you, O Muhammad (s), concerning the spoils of war — the booty — to whom 
do they belong? Say, to them: ‘The spoils of war belong to God, Who places them where He will, and 
the Messenger, who divides them according to God’s command. The Prophet (s) divided these [spoils] 
between them equally, as reported by al-Hakim in his al-Muftadrak. So fear God and set things right 
between you, that is, [set right] the reality of that [state of affairs] which is between you, through mu¬ 
tual affeCtion and the refraining from quarrelling; and obey God and His Messenger, if you are, truly, 
believers’. The believers, those whose faith is complete, are only those who, when God is mentioned, that 
is, when His threat of punishment [is mentioned], their hearts tremble, fear, and when His verses are 
recited to them, they increase their faith, their acceptance of the truth, and who rely upon their Lord, 
[who] put their truff in Him [alone], and not in any other. Those who observe the prayers, performing them as they ought to be [performed], and who ex¬ 
pend, in obedience to God, from that with which We have provided them. Those, described in the way mentioned, are the true, the real, believers, without doubt. For them 
are ranks, stations in Paradise, with their Lord, and forgiveness, and generous provision, in Paradise.","They ask you [O Prophet] about the spoils of war[1]. Say, “The spoils of war belong to Allah and the Messenger. So fear Allah, settle your affairs among yourselves, and obey Allah and His Messenger, if you are [true] believers.” . The true believers are those whose hearts are filled with awe when Allah is mentioned, and their faith increases when His verses are recited to them, and they put their trust only in their Lord; . those who establish prayer and spend out of what We have provided for them. . Such are the true believers; they will have high ranks with their Lord, and forgiveness and honorable provision.",[1] Referring to the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) who asked him about the distribution of the of war booty.
8,5,8,"As your Lord brought you forth from your home with the truth ( bi’l-haqq is semantically con¬ 
nected to akhraja, ‘He brought forth’), and indeed a party of the believers were averse, to going forth 
(the [laff] sentence is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the [suffixed pronoun] kaf in akhrajaka, ‘He 
brought you forth’; kama, ‘as’, is the predicate of an omitted subject, in other words: their aversion to this 
State [of affairs of the booty being God’s and the Prophet’s] is similar to their aversion when you were 
brought forth [to fight], which had actually been better for them: likewise is this [State of affairs better for 
them]). It happened that Abu Sufyan was returning from Syria with a caravan. The Prophet (s) and his 
followers went forth to plunder it; but Quraysh became aware of this, and so Abu Jahl and some Meccan 
fighters rode out to defend it — these constituted the ‘band’. Abu Sufyan drove the caravan via the coaStal 
route and it managed to escape. Abu Jahl was then advised to return, but he refused and marched on 
towards Badr. The Prophet (s) consulted with his followers, saying to them, ‘God has promised me one 
of the two parties’. So they agreed with him to attack the [Meccan] band, but some of them were averse 
to this, complaining, ‘We have not come prepared for this!’, as God, exalted be He, says: They dispute with you concerning the truth, [the order] to fight, after it had become clear, [after it 
had] become evident to them, as though they were being driven to death while they looked, at it [death] 
with their very eyes, utterly averse to it. And, remember, when God promised you one of the two parties, either the caravan or the band 
[of Meccan fighters], that it should be yours, and you longed, you were wishing, that other than the 
armed one, that is, [other than] the fighting one with the weapons, in other words, [you longed that] the 
caravan, should be yours, because it had fewer men and less reinforcements than the band [of Mecca 
fighters]; but God willed that the truth be realised, [He willed] to manifest it, by His, preceding, words, 
that Islam should triumph; and to cut the root of the disbelievers, to the very laff man, by extirpating

them, and so He commanded you to fight against the band. And that He might cause the truth to be realised and annul, efface, falsehood, disbelief, however 
much the sinners, the idolaters, were averse, to that.","Just as your Lord brought you [O Prophet] out of your home for a just cause[2], even though a group of believers were averse to it. . They disputed with you concerning the truth[3] after it had become clear to them as if they were being driven towards death while they were looking on. . And [remember, O believers], when Allah promised you one of the two parties[4], that it would fall to you, and you wished that the unarmed one would fall to you. But it was Allah’s Will to establish the truth by His Words and exterminate the disbelievers, . so that He might establish the truth and nullify the falsehood, even though the wicked are averse to it.","[2] It is referring to the Battle of Badr. . [3] i.e., the imminent fighting. . [4] i.e., either the caravan of Quraysh or their army in the Battle of Badr."
8,9,14,"When you sought help from your Lord, asking Him to help you by granting you victory over them, 
and He answered you [saying]: ‘I shall reinforce you, I shall assist you, with a thousand angels, rank 
upon rank’, one rank following after the next: God promised them this [number] at firSt, but it then 
became three thousand, and then five thousand, as stated in [surat] Al ‘Imran [Q. 3:124-125] (a variant 
reading [of alf ‘thousand’] has the plural aluf ‘thousands’, 1 similar [in pattern] to aflus, coins’). And God appointed it, that is, the reinforcement, only as good tidings, and that your hearts might 
thereby be reassured. Victory comes only from God: surely God is Mighty, Wise. Remember, when He caused slumber to overcome you as security, againSt the fear that had be¬ 
fallen you, from Him, from God, and sent down upon you water from the heaven, to purify you thereby, 
from minor and major ritual impurities; and to remove from you the evil of Satan, his whimperings to 
you that, had you been on the right path, you would not have been thirsty and impure, while the idolaters 
enjoyed [access to] water; and to Strengthen, to seal, your hearts, with certainty and endurance; and to 
make firm your feet, left: they sink in the sand. When your Lord inspired the angels, with whom He reinforced the Muslims, [saying]: ‘I am with 
you, with assistance and victorious help, so make the believers Stand firm, by helping [them] and giving 
[them] good tidings. I shall caSt terror, fear, into the hearts of the disbelievers; so smite above the necks, 
that is, the heads, and smite of them every finger!’, that is, [smite] the extremities of their hands and feet: 
thus, when one of them went to Strike an disbeliever’s head, it would roll off before his sword reached it. 
The Prophet (s) threw a handful of pebbles againSt them and every single idolater was Struck in his eye, 
and thus they were defeated. That, chastisement befalling them is, because they had contended with, they had opposed, God 
and His Messenger: whoever contends with God and with His Messenger, surely God is severe in retri¬ 
bution, againSt him. That, chastisement, is for you, so taSte it, O disbelievers, in this world; and [know] that for the 
disbelievers, in the Hereafter, is the chastisement of the Fire.","[Remember] when you were seeking the help of your Lord [at Badr] and He responded to you, “I will reinforce you with a thousand angels[5], following one another in succession.” . Allah granted this only as glad tidings and to reassure your hearts, for victory only comes from Allah. Indeed, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. . [Remember] when He caused drowsiness to overcome you as an assurance from Him, and He sent down rain from the sky to purify you and to remove Satan’s whispers from you, and to strengthen your hearts and to steady your footsteps. . [Remember] when your Lord inspired the angels, “I am with you[6], so make firm the feet of those who believe. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. So strike their necks and strike all their limbs[7].” . That is because they opposed Allah and His Messenger. Whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger, Allah is indeed severe in punishment. . That is for you, so taste it, and for the disbelievers, there will be the punishment of the Fire.","[5] The number of Quraysh army was 1000 fighters. Allah bolstered Muslims with 1000 angels, who only numbered 319 men beforehand. . [6] Allah’s ‘special withness’ (ma‘iyyah khāssah) is by His support and aid.
 [7] i.e., ""all extremities,"": their hands and feet."
8,15,16,"O you who believe, when you encounter the disbelievers inching forward, that is, amassed, ad¬ 
vancing slowly because of their large numbers, 2 do not turn your backs to them, fleeing. Whoever turns his back to them on that day, the day of the encounter with them, unless manoeu¬ 
vring, turning around, for battle — by pretending to be in flight, as a trick, while actually intending to 
relaunch an attack — or joining another detachment, a company of Muslims, calling on it for assistance,

disbelievers, and that He might try the believers with a fair teSt, a [fair] gift, namely, booty; surely God 
is Hearing, of their sayings, Knowing, of their conditions.

2 The Arabic verb z-h-/literally means ‘to crawl’ as would a child before walking: the image is that of a large troop which, from a 
distance, seems to be crawling because of its slow pace of advance.

Tafsir al-Jalalayn That is, the true gift, for you, and [know] that God weakens the plan of the disbelievers. If you have sought a judgement, O disbelievers, if you have sought a decisive conclusion [of this 
battle] — Abu Jahl had said, ‘O God! Whoever among [the two of] us is the one who has severed the 
ties of kinship and brought us what we had never known, destroy them today!’ — the judgement, the 
decisive conclusion, has now come to you, by the facft that the one so described has [already] perished: 
this was Abu Jahl and those killed with him, and not the Prophet (s) and the believers; and if you desiSl, 
from unbelief and waging war, it will better for you. But if you return, to fight against the Prophet ( 5 ), 
We shall return, to assist him against you, and your hoSt, your troops, will not avail, will not prated, you 
in any way, however numerous it be; and verily God is with the believers (read thus inna, indicating a 
new sentence; or read anna, with an implicit lam [li-anna‘Llaha ma c a’l-muminin, ‘because God is with 
the believers’]).","It was not you who killed them, but it was Allah Who killed them; and it was not you [O Prophet] who threw when you threw [a handful of sand][8] but it was Allah Who threw, so that He might test the believers with a great test. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. . As such, Allah undermines the plans of the disbelievers. . If you [disbelievers] were seeking the decision, it has come to you[9]. If you desist, it will be better for you, but if you return [to war], We too will return. And your forces – no matter how great in number they are – will not avail you anything, for Allah is with the believers.","[8] It filled their eyes and noses, preventing their advance. . [9] The disbelievers implored Allah against Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) and Muslims (alleging that they were wrongdoers), so His decision came."

ing His command, while you are listening, to the Qur’an and the admonitions. And do not be as those who say, ‘We hear,’ and they hear not, in such a way as to reflecft and heed 
admonition — these are either the hypocrites or the idolaters. Surely the worst of beasts in God’s sight are those who are deaf, to hearing the truth, and dumb, 
[unable] to utter it, those who do not understand. For had God known of any good in them, any righteousness, were they to listen to the truth, He 
would have made them hear, in such a way as to understand; and had He made them hear — hypotheti¬ 
cally Sneaking — already knowing that there is no good in them, they would have turned away, from it, 
averse, to accepting it, out of obstinacy and in denial. Oyou who believe, respond to God and the Messenger, with obedience, when He calls you to that 
which will give you life, in the matter of religion, for it will be the source of everlasting life [for you]; and

His will; and that it is to Him that you shall be gathered, and He will requite you for your deeds. And be afraid of a trial which, if it were to fall upon you, would certainly not fall exclusively upon

3 Abu Lubaba Rifa'a (or Bashir, or Rafi‘) b. ‘Abd al-Mundhir al-Ansari (d. between 36/656 and 4t/66i). Despite uncertainty over 
his firCt name, ‘Marwan’ is not one of the names given by the prosopographical dictionaries as possible alternatives; however, his 
patronymic, Abu Lubaba, is said to be the title mostly used to identify him. His repentance — mentioned in the commentary two 
verses later — for distorting the Prophet’s message to the Banu Qurayza is also recorded in the entries on him; the confusion over 
his name is evident in Ibn al-Athir, see Usd, 1, 399b (sub ‘Bashir’), 11, 283-86 (sub ‘Rifa‘a’), and vi, 260-62 (sub ‘Abu Lubaba’); Ibn 
Hajar, however, is aware of the first name ‘Marwan’, because, as he says, he has seen it in Zamakhshari’s commentary (Kashshaf, n, 
153) on the said verse of surat al-Anfal: see Tahdhlb, vi, 443 (sub ‘Abu Lubaba’). He died during the caliphate of‘Ali b. Abi Talib.

cerns of the Hereafter; and that with God is a tremendous wage, so do not forfeit it by giving [undue] 
attention to wealth and children, aching treacherously for the sake of [preserving] them. The following was revealed regarding his [AbuLubabas] repentance: O you who believe, if you fear 
God, by turning [in repentance] to Him and in other ways, He will grant you a [means of] separation, 4 
between yourselves and what you fear, so that you will be delivered, and absolve you of your evil deeds, 
and forgive you, your sins; and God is of tremendous bounty.","O you who believe, do not betray Allah and the Messenger, nor betray your trusts knowingly. . Know that your wealth and your children[16] are only a trial and that with Allah is an immense reward. . O you who believe, if you fear Allah, He will provide you with an insight[17] to distinguish between right and wrong, absolve you of your sins and forgive you, for Allah is the Lord of great bounty.","[16] Due to your love for both of them, you may violate Allah’s commands concerning them. . [17] Or a way out of difficulties."
8,30,37,"And, remember, O Muhammad (s), when the disbelievers — who had gathered to discuss your 
affair at the council assembly 5 — were plotting against you, to confine you, to chain you up and imprison 
you, or slay you — all of them [ading as] assassins of one man — or to expel you, from Mecca, and they 
were plotting, againd you, and God was plotting, againd them, by devising a way [out] for you, when 
He revealed to you what they had devised and commanded you to leave [Mecca]; and God is the be it of 
those who plot, the mod knowledgeable among them about it. And when Our verses, namely, the Qur’an, were being recited to them, they said, ‘We have al¬ 
ready heard! If we wish we can Speak the like of this — al-Nadr b. al-Harith 6 said this, for he used to 
travel on trading business to al-Hira, where he would buy books containing the tales of the Persians, and 
would recount these to the Meccans; this, Qur’an, is nothing but the fables, the lies, of the ancients’. And when they said, ‘O God! If this, that Muhammad (s) recites, be indeed the truth, revealed, 
from You, then rain down Clones upon us from the heaven, or bring on us a painful chastisement’, in 
return for [our] denial of it: this was said by al-Nadr and others, in mockery and in delusion that he had 
some insight and certainty about it [the Qur’an] being false. God then says: But God was not about to chaStise them, for what they requeded, while you were 
among them, for when chadisement is sent down it is all-encompassing, and no community was ever 
chadised except after its prophet and the believers had departed from it; nor was God about to chaStise 
them while they sought forgiveness, crying, as they performed the circumambulations: ‘Your forgive¬ 
ness! Your forgiveness!’; it is also said that this [lad clause] refers to those oppressed believers among 
them, similar to where God says Had they been clearly separated, verily We would have chastised the dis¬ 
believers among them with a painful chastisement [Q. 48:25]. But what [plea] have they now, that God should not chaStise them, with the sword, after your 
departure and that of the oppressed [believers] — if this [verse] is underdood in accordance with the 
fird opinion [that it refers to the idolaters asking forgiveness], then it abrogates the previous one, for God 
had chadised them at Badr and in other indances — when they bar, prevent the Prophet (s) and the 
Muslims,/rom the Sacred Mosque, [from] performing circumambulations there, though they are not its 
guardians?, as they claim? Its only [rightful] guardians are the God-fearing, but moSt of them do not 
know, that they have no [rightful] cudodianship over it. And their prayer at the [Sacred] House is nothing but whistling and hand-clapping: in other 
words they do this in place of the prayer which they were ordered to perform — therefore taSte now, at 
Badr, the chastisement for your unbelief! T he disbelievers expend their wealth, in waging war againd the Prophet (s), in order to bar from 

4 The term furqan occurs elsewhere as an epithet for the Qur’an, the ‘Criterion’ by which believers are able to discriminate between 
‘good’ and ‘evil’; here, however, the Jalalayn gloss suggests that it is being understood more as a (protective) ‘separation’ between 
those who are fearful and that which they fear, in other words, as an alternative infinitive offaraqa: farqan, furqanan. 

5 Shortly before the Emigration to Medina, while the Prophet was Still in Mecca, a meeting took place in which the leaders of 
Quraysh agreed to Abu Jahl’s plan to do away with the Prophet: a band of young men, drawn from all the clans, would assassinate 
the Prophet, each Striking him a blow so that his blood would fall upon all of them; Banu Hashim, the Prophet’s clan — short of 
fighting the entire tribe — would thus be forced into accepting blood-money for their slain kinsman. 

6 Al-Nadr b. al-Harith b. Kalada b. ‘Alqama al-Qurashi was one of the bitterest enemies of the Prophet; he was known for claiming 
that his Stories about things Persian could rival those of the Qur’an. In an exception to his lenient policy towards those captured in 
battle, and given al-Nadr’s marked hostility towards him, the Prophet ordered ‘All b. Abi Talib to kill al-Nadr in the aftermath of 
the battle of Badr; see Ibn al-Athlr, Usd , v, 30if.

God’s way, and they will expend it until, in the end, it will be a source of anguish for them, a regret, for 
having loht it and lost what they had intended [by expending it]; then they will be defeated, in this world, 
and the disbelievers, among them, will be gathered, driven, into Hell, in the Hereafter, that God may distinguish (read li-yamiza, or li-yumayyiza, is semantically connected to takunu, 
‘it will be’ [from the previous verse]) the wicked, the disbeliever,/rom the good, the believer, and place 
the wicked one upon another, and heap them up all together and put them in Hell: those, they are 
the losers.","And [remember] when the disbelievers plotted against you[18], to take you as captive, kill you or expel you. They plan, and Allah also plans, but Allah is the Best of those who plan. . When Our verses are recited to them, they say, “We have heard. If we wished, we could say something like this. This is nothing but ancient fables.” . And [remember] when they said, “O Allah, if this is indeed the truth from You, then rain down upon us stones from the heaven or bring upon us a painful punishment[19].” . But Allah would not punish them while you [O Prophet] are among them, nor would Allah punish them as long as they seek forgiveness. . Why should Allah not punish them when they prevent [people] from the Sacred Mosque, although they are not its rightful guardians? Its rightful guardians are only those who fear Allah, but most of them do not know. . Their prayer at the Sacred House was nothing but whistling and clapping. So taste the punishment[20] for your disbelief. . The disbelievers spend their wealth to prevent [people] from the way of Allah. They will continue to spend it, then it will be a source of regret for them, then they will be defeated, and those who disbelieve will be gathered into Hell, . so that Allah may separate the wicked from the good, and pile up the wicked all together and then cast them into Hell. It is they who are the losers.","[18] They plotted against the Messenger (ﷺ) in Makkah. . [19] Abu Jahl and other disbelievers invoked this supplication. .

belief and from waging war against the Prophet (s), that which ispaSt, of their deeds, will be forgiven 
them; but if they return, to waging war against him, the way of [dealing with] the ancients has al¬ 
ready gone before!, that is. Our way [in dealing] with them, by destroying them: We will do the same 
with these ones. And fight them until sedition, idolatry, is, exists, no more and religion is all for God, alone, none 
other being worshipped; then if they desiSt, from unbelief, surely God sees what they do, and will requite 
them for it. But if they turn away, from belief, know that God is your Protestor, your Helper and the One Who 
takes charge of your affairs — an excellent Protestor, is He, and an excellent Helper!, [He is] for you.","Say to those who disbelieve that if they desist[21], their past will be forgiven, but if they persist, then they have a precedent in those who have passed before them. . Fight them until there is no more persecution[22] and the religion is entirely for Allah; but if they desist, then Allah is All-Seeing of what they do. . But if they turn away, then know that Allah is your Protector. What an excellent Protector and an excellent Helper!","[21] From disbelief and disobedience. .

the fifth of it is for God, to have it dispensed as He will, and for the Messenger and for the kinsmen, the

dina (read ‘udwa or ‘idwa, meaning ‘the side of a valley’), and they were on the yonder bank, the one 
further from it, and the cavalcade, the caravan, was, in a place, below you, the coaStal side; and had you, 
and the [enemy] band, agreed to meet, for battle, you would have surely failed to keep meeting; but. He 
brought you together at a different time, that God might conclude a matter that was to be done, through 
His knowledge — namely, the victory of Islam and the obliteration of unbelief — He did this so, that 
he who perished might perish, might be a disbeliever [even], after a clear proof, that is, after a manifest 
proof has been established againSt him, namely, the triumph of the believers, deSJfite their small number, 
over the larger [enemy] army; and that he who survived might live, might believe, after a clear proof; 
surely God is Hearing, Knowing. Remember, when God showed them to you in your dream, in your sleep, as few, and so you in¬ 
formed your companions of this, and they were delighted, and had He shown them to you as many, you 
would have faltered, shrunk in cowardice, and quarrelled, fallen into disagreement, over the matter, 
the matter of fighting; but God saved, you, from faltering and quarrelling. He knows that which is in the 
breasts, that which is in the hearts. And when God made you see them, O believers, when you met — in your eyes as few, as 70 or 
100, when they were [in facft] 1000, so that you would advance againSt them; and He made you seem as 
few in their eyes, so that they would advance and not turn back from fighting you — this was before close 
combat had begun, but when it began, He made them [the disbelievers] see these [believers] as twice

be done; and to God all things are returned, reverting.","[Remember] when you were on the near side of the valley [of Badr], and they were on the far side, and the caravan was on the lower ground beneath you. If you had made prior arrangements to encounter, you would have failed to keep that appointment. But [it happened] so that Allah might accomplish what had already been decreed, and so that those who chose to perish would perish after seeing clear evidence, and those who chose to survive would survive after seeing clear evidence. Indeed, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. . [Remember] when Allah showed them to you in your dream as few in number; if He had shown them to you as many, you [believers] would have lost courage and disputed in the matter. But Allah spared you [of that], for He is All-Knowing of what is in the hearts. . And [remember] when you met, He made them appear as few in your eyes, and made you appear as few in their eyes, so that Allah may accomplish what was already decreed.

and be patient. Surely God is with the patient, giving them vicftory and assistance. And do not be like those who went forth from their dwellings, to defend their caravan and but 
did not return after it had passed safely, in recklessness and to show off to men — when they said, ‘We 
will not return until we have drunk wine, sacrificed the camels, and have been entertained by singers

encompasses, in knowledge, what they do (yamaluna, also read ta’maluna, ‘you do’), and will requite

meet the Muslims, when they had feared to set out on account of their enemy, the Banu Bakr, 7 and said, 
to them: ‘Today no person shall overcome you, for I shall be your protestor’, from among the [Banu] 
Kinana — he appeared to them in the form of Suraqa b. Malik, 8 the chieftain of that region. But when 
the two armies, the Muslims and the disbelievers, sighted each other, [when] they met and he [Satan] 
saw the angels, his hand clawing that of al-Harith b. Hisham, 9 he turned his back, he withdrew, inflight, 
saying — when they had said to him, ‘Are you abandoning us in such a predicament?’, 7 am quit of you, 
of being your protecftor, for I see what you do not see, in the way of angels. I fear God, leSt He destroy 
me; and God is severe in retribution’. When the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a sickness, a weakness of faith, said, ‘Their 
religion has deluded them’, that is, the Muslims, for they had set out to fight a large army despite their 
small number, in the mistaken belief that they will be victorious because of this. God, exalted be He, says 
in re^onse to them: but whoever relies on God, [whoever] puts his trust in Him, he will triumph; for 
truly God is Mighty, His way will prevail. Wise, in His actions.","O you who believe, when you encounter a group [in battle], stand firm and remember Allah much, so that you may triumph[27]. .

Do not be like those[28] who came out of their homes insolently, showing off to people, and preventing others from Allah’s way, for Allah is All-Encompassing of what they do. . And [remember] when Satan made their misdeeds appealing to them, and said, “No one can overcome you today, and I am your protector.” But when the two armies faced each other, he turned on his heels and said, “I have nothing to do with you, for I see what you do not see. I surely fear Allah, for Allah is severe in punishment.” . And [remember] when the hypocrites and those who have sickness in their hearts said, “These [believers] are deluded by their religion.” But whoever puts his trust in Allah[29], Allah is indeed All-Mighty, All-Wise.",[27] How to win a victory: 1.

8,50,51,"And if you could only see, O Muhammad (s), when the angels take (read either as yatawaffa or 
tatawaffa) the disbelievers, beating (yadribuna is a circumstantial qualifier) their faces and their backs, 
with hooked iron rods, and, they say to them: ‘Tafte the chaftisement of burning, that is, the Fire (the 
response to the [clause beginning with] law, ‘if’, would be la-ra’ayta amran ‘aziman, ‘you would truly

God is never unjuft to His servants’, such that he would punish them for no sin. 

7 The Banu Bakr b. ‘Abd Manat, a sub-tribe of the larger Banu Kinana, were known enemies of Quraysh, for these latter had suc¬ 
cessfully expelled them from Mecca when Quraysh captured the city from its former mailers, Khuza'a. There was an outstanding 
blood-feud between the two at the time of the battle of Badr, and Quraysh were hesitant about advancing against the Muslim army 
for fear that the Banu Bakr might exploit the opportunity to attack them, thus creating two battle-fronts for them. Quraysh, how¬ 
ever, received assurances from a leading KinanI, Suraqa b. Malik (see next note, below) and the two tribes enjoyed closer relations 
thereafter; see W. Montgomery. Watt, Muhammad at Medina, Oxford: OUP, 1956, ch. iv, 83. 

8 Suraqa, Abu Sufyan, b. Malik b. Ju'shum b. Mudlij al-Kinani (d. ca. 24/644) famously pursued the Prophet and Abu Bakr as they 
fled alone towards Medina. He would later become a receded Companion; see Ibn al-Athir, Usd, 11, 412-14; Ibn Hajar, Tahdhib, 
11, 267ft 

9 Al-Harith b. Hisham b. al-Mughlra al-Qurashi al-Makhzuml, brother of Abu Jahl and paternal cousin of the famous Khalid b. 
al-Walld, was one of the disbelievers at Badr. He was subsumed by the general amnesty declared by the Prophet upon his conquest 
of Mecca and later became a Muslim. He died somewhere in Syria during the caliphate of‘Umar b. al-Khattab, either as a martyr 
in the battle of al-Yarmuk (15/637), or, having survived the battle, as a victim of the notorious plague of ‘Amwas (Emrnaus) in the 
year 17/638; see Ibn al-Athir, Usd, 1, 643-45.

8,52,54,"The way of these people is, like the way of Pharaoh’s folk and those before them: they disbelieved 
in God’s signs and so God seized them, with chastisement, because of their sins (the sentence beginning 
with kafaru, ‘they disbelieved’, explains the previous one). Truly, God is Strong, in what He wills, severe 
in retribution. That, chastisement of the disbelievers, is because God would never change a grace that He had 
conferred on a people, substituting it with affliction, until they have changed that which is in them¬ 
selves, [until] they have exchanged the grace conferred upon them for unbelief, in the way that the 
Meccan disbelievers exchanged their being ‘fed againSt hunger’, their being made ‘safe from fear’ [cf. Q. 
106:4] and the sending of the Prophet (s) to them, for unbelief, [for] barring againSt the way of God and 
[for] fighting Muslims; and [know] that God is Hearing, Knowing. Like the way of Pharaoh’s folk and those before them: they denied the signs of their Lord, so We 
destroyed them for their sins, and We drowned the folk of Pharaoh, his people together with him, and

They disbelieved in the signs of Allah, so Allah seized them for their sins. Indeed, Allah is All-Powerful and Severe in Punishment. . This is because Allah would never change the blessings He has bestowed upon a people until they change their own attitude and conduct. Indeed, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. . Their case is like the people of Pharaoh and those who came before them. They rejected the signs of their Lord, so We destroyed them[31] for their sins and drowned the people of Pharaoh; they were all wrongdoers.","[30] The people of ‘Ād, Thamūd and others met the same fate. .

God is with the Steadfast, by His support [of them].","But if they intend to deceive you, then Allah is sufficient for you; it is He Who supported you with His help and with that of the believers. . He brought their hearts together[39], even if you had spent all that is on earth, you could not have brought their hearts together, but Allah has brought them together, for He is All-Mighty, All-Wise. . O Prophet, Allah is sufficient for you[40] and for the believers who follow you. . O Prophet, urge the believers to fight. If there are twenty steadfast among you, they will overcome two hundred; and if there are a hundred of you, they will overcome a thousand of the disbelievers, for they are a people who do not understand. . Now Allah has lightened your burden, for He knew that there is weakness in you. So if there are a hundred steadfast men among you, they will overcome two hundred; and if there are a thousand, they will overcome two thousand, by Allah’s permission. And Allah is with those who are steadfast.","[39] The joining of the hearts was indeed a great favour, as the extent of enmity among them in the pre-Islamic era was rampant. . [40] See 3:173."
8,67,71,"The following was revealed when they ransomed those taken captive at Badr: It is not for any 
Prophet to have (read as an takuna lahu or an yakuna lahu ) prisoners until he has made slaughter in 
the land, going all the way in fighting disbelievers. You, O believers, desire the transient things of this 
world, its ephemeral gains, by ransoming, while God desires, for you, the Hereafter, that is, its reward, 
through your killing them; and God is Mighty, Wise: this was abrogated by His words [and set them free] 
afterward either with grace or by ransom [Q. 47:4]. Had it not been for an ordinance from God which had preceded, making Spoils and the taking of 
captives lawful for you, an awful chastisement would have affiided you for what you took, as ransom. Now eat of what you have plundered, as lawful and good, and fear God. Truly God is For¬ 
giving, Merciful. O Prophet, say to those captives who are in your hands: (asm, may also be read as asara) ‘If God 
knows of any good, any faith or sincere devotion, in your hearts He will give you better than that which 
has been taken from you, by way of ransom, by His multiplying it for you in this world and rewarding 

10 Mujahid b. Jabr al-Makkl (d. 104/722), mawla of al-Sa’ib al-Makhzumi, was an important disciple of the commentary school of 
Ibn ‘Abbas, but he also narrated exegetical material from ‘All b. Abl Talib and Ubayy b. Ka‘b. He famously took part in the failed 
anti-Umayyad revolt of Ibn al-Ash‘ath in the year 82/701 and was subsequently imprisoned by the tyrannical al-Hajjaj for his in¬ 
volvement in the rebellion. His ‘Successor’ generation, which included the likes of Sa‘id b. Jubayr (d. 95/713) — who was actually 
executed by al-Hajjaj for his part in the rebellion — ‘Ata’ b. Abi Rabah (d.114/732) and ‘Amr b. Dinar (d. 126/743), was formative 
for the burgeoning field of Muslim tafsir. Mujahid’s exegetical opinions are cited in almost all the classical Sunni commentaries, 
especially that of al-Tabari. On Mujahid, see Dhahabi, Mufassiriin, 1, 107 and Siyar, iv, 449-57; Ibn Hajar, Tahdhib, v, 373-75; A.

Badr, through slaying and capture, so let them anticipate the like if they return [to betrayal]; and God is 
Knower, of His creatures. Wise, in His actions.","It is not befitting for a prophet to take captives[41] until he thoroughly subdues [the enemy] in the land. You desire the gains of this world[42], but Allah desires [for you] the Hereafter. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. . Were it not for a prior decree[43] from Allah, you would have surely been afflicted with a great punishment for what you have taken [of ransom]. . So consume what you have gained in war, for it is lawful[44] and good, but fear Allah. Allah is indeed All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. . O Prophet, tell those captives who are in your custody, “If Allah knows of any good[45] in your hearts, He will give you something better than what has been taken from you, and will forgive you, for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” . But if they intend to betray you, they have already betrayed Allah before, so He empowered you over them.

walaya ) with them, and so there is no inheriting between you and them and no share of the spoils for 
them, until they emigrate, this was abrogated by the end of this sura; but if they ask you for assistance 
in the matter of religion then it is your duty to assist, them against the disbelievers, except againSl a folk 
between whom and you there is a covenant, a pad: in which case, do not assist them against these others 
and so break your pad; and God sees what you do. And those who disbelieve are allies of one another, in terms of [mutual] support and inheritance, 
and so there is no inheriting between you and them. Unless you do this, [unless] you ally yourselves with 
the believers and sever relations with the disbelievers, there will be sedition in the land and great cor¬ 
ruption, with disbelief gaining power and Islam becoming weak. And those who believed and emigrated and Strove for the way of God, and those who provided 
refuge and assisted — those are the true believers, and for them is forgiveness and a generous provi¬ 
sion, in Paradise. And those who believed afterwards, that is, after the firs't believers and emigrants, and emigrated 
and Strove with you — they are of you, O Muhajirun and Ansar; and those related by blood, kinsmen,

The basmala, ‘In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful’, does not preface this [sura] because 
the Prophet (s) was not commanded to [recite] it [in this way], as may be understood from a hadlth re¬ 
ported by al-Hakim, in which he States [by way of an isnad] from ‘All that the basmala is [invoked] for 
‘security’ ( aman ), whereas this [sura] was revealed to remove security by way of the sword. According 
to [a hadlth related] by Hudhayfa [b. al-Yaman]: ‘You call it the sura of Repentance, but it is actually the 
sura of Chastisement ( al- c adhab )’. Al-Bukhari reported [by way of an isnad] from al-Bara’ [b. ‘Azib] that 
this was the laSt sura to be revealed.","Those who believed, migrated, and fought with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah, and those who provided [the migrants] with shelter and help – they are allies of one another. As for those who believed but did not migrate, you have no obligation to protect them until they migrate. But if they seek your help in religion, it is your obligation to help, except against people with whom you have a treaty. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do. . Those who disbelieve are protectors of one another[46]. Unless you do likewise, there will be persecution in the land and great corruption. . Those who believed, migrated and fought in the cause of Allah, as well as those who gave them refuge and help – it is they who are the true believers; they will have forgiveness and an honorable provision. . And those who believed afterwards, migrated and fought along with you – they belong to you. But blood relatives are more entitled to inherit[47] from one another according to the Book of Allah. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of everything.","[46] i.e., taking one another as allies and abandoning all bonds with the disbelievers. .

month of] Shawwal, on the basis of what will come shortly — after which there will be no security for 
you, and know that you cannot escape God, that is, you shall [not] elude His punishment, and that God 
degrades the disbelievers’, humiliating them in this world by having them killed, and in the Hereafter, 
by [sending them to] the Fire. A proclamation, a notification, from God and His Messenger to mankind on the day of the Greater 
Pilgrimage, the Day of Sacrifice ( yawm al-nahr ), that God is free from obligation to the idolaters, and 
their pacfts, and [so is] His Messenger, also free from obligation: in that same year, year 9 [of the Hijra], 
the Prophet (s) sent forth ‘All, who proclaimed these verses on the Day of Sacrifice at Mina, and also [he 
proclaimed] that after this year no idolater will [be allowed to] make pilgrimage or circumambulate the 
House naked, as reported by al-Bukharl. So, if you repent, of unbelief, it will be better for you; but if you 
turn away, from belief, then know that you cannot escape God. And give tidings to — inform — those 
who disbelieve of a painful chastisement, namely, [of] slaughter or capture in this world, and of [punish¬

anyone, from among the disbelievers, againSt you; [as for these] fulfil your pad with them until, the 
completion of, the term, to which you have agreed. Truly God loves those who fear [Him], by fulfilling 
pads. Then, when the sacred months have passed — that is, [at] the end of the period of deferment — 
slay the idolaters wherever you find them, be it during a lawful [period] or a sacred [one], and take 
them, captive, and confine them, to cattles and forts, until they have no choice except [being put to] 
death or [acceptance of] Islam; and lie in wait for them at everyplace of ambush, [at every] route that 
they use ( kulla, every’, is in the accusative because a [preceding] genitive-taking preposition has been 
removed). 2 But if they repent, of unbelief, and establish prayer and pay the alms, then leave their way 
free, and do not interfere with them. God is Forgiving, Merciful, to those who repent. And if any one of the idolaters (ahadun, ‘one’, is in the nominative because of the [following] verb 
[iSlajaraka, ‘seeks your protedion] that validates it) seeks your protedion, requests security from you 
against being killed, then grant him protedion, provide security for him, so that he might hear the words

A declaration from Allah and His Messenger to the people on the day of the greater pilgrimage[3], that Allah and His Messenger are free from obligation to the polytheists.

9,7,11,"How can the idolaters have a pad with God and His Messenger — they cannot —while they dis¬ 
believe in God and His Messenger, acting treacherously; except for those with whom you made a pad at 
the Sacred Mosque?, the day of al-Hudaybiyya — these were Quraysh, for whom an exception was made 
earlier [Q. 9:4]. So long as they are true to you, keeping to the pad and not breaking it, be true to them, 
by fulfilling it (fa-ma, ‘so long as’: the md is a conditional particle). Truly God loves the God-fearing: the 
Prophet (s) had kept to the pad made with them until they broke it by supporting the Banu Bakr againd 
Khuza'a. How, can they have a pad, when, if they get the better of you, [if] they have the upper hand over 
you, they do not reaped, [they do not] take into consideration, any bond, kinship, or treaty, pad, with 
regard to you, but will indead harm you as much as they can (the conditional sentence [‘if they ...’] is 
[also] a circumdantial qualifier), pleasing you with their tongues, with charming words, while their 
hearts refuse, to be true to these [words]; and mod of them are wicked, violators of pads. They have purchased with the signs of God, the Qur’an, a small price, of this world, that is, they 
have refrained from following them in favour of passions and whims, and have barred [people] from 
His way. His religion. Truly evil is that, deed of theirs, which they are wont to do. They reaped neither bond [of kinship] nor treaty with regard to a believer; those, they are 
the transgressors. Yet if they repent and edablish prayer and pay the alms, then they are your brothers in religion; 
and We detail. We explain, the signs for a people who know, [who] refled.","How can the polytheists have a treaty with Allah and with His Messenger, except those whom you made a treaty with at the Sacred Mosque[10]?

How [can there be a treaty] – if they were to overcome you, they would neither respect ties of kinship nor treaty[12]? They please you with their tongues, while their hearts are averse to it, and most of them are wicked. . They have sold the verses of Allah for a small price and prevented [people] from His way[13]. Terrible is indeed what they have done! . They do not honor the ties of kinship or treaties with regard to the believers. It is they who are the transgressors. .

of them? God is more worthy of your fear, when you fail to fight them, if you are believers. Fight them, and God will chadise them. He will have them killed, at your hands and degrade 
them, humiliate them through capture and subjugation, and He will give you vidory againd them, and 
He will heal the breads of a people who believe, [removing the harm] done to them — these are the

to another, as they used to do during paganism, such as postponing the sacredness of Muharram, if it 
arrives while they are at war, to Safar — is only an excess of unbelief, because of their rejection of God’s

the individual months themselves; and so they profane what God has hallowed. Their evil deeds have 
been adorned for them, such that they deem them to be good [deeds]; and God does not guide the dis¬ 
believing folk.","The number of months with Allah is twelve, in the Record of Allah[32] since the day He created the heavens and earth; of which four are sacred. This is the straight way, so do not wrong yourselves during these months[33], and fight the polytheists all together[34], just as they fight you all together. And know that Allah is with those who fear Him. . The postponement of [Sacred Months] is an act of disbelief[35], which leads them further astray. They declare a month lawful in one year and sacred the next year, in order to match the number of months that Allah has declared as sacred, thus making lawful what Allah has made forbidden[36]; their evil deeds have been made appealing to them, and Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.","[32] i.e., the Preserved Tablet.

9,38,40,"When the Prophet (s) summoned men for the Tabtik campaign, 4 and they thought it too burden¬ 
some, because of the hardship and the extreme heat from which they were suffering, the following was 
revealed: O you who believe, what is wrong with you that, when it is said to you, ‘Goforth in the way 
of God,’ you sink down heavily ( iththaqaltum: the original ta [of tathaqaltum] has been assimilated with 
the tha, and the conjunctive hamza has been supplied), in other words, you hesitate and are disinclined 
to [participate in] the struggle, to the ground, to ,ftay sitting upon it? (the interrogative is meant as a 
rebuke). Are you so content with the life of this world, and its delights, rather than with the Hereafter?, 
that is, in place of its bliss? Yet the enjoyment of the life of this world is, in, comparison with the enjoy¬ 
ment of, the Hereafter but little, trivial. 

[9 : 39] If (Mu'- Id has been assimilated with the nun of the conditional particle in, in both instances [here 
and in the next verse]) you do not go forth, [if you do not] set out with the Prophet (s) for the struggle, 
He will chastise you with a painful chastisement, and He will substitute [you with] another folk other 
than you, that is. He will bring them in your place, and you will not hurt Him, that is, God, or [‘him’ as 
being] the Prophet (s), at all, should you negledt to help him [to victory], for God [Himself] will indeed 
bring victory to His religion; for God has power over all things, including bringing victory to His reli¬ 
gion and His Prophet.  If you do not help him, that is, the Prophet (s), [know that] God has already helped him, when the 
disbelievers drove him forth, from Mecca, that is, they made him resort to leaving, when they desired to 
kill him or imprison him or banish him at the council assembly — the second of two (thdniya ithnayn: 
this is a circumstantial qualifier), that is, one of two, the other being Abu Bakr: in other words, juSt as 
God helped him in such a situation, He will not forsake him in another; when ( idh substitutes for the 
previous idh) the two were in the cave — a breach in the mountain called Thawr — when (idh substitut¬ 
ing again), he said to his companion, Abu Bakr — who, upon perceiving the [sound of the] feet of the 
idolaters [nearby], had said to him, ‘If one of them should merely look below his feet, he will definitely 
see us! ’ — ‘Do not despair; verily God is with us’, assisting [us]. Then God sent down His Spirit of Peace 
upon him. His reassurance — some say this means upon the Prophet, others, that it means upon Abu 
Bakr — and supported him, that is, the Prophet (s), with legions, of angels, you did not see, [both] in the 
cave and in the locations in which he fought battles; and He made the word of those who disbelieved, 
that is, the call to idolatry, the nethermost, the one vanquished, and the Word of God, that is, the pro¬ 
fession of His Oneness ( shahada ), was the uppermost, the one prevailing and triumphant. And God is 
Mighty, in His Kingdom, Wise, in His actions.","O you who believe, what is the matter with you that when you are asked to march forth in the cause of Allah, you cling heavily to the earth[37]? Are you content with the life of this world instead of the Hereafter? But the enjoyment of the life of this world is insignificant compared to that of the Hereafter. . Unless you march forth, He will chastise you with a painful punishment and replace you with other people, and you cannot harm Him in the least, for Allah is Most Capable of all things. . If you do not support the Prophet, Allah has already supported him when the disbelievers forced him out; when he was second of the two[38] in the cave – saying to his companion, “Do not grieve; Allah is with us.” Thereupon Allah sent down His tranquility upon him, supported him with soldiers that you did not see[39], and rendered the word of the disbelievers[40] the lowest, whereas the Word of Allah[41] is supreme. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.","[37] i.e., inclining toward the comforts of the worldly life. . [38] The second was his companion, Abu Bakr.

4 By the year 9/630, the Emperor Heraclius had secured a series of victories against the Persian empire, forcing the latter to with¬ 
draw their troops from Syria. The fledgling Muslim Sate gradually came under pressure to read: before the Byzantines would make 
their inevitable incursions into southern Syria and Northern Arabia towards Yathrib. The Prophet assembled his larged army ever, 
and some 30,000 men, drawn from Mecca, Medina and the allied tribes, would join the trek up the northern coasT of the Hijaz 
towards Syro Palestine and to the spring of Tabuk. The year was a particularly hot one and, despite the large number of men as¬ 
sembled, many leading Medinese, together with numerous ‘hypocrites’, had preferred to day behind — this is the concern of the 
verse above — for they saw no potential gain in the expedition to Syria: the Prophet himself was particularly disappointed by the 
absence of some. The anticipated Byzantine assault never materialised, but the Muslim army, through a series of skirmishes againd 
the Band Ghassan (the main defenders of Byzantine intereds on the Syrian frontier) were able to assert, by their presence, the au¬ 
thority of the Muslim date in the region; see M. G. S. Hodgson, The Venture of Islam: volume 1, the classical age of Islam (Chicago:

pleasure of this world, and an easy journey, of moderate [length], they would have followed you, seek¬ 
ing spoils; but the difiance, the hardship, was too great for them, and so they stayed behind. Still they 
will swear by God, when you return to them: [saying]: ‘Had we been able, to go forth, we woidd have 
gone forth with you,’ defiroying their soids, by swearing false oaths, and God knows that they truly are 
liars, in this saying of theirs. The Prophet (s), exercising his personal judgement, had given leave to a group to ^tay behind, and 
so the following was revealed as a reprimand for him, but with the pardon fir£t, in order to reassure his 
heart: May God pardon you! Why do you give them leave, to stay behind; why did you not leave them, 
until it was clear to you which of them Cpoke the truth, in their excuse, and you knew those who were 
lying, in it? Those who believe in God and the Lafi Day do not ask leave of you, to s'tay behind, that they may 
firuggle with their possessions and their lives; and God knows the pious. They alone ask leave of you, to stay behind, who do not believe in God and the Lafi Day, and 
whose hearts are doubtful, uncertain, about religion, so in their doubt they waver, they are confused. If they had desired to go forth, with you, they woidd have made some preparation for it, some 
equipment, such as tools and provisions, but God was averse that they should be sent forth, that is, He 
did not want them to go forth, so He slowed them down. He made them [feel] lethargic, and it was said, 
to them: ‘Stay back with those who fiay back!’, [with] the sick, the women and the children: in other 
words, God decreed this. Had they gone forth among you, they would only have caused you more trouble, [more] corrup¬ 
tion, by abandoning the believers, and would have hurried to and fro among you, that is, they would 
have hastened to ^read slander among you, seeking, desiring, to fiir up sedition, by casting enmity, 
between you; and among you there are some who would lifien to them, to what they say, listening in 
readiness to accept it; and God knows the evildoers. Indeed, they sought to fiir up sedition, against you, already before, when you firs't came to Me¬ 
dina, and scrutinised your affairs, that is, they thought long and hard how to plot against you and 
invalidate your religion, until the truth, the [victorious] help, came, and God’s command. His religion, 
prevailed, stood mighty, they fiill being averse, to it [His religion], entering it superficially. And there are some of them who say, ‘Grant me leave, to .ftay behind, and do not lead me into 
temptation’: this was al-Jadd b. Qays, 5 to whom the Prophet (s) said, ‘Will you do battle against the 
Byzantines?’, 6 and to which he replied, ‘I am infatuated with women, and I fear that if I were to see these 
Byzantine women, I shall not be able to it ay away from them and be led into temptation’. God, exalted 
be He, says: Surely they have [already] fallen into temptation!, by staying behind (a variant reading [for 
saqatu, ‘they have fallen] has [the singular form] saqat, ‘he has fallen) , 7 And surely Hell shall encompass 
the disbelievers, for whom there shall be no escape therefrom.","If it had been an easy win within reach and a short journey, those [hypocrites] would have followed you, but the distance seemed too far for them. They will swear by Allah[43], “If we had been able, we would have surely joined you,” destroying themselves [through false oaths], and Allah knows that they are liars. . May Allah pardon you [O Prophet]! Why did you give them permission [to stay behind] before it became clear to you as to who were telling the truth, and who were liars[44]? . Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day will not ask you to be exempted from striving with their wealth and their lives in Allah’s cause. Allah is All-Knowing of those who fear Him. . Only those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day ask permission to be exempted; they have doubts in their hearts, so they will continue to waver in their doubts. . If they had truly intended to march forth, they would have made necessary preparations for it. But Allah disliked their going forth, so He made them lag behind, and they were told, “Stay behind with those who are staying behind[45].” . If they had gone forth with you, they would have only increased you in disorder and would have scurried around, sowing discord among you, and some of you would have listened to them. And Allah is All-Knowing of the wrongdoers. . They had surely sought to sow discord before and devised plots against you [O Prophet][46] until the truth [i.e., victory] came and Allah’s decree [i.e., religion] prevailed, even though they were averse. . There are some among them who say, “Exempt me and do not expose me to temptation.” They have already fallen into temptation[47]. Hell will certainly encompass the disbelievers.","[43] When you return from the Tabūk expedition in which the hypocrites did not participate. . [44] None should have been given permission, so as to see who would set out with the Muslim army, the truthful; and who would not, the liars. . [45] i.e., the terminally weak, women and children. .

with the revelation of this verse, for he had asked the Prophet to excuse him from the Tabuk campaign, offering his wealth as sup¬ 
port instead. There is some indication that he may have made a sincere repentance afterwards, but this is not ascertainable by any 
means. Jadd died during the caliphate of‘Uthman b. ‘Affan (r. 24-37/644-656); Ibn al-Athlr, Usd, 1, 521.

put their truit’. Say: ‘Are you waiting (tarabbasun : one of the two original fa'letters [in tatarabbasun] has been

waiting in your case too, for God to afflidyou with a chadisement from Him, with a calamity from the 
heaven, or at our hands, should we be given permission to fight you. So wait, for this to [befall] us, we 
are also waiting with you’, your end.","If something good happens to you, it grieves them, but if a disaster befalls you, they say, “We have taken our precautions beforehand[48],” and they turn away rejoicing. . Say, “Nothing will ever befall us except that which Allah has decreed for us; He is our Protector.” And in Allah alone let the believers put their trust. . Say, “Are you awaiting to befall us except one of the two fine things [i.e., victory or martyrdom][49]? But we are awaiting that Allah will afflict you with punishment from Himself or at our hands. So wait; we too are waiting with you.”","[48] The hypocrites claim to have protected themselves by not setting out on the campaign. . [49] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “When your brothers were struck down in the Battle of Badr, Allah placed their souls in the abdominal cavities of green fowls, they drink from the rivers of Paradise, eat from its fruits and come back at the end of the day to repose in chandeliers hung in the Shadow of the Majestic Throne...” [Abū Dāwūd: 2520, Ahmad: 2388]"
9,53,55,"Say: ‘Expend, in obedience to God, willingly or unwillingly, it, what you expend, shall not be 
accepted from you; you are surely a wicked folk’ (the imperative statement here [also] functions as a 
predicate). And nothing prevents their expenditure from being accepted (read as yuqbala or tuqbala) from 
them, but that they (innahum is the subject of the verb, while an tuqbala, ‘being accepted’ constitutes 
the objed) have disbelieved in God and His Messenger, and that they do not come to [perform] prayer 
save as idlers, sluggishly, and that they do not expend without their being reludant, to expend, for they 
consider it a financial penalty. So do not let their wealth or their children please you, that is, do not deem fair Our graces to 
them, for this is a [way of] drawing [them] on by degrees [to punish them]: God only desires thereby 
to chadise them in the life of this world, by way of the hardship that they encounter in amassing such 
[wealth and children] and the calamities [they suffer] as a result thereof; and that their soids should de¬ 
part while they are disbelievers, so He punishes them in the Hereafter with the word punishment.","Say, “Whether you spend willingly or unwillingly, it will never be accepted from you, for you have been a wicked people.” . Nothing prevents the acceptance of their spending except that they disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger, they do not come to prayer but lazily[50], and they do not spend but reluctantly. . So do not let their wealth or their children impress you; Allah only intends to punish them through these things in the life of this world and to let their souls depart while they are still disbelievers.","[50] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ""No prayer is heavier for the hypocrites than the Fajr and the ‘Isha’ prayers; but if they knew the reward for these prayers at their respective times, they would certainly attend even if they had to crawl..."" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 626]"
9,56,59,"And they swear by God that they truly are of you, that is, [that they are] believers; but they are 
not of you; they are a folk who are afraid, that you should deal with them as you have done with the 
idolaters, and so they swear merely in pretence, in order to protect themselves.

better for them’).","They swear by Allah that they belong to you[51], but they do not belong to you; rather they are a people who are afraid [of you]. .

If only they had been pleased with that which Allah and His Messenger gave them, and said, “Allah is sufficient for us; Allah will give us out of His bounty, and so will His Messenger; to Allah alone we turn with hope.”","[51] In their precarious situation, they lie as a line of defence. .

9 The verb kataba derives from mukataba, one of several legal ways by which a slave can secure manumission from his mader. A 
slave becomes a mukatab when he makes a contrad with his mader to acquire his freedom upon future payment to the latter of a 
mutually agreed-upon sum of money; mod often the slave will pay by indalments. The mukatab slave may — but has no legal claim 
to — receive financial assidance for his contrad from the proceeds of the alms-tax; see Schacht, Introdudion, 129k; Ibn Manzur,

fulfil [the penalty of expiation], or to set things right between people, even if they be wealthy; and, for 
the way of God, that is, [for] those who are engaged in the Struggle, of those for whom there is no [share 
of the] booty (fay 1 ),"" even if they be wealthy; and for the traveller, the one cut off [from resources] dur¬ 
ing his journey — a duty imposed by God (faridatan, ‘a duty’, is in the accusative because of an implied 
verb [s c. faradaha, ‘which He has imposed’]). And God is Knower, of His creatures, Wise, in His acftions. 
Thus, it is impermissible to dispense these [alms-proceeds] other than to these [categories], or to deny 
[these proceeds to] any one of these [categories] if they exi£t. The Imam mu£t divide these [proceeds] 
among them equally, but he is permitted to give priority to certain individuals over others within any one 
category. The lam [of li’l-fuqara, ‘for the poor’] indicates that it is obligatory to include every individual 
[of these categories in the distribution of the proceeds]; it is not, however, obligatory [to do so] when 
the person in charge of the monies has to apportion it but [finds that] it is insufficient. Indeed [in such 
a situation] it suffices to give three individuals from each category, but anything less than that is not suf¬ 
ficient, as is indicated by the plural form. 12 The Sunna shows that the prerequisite condition for receiving 
[a share] of such [monies] is that the person be a Muslim, but not a Hashimi or a Muttalibl. And of them, the hypocrites, are those who injure the Prophet, by casting aversions on him and 
communicating [to others] what he says [in confidence], saying, when they are forbidden from [doing] 
this, ledt it should reach him: ‘He is only a listener!’, that is, he listens to anything that is said, and ac¬ 
cepts it, so that when we swear to him that we have not communicated [to others] a particular thing, 
he believes us. Say, he is, ‘A listener, who listens, to good for you, and not one who listens to evil, one 
who believes in God and has faith, he trusts, in the believers, in what they inform him, and not in oth¬ 
ers (the lam [of li’l-mu’minina, ‘in the believers’] has been added to distinguish between belief in the 
sense of‘submitting [to God]’ ( islam ), and in other senses [such as ‘trusting’]) and who is a mercy (read 
rahmatun, in the nominative, as a supplement to udhunun, ‘a listener’, or rahmatin, in the genitive, as a 
supplement to khayrin, ‘to good’) to those of you who believe. Those who injure God’s Messenger, for 
them there is a painful chastisement’.","Alms [i.e., zakah] is only for the poor and the needy; those in charge of it; those whose hearts may be attracted [to Islam]; for freeing those in bondage; for those in debt; for the cause of Allah; and for [the stranded] traveler[54] – as ordained by Allah, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. . Among those [hypocrites] are some who offend the Prophet and say, “He listens to everyone[55].” Say [O Prophet], “He listens to what is best for you[56]; he believes in Allah, trusts the believers, and is a mercy for those of you who believe.” But for those who offend the Messenger of Allah, there will be a painful punishment.","[54] See 2:83, 2:273. . [55] i.e., he believes everything he hears.
 [56] i.e., he listens but to what is good and not to evil; he listens and overlooks; he turns a blind eye when you come with fabrications."
9,62,66,"Tltey swear by God to you, O believers, that what has reached you of the Messenger being injured 
they did not do, so that they might please you, but God and His Messenger are more deserving that 
they should please them, through obedience, if they are, true, believers (the merging of the pronouns 
into one [in yurduhu, ‘their pleasing them] is because the ‘pleasure’ of both [God and His Messenger] 
are mutually dependent; [either that] or it is because the predicate of Allahu wa-rasuluhu, ‘God and His 
Messenger’, has been omitted). Do they not know that, the facft is that, whoever opposes God and His Messenger, for him shall be 
the fire of Hell, as a requital, to abide therein? That is the great abasement. The hypocrites are cautious, they fear, left a sura should be revealed to them, that is, [to] the 

10 The hashir is the person who receives the alms without having to go and colled: it himself: those obliged to pay the alms would 
have to come to him, as opposed to him going to gather it from different areas. The delegation sent by Banu Thaqif to make peace 
with the Prophet stipulated that they did not want to be summoned to pay (an la yuhsharu) the alms-colledor, but that he would 
have to come and colled it from their different dwelling-places; see Ibn Manzur, Lisan, s.v. ‘h-sh-r’ (m, 185). 

11 The term fay’ may be translated ‘booty’ since, unlike Spoils (ghanima ) which are seized by force or in war, it denotes property or 
wealth that has come to Muslims without any (Strenuous) effort on their part, or any resistance on the part of those non-Muslims 
conquered; by extension, the kharaj, the tax levied on the non-Muslim producers of landed property, is also considered fay (it 
should be added, however, that this land-tax, kharaj, is a fixed charge and remains due even if the owner of the land becomes a 
Muslim, or if it changes hands and becomes the property of a Muslim; see Schacht, Introdudion, 131).

believers, informing them of what is in their [the hypocrites’] hearts, of hypocrisy, and yet despite this 
they persist in mockery. Say: ‘Keep mocking! (this is an imperative of threat) God will bring out. He will 
make manifest, that, hypocrisy of yours, of which you are fearful’, le£t it be brought out. And if (la-in: the lam is for oaths) you question them, about their mockery of you and of the 
Qur’an while they were journeying with you towards Tabuk, assuredly they will say, making excuses: 
""We were only engaging [in idle talk] and jetting’, in conversation, in order to pass [the time of] the 
road, and we did not mean it. Say, to them: ‘Were you then mocking God, and His signs, and His Mes¬ 
senger? Make no excuses, for that. You have disbelieved after believing, that is, your disbelief has become 
manifest even as you have manifested belief. If We forgive (read passive yufa, ‘it is forgiven, or acftive 
[firSt person plural] nafu, ‘We forgive’) a party of you, because of its sincerity and its repentance, as in 
the case ofJahsh b. Humayyir, 13 We will chaStise (read either [passive] tuadhdhab, ‘[it] shall be chas¬ 
tised’, or nuadhdhib ) 14 another party because they were sinners’, persisting in hypocrisy and mockery.","They swear by Allah to you [O Muslims] to please you, but it is Allah and His Messenger whose pleasure they should seek, if they are true believers. . Do they not know that whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger will dwell in the Fire of Hell forever? That is the ultimate disgrace. . The hypocrites fear that a chapter should be sent down about them, informing [the believers] of what is in their hearts[57]. Say [O Prophet], “Keep on mocking! Allah will certainly expose what you fear.” . If you question them, they will surely say, “We were only indulging in idle talk and playing.” Say, “Was it Allah, His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking[58]?” . Make no excuses; you have disbelieved after having believed[59]. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others because they are wicked.","[57] i.e., exposing their disbelief. . [58] ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar (رضي الله عنهما) reported: “During the Tabuk Expedition a man said in a gathering: “I have not seen anyone who is more gluttonous, lying and cowardly than these reciters of ours!” A man in the same gathering replied to him: “Liar! You are indeed a hypocrite! I shall tell the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)!” When the news reached the Messenger (ﷺ), verses from the Qur’an came down regarding the incident.” The narrator continues: “I saw him clinging to the belly strap of the Messenger’s (ﷺ) she-camel, saying: “Messenger of Allah! We were only chit-chatting and passing time!” While the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was reciting: “Were you mocking of Allah, His Signs, and His Messenger”. [cf. Ibn Abī Hātim, al-Tabarī, al-Shinqītī] . [59] However, the door of repentance is still open for them."
9,67,68,"The hypocrites, both men and women, are of one another, that is, they resemble one another in 
religion, as pieces of an individual entity, they enjoin indecency, unbelief and acfts of disobedience, and 
forbid decency, faith and obedience; and they withhold their hands shut, from expending in obedience 
[of God]; they have forgotten God, they have abandoned obedience of Him, so He has forgotten them. 
He has deprived them of His grace. Truly the hypocrites, they are the wicked. God has promised the hypocrites, both men and women, and the disbelievers, the fire of Hell, 
to abide therein: it will suffice them, as a requital and a punishment. And God has cursed them. He has 
removed them from His mercy, and theirs will be a lasting, perpetual, chastisement.","The hypocrites, both men and women, are all alike; they enjoin what is evil and forbid what is good, and they withhold their hands [from giving][60]. They forgot Allah, so He forgot them. Indeed, the hypocrites are the rebellious. . Allah has promised the hypocrites, both men and women, and the disbelievers the Fire of Hell, abiding therein forever – it is sufficient for them. Allah has cursed them, and for them there will be an everlasting punishment.","[60] i.e., from spending in the way of Allah."
9,69,70,"You, O hypocrites, are, like those before you, who were far mightier than you, and more abundant 
in wealth and children. They enjoyed their share, their lot in this world. So you enjoy, O hypocrites, 
your share, juSt as those before you enjoyed their share, and you indulge [in vain talk], in falsehood 
and defamation of the Prophet ( s),juSt as they indulged [in vain talk]. Those, their works have become 
invalid in this world and in the Hereafter; and those, they indeed are the losers. Has not the tidings, the tale, of those before them reached them — the folk of Noah, and c Ad, the 
folk of Hud, and Thamiid, the folk of Salih, and the folk of Abraham, and the dwellers of Midian, the 
folk of Shu'ayb, and the Deviant [cities]?, the cities of the folk of Lot, meaning, its inhabitants. T heir 
messengers brought them clear proofs, with miracles, but they denied them, and so were destroyed. 
God wotdd never have wronged them, by punishing them for no sin [on their part], but they wronged 
themselves, by committing sin.","[O hypocrites, you are] like those who came before you, who were more powerful than you and more abundant in wealth and children. They enjoyed their share, and you too have enjoyed your share just as those who came before you enjoyed their share; and you have indulged in idle talk just as they did. Such are those whose deeds have become worthless in this world and in the Hereafter; it is they who are the losers. . Have they not received the stories of those who came before them: the people of Noah, ‘Ād, Thamūd, the people of Abraham, the dwellers of Midian, and the overturned cities [of Lot]? Their messengers came to them with clear signs. It was not Allah who wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves.",
9,71,72,"And the believers, both men and women, are allies of one another; they enjoin decency and 
forbid indecency; they observe prayer and pay the alms, and they obey God and His Messenger. Those, 
God will have mercy on them. Truly God is Mighty, nothing can prevent Him from fulfilling His prom¬ 
ise and His threat; Wise, He puts everything in its proper place. God has promised the believers, both men and women, Gardens underneath which rivers flow, 
to abide therein, and blessed dwellings in the Gardens of Eden, for residence, and beatitude from God 
is greater, is superior to all of that. That is the supreme triumph. 

[ 973 ] O Prophet, Struggle again St the disbelievers, with the sword, and the hypocrites, with words and 
[definitive] arguments, and be harsh with them, through rebuke and aversion [towards them]; for their 
abode will be Hell, an evil journey’s end, [an evil] resort it is! 

13 This should probably be read as Makhshi b. Humayyir, ai AshjaT, a confederate of the Banu Salima of the Ansar, since he is the 
one associated with the forgiveness mentioned in the verse above; see Tabari account of the Tabuk episode (Tarikh, II.i, 54, sub 
anno 9); cf. Ibn al-Athir, Usd, v, i2of. 

14 The choice of variants here is dependent upon the choice in the previous verb: if yufa, then tuadhdhab, and if nafu, then 
nuadhdhib.

Tafsir al-Jalalayn","The believers, both men and women, are allies of one another; they enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, they establish prayer, give zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. It is they who will receive Allah’s mercy, for Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. . Allah has promised the believers, both men and women, gardens under which rivers flow, abiding therein forever, and splendid dwellings in the Gardens of Eternity, and Allah’s pleasure, which is the greatest of all; that is the supreme triumph.",
9,73,74," They, the hypocrites, swear by God that they said nothing, of the defamation that has reached you 
[as being] from them; but they did indeed say the word of disbelief and did disbelieve after their sub¬ 
mission [to God]-, they did indeed manifest disbelief after having manifested submission [to God]. And 
they purposed that which they never attained, in the way of assassinating the Prophet on the night of 
al-'Aqaba, upon his return from Tabuk — there were about ten to twenty of them, and ‘Ammar b. Yasir 
Struck the faces of their riding camels when they came againSt him and were thus repulsed; and they 
were only spiteful, they deteSted, that God and His Messenger should have enriched them of His bounty, 
by way of Spoils, when they had been in dire need: the meaning is that this was all that they attained from 
him, which is nothing to be Spiteful about. So if they repent, of hypocrisy and believe in you, it will be 
better for them; but if they turn away, from belief, God will chastise them with a painful chastisement 
in this world, by having them killed, and in the Hereafter, in the Fire, and they have none on earth as 
protedor, to guard them from Him, or helper, to defend them.","O Prophet, strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be harsh with them. Their abode is Hell. What a terrible destination! . They swear by Allah that they said nothing [blasphemous], while they indeed uttered a word of blasphemy[61], and disbelieved after accepting Islam, and plotted what they could not achieve[62]. They are spiteful [against believers] for no reason except that Allah and His Messenger have enriched them out of His bounty. If they repent, it will be better for them, but if they turn away, Allah will chastise them with a painful punishment in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will have on earth no protector or helper.","[61] such as insulting the Messenger (ﷺ) and attacking the religion.
 [62] They devised to assassinate the Prophet (ﷺ) upon his return from the Tabuk Expedition, but their plot was foiled."
9,75,80,"And some of them have made a covenant with God [saying]: ‘If He gives us of His bounty, we will 
give voluntary alms ( la-nassaddaqanna : the original ta [of natasaddaqanna] has been assimilated with 
the sad ) and become of the righteous’: this was Tha'laba b. Hatib, 15 who asked the Prophet (s) to sup¬ 
plicate on his behalf so that God would give him wealth, of which he would give every needy person his 
due. He [the Prophet] thus supplicated for him and he became wealthy, but Stopped attending the Friday 
prayer and congregational prayers and refused to pay the alms-tax, as God, exalted be He, says: Yet when He gave them of His bounty, they became niggardly with it and turned away, from 
obedience to God, in aversion. 

[977] So He made the consequence in their case hypocrisy, fixed, in their hearts, until the day they 
meet Him, that is, God, on the Day of Resurrection, because they failed God in what they promised 
Him and because, of that concerning which, they lied: he [Tha'laba] then brought [the payment of] his 
alms to the Prophet (s), who said to him, ‘God has forbidden me to accept [it] from you’; so he [Tha'laba] 
began to throw earth on his head [in remorse]. He then approached Abu Bakr with it, who did not accept 
it. He then went to ‘Umar [b. al-Khattab], who also did not accept it. He went to ‘Uthman [b. ‘Affan], but 
he did not accept it; he died during the latter’s reign. 16  Did they, the hypocrites, not know that God knows their secret, what they conceal within them¬ 
selves, and their confidential talks, what they confide in each other, and that God is the Knower of the 
hidden things?, what is concealed from the eyes. When the verse concerning ‘voluntary alms’ [Q. 9:75] was revealed, a man came and gave a large 
amount as voluntary alms, so the hypocrites said, ‘He is [merely] showing off!’ Another man then came 
and gave a [moderate] measure [of food], and so they said, ‘God has no need of this man’s charity!’ The 
following was then revealed: Those who (alladhina is the subjed) find fault with, defame, the believers 
who offer alms voluntarily, performing supererogation, and such as find nothing [to offer] but their 
endeavours, [nothing but] what they are capable of, and offer it; and deride them (and the predicate 
[of the mentioned subjed:] is [the following]) — God [Himself] derides them. He has requited them for 
their derision, and theirs will be a painful chastisement. Ask forgiveness for them, O Muhammad (s), or do not ask forgiveness for them: this leaves the 
choice of asking forgiveness, or refraining, up to him; the Prophet (s) said, ‘I have been given the choice, 
and I made it’, meaning [the choice] to ask forgiveness, as reported by al-Bukharl. If you ask forgiveness 
for them seventy times, God will not forgive them: it is said that the ‘seventy’ is intended to express [by 
hyperbole] a great frequency of asking forgiveness. In [the Sahih of] al-Bukharl there is a hadith [which 
dates]: ‘If I was sure that were I to ask more than seventy times, God would forgive [them], I would 
have done so’. It is also said, however, that the very number [seventy] is adually meant, on account of 
this other hadith of his: ‘I shall ask more than seventy times’, whereupon it was made clear to him [the 

15 Tha'laba b. Hatib al-Ansar! al-Awsi: Ibn al-Athir gives a detailed account of this episode in his prosopography of Tha'laba; see, 
Ibn al-Athir, Usd, 1, 462-64. 

16 The account given by Ibn al-Athir is that Tha'laba approached Abu Bakr after the Prophet had died, and approached each of the 
other two upon their succession of the previous caliph. Tha'laba was rejected every time.

Prophet] that the matter regarding forgiveness had been concluded by the verse, [Q. 63:6] Alike it will 
be regarding them-, whether you ask forgiveness for them or you do not ask forgiveness for them [God will 
not forgive them]; that is because they disbelieved in God and His Messenger; and God does not guide 
the wicked folk.","There are some among them who made a covenant with Allah: “If He gives us out of His bounty, we will surely spend in charity and be among the righteous.” . But when He did give them out of His bounty, they grew stingy and turned away in aversion. . So as a consequence, He caused hypocrisy to take root in their hearts until the Day they meet Him, because of breaking their promise to Allah, and because of their persistent lying. . Do they not know that Allah knows their secret and private conversations and that Allah is the All-Knower of all unseen? . Those who disparage the believers who voluntarily give charities and ridicule them for having nothing to give except their effort[63]. Allah will ridicule them, and for them there will be a painful punishment. . Whether you [O Prophet] seek forgiveness for them or not, even if you seek forgiveness for them seventy times[64], Allah will never forgive them[65]; that is because they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger. Allah does not guide the rebellious people.","[63] They hurtle sneering comments on both the well-off who give generously, saying that they do so out of show off, and those who can only help with the very little they have, and deride them for it. . [64] The number 70 is not meant, but is rather used to denote numerousness per se.
 [65] ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb (رضي الله عنه) reported: “When ‘Abdullāh ibn ’Ubayy ibn Salūl died, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was summoned to Pray for him. As He (ﷺ) stood up, I sprang to him and said: “Messenger of Allah, will you pray over Ibn ’Ubayy, in spite of him saying so and so on the day of so and so!” I recounted to him (ﷺ) what he said. The Messenger (ﷺ) smiled and said: “Move away from me ‘Umar.” When I had argued a great deal with him, he said: “I was given a choice and I made my choice. Had I known that if I were to seek forgiveness for him more than seventy times he would be forgiven, I would have sought it more!” The Messenger (ﷺ) prayed and then left. It was just a short while after that the two verses in Barā’ah (al-Tawbah) came down: “Do not ever pray over anyone of them who dies … died while in a state of contravention”…” [Al-Bukhārī: 1366]."
9,81,85,"Those who were left behind, from [the journey to] Tabuk, rejoiced at remaining behind the Mes¬ 
senger of God, and were averse to Striving with their wealth and their lives in the way of God. And they 
said, that is, they said to one another, ‘Do not go forth, do not set off to [join] the fight, in the heat!’ Say: 
‘The fire of Hell is hotter, than Tabuk, and more worthy for them to guard against, by not staying behind, 
did they but understand’, this, they would not have stayed behind. But let them laugh a little, in this world, and weep much, in the Hereafter, as a requital for what 
they used to earn (the sentence is predicative of their itate, expressed in the form of an imperative). So if God brings you back, from Tabuk, to a party of them, of those hypocrites who stayed be¬ 
hind in Medina, and they ask leave of you to go forth, with you on some other campaign, say, to them: 
‘You shall never more go forth with me, and you shall never fight with me againSt an enemy. You were 
content to Slay behind the firSt time, so Slay behind with those who Slay behind’, away from [military] 
campaigns, such as women and children and others. When the Prophet (s) prayed over [the dead body of ! Abd Allah] Ibn Ubayy, the following was 
revealed: And never pray over any one of them when he is dead, nor Stand over his grave, at a burial 
or as a visit; lo! they disbelieved in God and His Messenger, and died while they were wicked, [they 
died] disbelieving. And let not their wealth and their children please you; God desires only to chaSlise them thereby 
in this world, and that their souls should depart while they are disbelievers.","Those who remained behind rejoiced for doing so in defiance of the Messenger of Allah, and disliked to strive in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives[66], and said, “Do not march forth in this heat[67].” Say, “The Fire of Hell is more intense in heat.” – If only they could understand! . Let them laugh a little and weep a lot as a recompense for what they used to do. . If Allah brings you back to a group of them and they ask your permission to go forth with you, say, “You will never go forth with me, nor will you ever fight an enemy with me. You were content to remain behind the first time, so now stay with those who remained behind[68].” . Never offer the funeral prayer for any of them who dies, nor stand by his grave, for they have disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and died as evildoers. . Do not let their wealth or their children impress you; Allah only intends to punish them with these things in this world, and to let their souls depart while they are disbelievers[69].","[66] While in reality, Allah had prevented their participation knowing of their hypocrisy and evil intent.
 [67] In the Tabuk Expedition. . [68] It is used here to impart a derogatory sense because of their incapacity. . [69] The wording of this verse is almost identical to verse 55 above, reiterating its message."
9,86,87,"And when a sura, that is, a secftion of the Qur’an, is revealed, saying: ‘Believe in God and Strive 
with His Messenger’, the affluent among them ask leave of you, saying, ‘Leave us to be with those who 
sit at home’. They are content to be with those who Slay behind (khawdlif is the plural of khalifa, meaning the 
women who ‘ 3 tay behind’ [takhallafna] at home) and a seal has been set upon their hearts, so they do 
not understand, [what is] good.","Whenever a Chapter is sent down [saying], “Believe in Allah and fight along with His Messenger,” the affluent among them would ask you to excuse them, saying, “Let us remain with those who stay behind[70].” . They are content to be with those helpless who stay behind[71]; their hearts have been sealed, so that they do not understand.","[70] i.e., the weak, the terminally ill and the incapacitated. .

account of their excuses, and so he gave them leave to do so. And those who lied to God and His Messen¬

a circumstantial qualifier), turned back (this is the response to the [clause beginning with] idha, ‘when’), 
that is, they departed, their eyes flowing, pouring, with tears (min al-dami: min is explicative) for sor¬

They are content to be with those who Hay behind and God has set a seal on their hearts, so that they 
do not know: a similar Statement has already been made. They will make excuses to you, for having Stayed behind, when you return to them, from the cam¬ 
paign. Say, to them: ‘Do not make excuses; we will never believe you! God has already told us tidings of 
you, that is. He has already informed us of your [true] Status. And God will see your work, and [so will] 
His Messenger, then you will be returned, through resurrection, to the Knower of the unseen and the 
visible, meaning [to] God, and He will tell you what you used to do’, and requite you for it. They will swear to you by God, when you turn back, [when] you return, to them, from Tabuk, that 
they had [genuine] excuses for Staying behind, so that you may leave them be, refraining from reproach¬ 
ing them. So leave them be, for they are an abomination, filth, on account of their inner vileness, and 
their abode shall be Hell, as requital for what they used to earn. They will swear to you, that you may be satisfied with them; but if you are satisfied with them, 
God will surely not be satisfied with the wicked folk, that is, with them: your satisfaction is of no avail in 
the face of the wrath of God.","Some of the Bedouins came with excuses, seeking to be exempted, while others who lied to Allah and His Messenger stayed behind. Those who disbelieved among them will be afflicted with a painful punishment. . There is no blame on the weak, the sick, or those who have nothing to spend, as long as they are sincere to Allah and His Messenger.

Nor is there any blame on those who came to you asking you for mounts to take them along, and you said, “I can find no mounts for you;” they turned away with their eyes overflowing with tears out of grief that they had nothing to spend. . Blame is only on those who ask you for exemption even though they are affluent. They are content to stay behind with the helpless[72], and Allah has sealed their hearts so they do not know. . They will make excuses to you when you return to them. Say, “Make no excuses; we will never believe you[73]. Allah has already informed us about your affairs. Allah and His Messenger will see your deeds, then you will be brought back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen, and He will inform you of what you used to do.” . When you return to them, they will swear to you by Allah so that you may leave them alone. So leave them alone, for they are evil. Their abode is Hell, as a recompense for what they used to do. .

Qur’an, and are more likely not to know the bounds of what God has revealed to His Messenger, in 
the way of rulings and [legal] prescriptions; and God is Knower, of His creatures. Wise, in what He 
does with them. And of the Bedouins there is he who takes what he expends, in the way of God, as a penalty, as a 
liability and a [financial] loss, because he does not aSJure to be rewarded for it, but expends it out of fear: 
these were Banu Asad and [Banu] Ghatafan; and awaits for you [evil] turns of fortune, the fortunes of

al-su, or al-saw < ) turn of fortune, that is, chastisement and destruction shall turn on them, not on you. 
And God is Hearer, of the sayings of His servants, Knower, of their actions. And of the Bedouins there is he who believes in God and the TaSt Day, such as [men from among 
the tribes of] Juhayna and Muzayna, and takes what he expends, in the way of God, as [pious] offerings 
to bring [him] nearer to God, and, as a means, to [secure] the prayers, the supplications, of the Mes¬ 
senger, for him. Surely these, the expenditure of such [men], will bring them nearer (read qurubatun or 
qurbatun), to Him. God will admit them into His mercy. His Paradise. Truly God is Forgiving, to those 
who obey Him, Merciful, to them.","The Bedouins are worse in disbelief and hypocrisy, and less likely to know the limits sent down by Allah to His Messenger. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. . Among the Bedouins are some who consider what they spend as a loss and await some misfortune to befall you. May ill fortune befall them! And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. . However, there are some among the Bedouins who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and consider what they spend as a means of drawing closer to Allah, and of deserving the invocations of the Messenger.

ing them or having them killed in this world, and by way of punishment in the grave, then they will be 
returned, in the Hereafter, to a terrible chastisement, namely, the Fire. And [there are] others ( akharun is the subjecft), [another] folk, who have confessed their sins, 
for having stayed behind ( itarafu bi-dhunubihim is an adjectival qualification of it [the subjecft] and the 
predicate is [the following, khalatu 'arnalan salihan ]) they have mixed a righteous deed, that is, their 
former [participation in the] struggle, or the their confession of their sins, or otherwise, with another 
that was bad, which is their having stayed behind. It may be that God will relent to them. Tridy God is 
Forgiving, Merciful: this was revealed regarding Abu Lubaba and a group of men who tied themselves to 
the walls of the mosque after they heard what had been revealed regarding those who stayed behind; they 
swore that only the Prophet (s) would untie them, which he did when this [verse] was revealed. Take of their wealth some alms, to purify them and to cleanse them thereby, of their sins; he thus 
took a third of their wealth and gave it away as charity; and pray for them, that is, supplicate for them; 
truly your prayers are a comfort, a mercy, for them: it is also said [to mean] reassurance [for them], that 
their repentance has been accepted. And God is Hearer, Knower. Do they not know that God is He Who accepts repentance from His servants and takes, accepts, 
the voluntary alms, and that God is He Who is the Relenting, to His servants, by accepting their repent¬ 
ance, and the Merciful?, to them (the interrogative is intended as an affirmative [Statement] and is meant 
to incite them to [offer] repentance and charity). And say, to them, or to people [in general]: Ad, as you will, for God will surely see your actions, 
and [so will] His Messenger and the believers, and you will be returned, through resurrection, to the 
Knower of the unseen and the visible, that is, [to] God, and He will tell you what you used to do’, and 
so requite you for it. And [there are] others, from among those who stayed behind, who are deferred (read murja’una 
or murjawna ), whose repentance is delayed, to God’s command, concerning them, according to His 
will, whether He chastises them, by causing them to die without [their having made any] repentance, 
or relents to them; and God is Knower, of His creatures, Wise, in what He does with them. These [oth¬ 
ers mentioned] are the three, who will be mentioned afterwards: Murara b. al-Rabf, Ka‘b b. Malik and 
Hilal b. Umayya. They stayed behind out of laziness and their inclination for peace and quiet, not out of 
hypocrisy. Unlike the others, however, they did not excuse themselves before the Prophet (s), and so the 
matter regarding them was suspended for fifty days, during which time people avoided them, until it was 
later revealed that God had relented to them.","Among the Bedouins around you are some hypocrites, as are from the people of Madinah; they are obstinate in their hypocrisy[76]. You do not know them; We know them. We will punish them twice[77], and then they will be brought back to a great punishment[78]. . And there are others who admitted their sins; they have mixed righteous deeds with others that were evil[79]. It is likely that Allah will turn to them in mercy, for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. . Take charity from their wealth [O Prophet] to cleanse and purify them, and pray for them. Your prayer is a source of comfort for them. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. . Do they not know that it is Allah Who accepts the repentance of His slaves and accepts their charities, and that it is Allah Who is the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful? .

hypocrites — by way of harm, to cause distress for those of the mosque of Quba 1 , and disbelief, since 
they built it on the orders of the monk Abu ‘Amir, as a sanCtuary for him, so that whoever comes from 
his side may Stay there: he had gone to the Byzantine Emperor ( qaysar ) to bring troops to fight against 
the Prophet (s), and to cause division among the believers, who pray in the mosque of Quba 1 , by having 
some of these pray in their [the hypocrites’] mosque, 17 and as an outpod, an observation post, for those 
who waged war againd God and His Messenger before, that is, before it was built — meaning the above- 
mentioned Abu ‘Amir — they will swear: ‘We desired nothing, by building it, but, to do, good’, by way of 
kindness towards the poor in times of [heavy] rain or [extreme] heat and in order to provide [a place of 
worship] for the Muslims; and God bears witness that they are truly liars, in this [claim of theirs]. They 
had asked the Prophet (s) to perform prayers in it, and so the following was revealed: Never dand, [never] perform prayer, there: and so he sent a group of men to destroy and burn 
it, and in its place they left a refuse pit where decaying cadavers would be dumped. A mosque which was 
founded, one whose foundations were built, upon piety from thefird day, constructed the day you ar¬ 
rived in Medina (dar al-hijra ) — this was the mosque of Quba 1 , as mentioned in Bukhari — is worthier, 

17 The dirar mosque, as it is known in the Sira narrative, was built by the ‘hypocrites’ to rival the one built at Quba’, but also for the 
covert purpose of plotting against the Prophet with outside help, principally, that of the mentioned Syrian monk Abu ‘Amir: for a 
detailed account of this episode, see Ibn Kathir, Biddy a, in, 6i8ff.

than that [other one], for you to Hand, to perform prayer, therein; in it are men, namely, the Ansar, who 
love to purify themselves; and God loves those who purify themselves ( muttahhirin : the original ta [of 
mutatahhirun ] has been assimilated with the ta) that is, He will reward them. Ibn Khuzayma 18 reported 
in his Sahih [by way of an isnad] from [‘Uwaym] b. Sa'ida that: 19 ‘The Prophet (s) came to them at the 
mosque of Quba’ and said, “God, exalted be He, has praised handsomely the way you purify yourselves 
in the story about your mosque, so what is this purification which you perform?” They said, “By God, O 
Messenger of God, all that we know is that we used to have Jews in our vicinity and they used to wash 
their behinds after defecation, and so we began to wash in the way they did”’. According to one hadith 
reported by al-Bazzar 20 [they said]: ‘We use atones [to scrape off remnants] and follow this with water’; to 
which he [the Prophet] said, ‘That is the way [for proper purification]. Let this be your way’. Is he who founded his building upon fear of God and, in hope of, beatitude, from Him, better, or 
he who founded his building upon the brink, the edge, of a bank, an overhang, that is crumbling, about 
to collapse (read juruf or jurf) so that it toppled with him, so that it collapsed [taking] with it the one who 
built it, into the fire of Hell?: [this is] an excellent similitude for building upon that which constitutes the 
opposite of fear of God and [for] what it leads to; the interrogative is meant as an affirmative: in other 
words, the former is the better, which is the likeness of the [building of the] mosque of Quba’, while the 
latter is the likeness of the mosque of‘harm’ ( masjid al-dirar). And God guides not the evildoing folk. The buildings which they have built will never cease to be a misgiving, a point of doubt, in their 
hearts unless their hearts are cut, torn, to pieces, such that they die; and God is Knower, of His creatures, 
Wise, in what He does with them.","There are those [hypocrites] who built a mosque to cause harm[80], promote disbelief and create division among the believers, and as a base for those who had previously fought against Allah and His Messenger. They will surely swear, “We intend nothing but good,” but Allah testifies that they are indeed liars. . Never pray therein [O Prophet]. A mosque that was founded on piety[81] from the first day is more deserving for you to pray therein. In it are men who love to keep themselves pure, and Allah loves those who keep themselves pure. . Who is better – one who laid the foundation of his building on piety and seeking Allah’s pleasure; or one who laid the foundation of his building on the edge of a crumbling precipice, so it tumbled down with him into the Fire of Hell? And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. . This building which they built will not cease to be a source of unrest in their hearts until their hearts are cut into pieces. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",[80] The most conniving hypocrites in Madinah built a mosque ‘masjid al-dirār’ (the mosque of harm) to cause dissension and discord among Muslims. .

and those who believe, to ask forgiveness for the idolaters, even though they be kinsmen, relatives, after 
it has become clear to them that they are inhabitants of the Hell-fire, for having died as disbelievers. Abraham’s prayer for the forgiveness of his father was only because of a promise he had made 
to him, when he said to him, I will ask my Lord forgiveness for you [Q. 19:47], in the hope that he would 
submit [to God]; but when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of God, upon his death as an 
disbeliever, he declared himself innocent of him, and refrained from asking forgiveness for him; truly 
Abraham was soft of heart, making frequent entreaty and supplication [to God], forbearing, enduring 
harm patiently. And God would never send a people aStray after He had guided them, to Islam, until He had 
made clear to them that which they should be wary of, in the way of deeds, but when they are not wary 
of it, then they deserve to be sent astray. Surely God is Knower of all things, including who deserves to 
be sent astray, or to be guided. Surely to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth. He gives life and He makes 
to die; and you do not have, O mankind, besides God, that is, other than Him, any protestor, to preserve 
you from Him, or helper, to defend you against His hurt.","It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe to seek forgiveness for the polytheists[83], even if they are close relatives, after becoming clear to them that they are the people of Blazing Fire. . As for the prayer of Abraham for his father’s forgiveness, it was only because of a promise he had made to him. However, when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of Allah, he dissociated himself from him[84]. Indeed, Abraham was tender-hearted and forbearing. . Allah will not cause a people to go astray after He has guided them until He makes clear to them what they should avoid[85]. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of everything. . Indeed, to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth. He gives life and causes death. You have no protector or helper besides Allah.","[83] When Abu Tālib, the Prophet’s uncle, died as a disbeliever, the Prophet (ﷺ) said: “By Allah, I shall keep on asking for forgiveness for you, unless I am told to cease!” Then this verse was revealed. [Al-Bukhārī: 3884, Muslim: 24]. . [84] This prohibition is not exclusive to Islam as it has been in effect since the time of Abraham (عليه السلام) . [85] ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (رضي الله عنهما) reported regarding al-Haruriyah (the kharijites) that the Prophet (ﷺ) said: ""They will go out of Islam as an arrow darts out of the game’s body.""

9,117,121,"God has truly relented, that is, He has [truly] perpetuated His relenting, to the Prophet and the 
Emigrants and the Helpers who followed him in the hour of hardship, that is, during the time of this 
[hardship], which was their predicament during the raid at Tabuk, where two men would share a single 
date, ten men would take turns on one camel, and where the heat became so intense that they resorted 
to drinking filth; after the hearts of a party of them had almost deviated (read either as tazighu or 
yazighu), [had almost] inclined away from following him, in favour of staying behind due to the hard¬ 
ship that afflicfted them, then He relented to them, by making them steadfast. Truly He is Gentle, Merci¬ 
ful to them. And, He relented, to the three who were left behind, [formerly denied] His relenting to them, for 
the same reason [as those mentioned above], when the earth was Straitened for them, for all its breadth, 
that is, despite its vas'tness, so they could find no place wherein to feel secure, and their souls, that is, 
their hearts, were Straitened for them, because of the anxiety and their [sense of] alienation resulting 
from the delay of Gods relenting to them [with mercy], such that they [their souls] could not find happi¬ 
ness or solace; until they thought, they were certain, that (read the softened an) there is no refuge from 
God except in Him. Then He turned [relenting] to them. He made them successful in finding repent¬ 
ance, that they might also turn [in repentance]. Tridy God is the Relenting, the Mercifid. O you who believe, fear God, by refraining from [acfts of] disobedience to Him, and be with 
those who are truthful, in [their] faith and covenants, by adhering to sincerity. It is not for the people of Medina and for the Bedouins [who dwell] around them to Stay behind 
God’s Messenger, when he sets out on a campaign, and to prefer their lives to his life, by guarding them 
against hardships which he [the Prophet] is content [to suffer] himself (this statement is a prohibition 
expressed as a predicate); that, prohibition against staying behind, is because neither thirSt nor toil nor 
hunger afflkls them in the way of God, nor tread they any tread (mawti’an is a verbal noun, meaning 
wat’an ) that enrages the disbelievers, nor gain any gain from the enemy, of God, be it through slaughter, 
capture or plunder, but a righteous deed is therefore recorded for them, that they may be rewarded for it. 
Truly God does not leave the wage of the virtuous to go to waSte, that is, the wage of those [mentioned], 
rather He rewards them. Nor expend they, therein [in the way of God], any sum, small, even if it be a single date, or great, 
nor do they cross a valley, during a [campaign] march, but it is recorded for them, as a righteous deed, 
that God may reward them the beSt of what they used to do, that is, the [due] reward thereof.","Indeed, Allah has turned in mercy to the Prophet, the Emigrants and the Helpers who followed him in the hour of hardship [at Tabūk], after some of them were about to lose heart. Then He turned to them in mercy, for He is All-Gracious, Most Merciful to them. . [And Allah also turned in mercy to] the three who stayed behind[86], until the earth became constrained to them, despite its vastness, and their souls became a burden to them, and they realized that there was no refuge from Allah except in Him. Then He turned to them in mercy, so that they might repent, for Allah is the Accepter of Repentance, the Most Merciful. . O you who believe, fear Allah and be with those who are truthful[87]. . It was not for the people of Madinah and the Bedouins around them to stay behind the Messenger of Allah[88] or to prefer their own lives to his. That is because whenever they suffer any thirst, weariness or hunger in the cause of Allah, or tread a place which enrages the disbelievers, or inflict any loss upon an enemy, a righteous deed is recorded for them. Allah does not let the reward of those who do good to go to waste. . Nor do they spend anything [for Allah’s cause], small or large, or cross a valley, but it is recorded for them, so that Allah may give them the best reward for what they used to do.","[86] Or whose cases were deferred. They were: Ka‘b ibn Mālik, Hilāl ibn ’Umayyah and Murārah ibn al-Rabī‘, who were sincere Companions but failed to join the Messenger’s (ﷺ) campaign in Tabūk Expedition. When he came back, unlike the hypocrites, they told the truth that they had no excuse. So, the Messenger (ﷺ) imposed a ban on them and forbade people to talk to them. This lasted for fifty nights until this verse was revealed. During this time, they endured huge mental anguish for being ostracized by the whole society. [For further details see: Al-Bukhārī: 4418, and Muslim: 2769] . [87] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “...A man speaks the truth and heeds it until he is recorded with Allah as an affirmer of the truth (siddīq)...” [Al-Bukhārī: 6094, Muslim: 2607] . [88] In times of hardship, they should have endured sufferings along with the Prophet (ﷺ) instead of staying behind."

who say, to their companions, mockingly: ‘Which of you has this increased in faith?’, and God says: As 
for those who believe, it has increased them in faith, because they accept that it is true, and they rejoice, 
because of it. But as for those in whose hearts is sickness, a weakness of faith, it only adds abomination to 
their abomination, that is, [it only adds] disbelief to their disbelief, since they disbelieve in it, and they 
die while they were disbelievers. Do they not see, that is, the hypocrites ([in which case] read a-wa-la yarawna; or if read a-wa- 
la tarawna, ‘do you, O believers, not see’) that they are tested, afflided, every year once or twice?, with 
drought and diseases. Still they do not repent, of their hypocrisy, nor do they remember, [nor] do they 
heed admonition. And whenever a sura is revealed, wherein is mention of them, and the Prophet (s) recites it, they 
look at one another, desiring to flee, and saying: ‘Will anyone see you?’, if you get up [and flee] ?, and so 
if no one can see them they get up [and leave], otherwise they stay put. Then they turn away, persist¬

But as for those in whose hearts is sickness, it only increases them in wickedness[91] to their wickedness, and they will die while they are disbelievers. . Do they not see that they are put to trial once or twice every year? Yet they neither repent nor do they take heed. . Whenever a Chapter is revealed, they look at one another [saying], “Is anyone watching you?” Then they slip away[92]. Allah has turned their hearts away because they are a people who do not understand.","[90] They flippantly did so to ridicule the believers. . [91] Lit, ""filth,"" i.e., hypocrisy and disbelief. . [92] They would exchange glances as if saying to one another: “Who is this person who sees you while you plot in secret and tells Muhammad (ﷺ) about it?” Instead of paying heed, they would turn away reverting to their ways."
9,128,129,"Verily there has come to you a messenger from among yourselves, that is, one of you — 
Muhammad (s) — for whom it is grievous, hard, that you should suffer, that is, your suffering, your 
experiencing hardship and encountering harm [is hard on him]; who is full of concern for you, that you 
should be rightly guided; to the believers full of pity, profoundly compassionate, merciful, desiring good 
for them. So if they turn away, [refraining] from believing in you, say: ‘God suffices me. There is no god 
except Him. Upon Him I rely, in Him have I put my truSt, and in none other, and He is the Lord of the 
Tremendous Throne’ (al-’arsh al-azim), the kursi, which is singled out for mention because it is the great¬ 
est of all things created. Al-Hakim reported in al-MuSladrak [by way of an isnad] from Ubayy b. Ka‘b 
that he [Ubayy] said: ‘The laSt verse to be revealed was [from], Verily there has come to you a messenger... 
to the end of the siira’ [sc. Q. 9:128-129].

[10] Yunus 


Meccan, except for verses 40,94,95 and 96, which are Medinese; it consists of 109 or 110 verses, and was 
revealed after [surat] al-Isra. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful: 

[ 10:1] Aliflam ra 3 : God knows bed what He means by these [letters]. Those, namely, these signs, are the 
signs of the wise Book, that is, the Qur’an (the genitive annexation [ayat al-kitab] has the meaning of min 
[sc. min ayati’l-kitab, ‘from among the verses of the Book’]), which has been made clear. 1","There has come to you a Messenger from among yourselves; he is grieved by your suffering, and is concerned for you, and is gracious and merciful towards the believers[93]. . But if they turn away, then say, “Allah is sufficient for me; none has the right to be worshiped except Him[94]; in Him I put my trust, and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne.”","[93] The Messenger (ﷺ) was keen on guiding people and teaching them all that is good, particularly the believers. . [94] The surah ends with a comforting note to the Messenger (ﷺ) in the face of all stiff opposition and resistance, to seek support in Allah and find solace in these words."
10,1,2," Is it for the people, the people of Mecca (this interrogative is meant as a disavowal; the preposition 
[li-, ‘for’] and its dependent genitive noun [al-nas, ‘the people’] constitute a circumstantial qualifier of 
His saying): a wonder (‘ ajaban: read in the accusative as a predicate of kana; or if read in the nominative 
[‘ajabun ] as its subject: its predicate, which is also its subject if read according to the former [accusative] 
reading, is [the following, an awhayna ]) that We have inspired a man from among them, Muhammad 
(s), [saying] (an, ‘that’, is explicative): ‘Warn, threaten, the people, the disbelievers, with chastisement, 
and give good tidings to those who believe that they have a prior, a preceding, [promise of] truth with 
their Lord’?, that is a [preceding] fair reward, in return for the deeds they have sent forward. The dis¬ 
believers say, ‘Truly this, Qur’an that comprises all of that [mentioned], is manifest sorcery’: a variant 
reading [for la-sihrun ] has la-sahirun, ‘a sorcerer’, where it is the Prophet (s) to whom they are referring 
[as being ‘a manifest sorcerer’].","Alif Lām Ra[1]. These are the verses of the Book of wisdom. . Is it surprising to people that We have sent revelation to a man from among themselves to warn people[2] and give glad tidings to those who believe, that they will have a noble position with their Lord? But the disbelievers say, “This man is a clear magician![3]”","[1] See footnote 2:1. . [2] i.e., Quraysh disbelievers.
 [3] They could only rationalize the bewildering effect of the Message by saying that it bewitches people."
10,3,6,"Truly your Lord is God Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, of the days of this 
world, that is, in the same measure [of time], since there was no sun or moon then: had He willed He 
could have created them in an inStant, but the reason for His not having done so is that He wanted to 
teach His creatures to be circumSJjecft; then He presided upon the Throne, a presiding befitting of Him, 
directing affairs, among creatures. There is no (ma min indicates a relative clause) intercessor, to inter¬ 
cede for anyone, save after His permission: a refutation of their saying, ‘The idols intercede for us!’; that. 
Creator and Director, is God, your Lord, so worship Him, affirm His Oneness. Will you not remember? 
(tadhakkaruna : the original ta [of tatadhakkaruna] has been assimilated with the dhcd). To Him, exalted be He, is the return of all of you: God’s promise, in truth (both [wada and 
haqqan] are verbal nouns, and in the accusative because of the verbs implicit in them). Truly He (read 
innahu as a new sentence, or annahu with an implied lam [sc. li-annahu, ‘Because He’] originates crea¬ 
tion, that is. He began it by originating [it], then recreates it, through resurrection, that He may requite, 
reward, those who believe and perform righteous deeds, juStly. And those who disbelieve, for them will 
be a draught of boiling water and a painful chastisement because they disbelieved . 2 He it is Who made the sun a radiance, that is, emitting light, and the moon a light, and deter¬ 
mined it, with re^eCt to its movement, in Stations: 28 stations in 28 nights every month, becoming 
concealed for two nights when a particular month has 30 days, or [concealed] for one night, when it has 
29 days, so that you might know, thereby, the number of the years and the reckoning. God did not create 
that, which is mentioned, save in truth, not in vain, exalted be He above such things. He details (read 
yufassilu or nufassilu, ‘We detail’) the signs for a people who know, who refled:. Truly in the alternation of night and day, in [their] coming and going, increasing and diminish¬ 
ing, and [in] what God has created in the heavens, of angels, sun, moon, dars and other things, and, 
in, the earth, of animals, mountains, seas, rivers, trees, and other things, there are signs, indications of 
His power, exalted be He, for a people who fear. Him, and so believe: He singles these out for mention 
because they are the ones to benefit from them [such signs], 

1 In other words, ‘these verses are from among the verses of the Book’; there is an internal resonance in words with the gloss, 
muhkam, for hakim, since both derive from the same root, but this is lost in the English. 

2 As before, in Q. 6:70, the gloss for hamim is redundant; also redundant in this case is the gloss hi sahahi kufrihim. 


Tafsir al-Jalalayn","Allah is your Lord Who created the heavens and earth in six Days and then rose over the Throne[4], governing all affairs[5]. None can intercede except by His permission[6]. Such is Allah your Lord, so worship Him. Will you not then take heed? . To Him is your return altogether. Allah’s promise will surely come true. He originates the creation then brings it back, so that He may justly reward those who believe and do righteous deeds. But for those who disbelieve, there will be a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment because of their disbelief. . It is He Who made the sun a radiant light[7] and the moon a reflected light[8], and precisely determined its phases, so that you may know the number of years and account [of time][9]. Allah has not created all of this except for a true purpose[10]. He makes the signs clear for people who know. . Indeed, in the alternation of the night and day, and in what Allah has created in the heavens and earth, there are signs[11] for people who fear Him.","[4] See footnote 7:54.
 [5] This is a manifest sign of Allah’s omnipotence, and thus He alone is worthy of worship.
 [6] He is not like any sovereign whose inner circle of close aides and relatives dare to intercede, relying on his need for them. . [7] Diyā’ is glowing with glaring light.
 [8] Nūr is reflected light. [9] It provides concrete signs of Allah’s Lordship.
 [10] The wisdom is to lead people to realize the Oneness of Allah. . [11] These are cosmic signs (āyāt kawniyyah)."
10,7,10,"Truly those who do not expert to encounter Us, through resurrection, and are content with the 
life of this world, instead of [the life] the Hereafter, since they reject [the truth of] it, and feel reassured, 
feel secure, in it, and those who are heedless of Our signs, [of] the proofs of Our Oneness, neglecting to 
ponder them, those, their abode will be the Fire because of what they used to earn, in the way of [practising] 
idolatry and [performing] acts of disobedience. Truly those who believe and perform righteous deeds, their Lord will guide them. He will lead 
them, through their faith, in Him, by appointing for them a light with which they will be able to find 
their way on the Day of Resurrection. Rivers will flow beneath them in the Gardens of Bliss, their prayer therein, their request for what they desire in Paradise will be to say: ‘Glory be to 
You, O God!’, so that, lo!, what they request they find before them; and their greeting, between them, 
therein will be: ‘Peace.’ And their final prayer will be: ‘Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds’.","Those who do not expect to meet Us, and are pleased and content with the life of this world[12], and those who are heedless of Our signs, . their abode will be the Fire, for what they used to earn. . As for those who believe and do righteous deeds[13], their Lord will guide them by virtue of their faith. Rivers will flow beneath them in the Gardens of Bliss. . Their prayer will be, “Glorify be to You, O Allah,” and their greeting will be, “Peace,” and the closing of their prayer will be, “All praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.”",[12] They do not give a second’s thought to resurrection and reckoning; their current life is all that matters to them. . [13] Sincere Faith and good deeds lead to Paradise.
10,11,14,"When the idolaters sought to hasten [their] chastisement, the following was revealed: And if God 
should hasten for mankind evil as they would hasten good, their term [ of life] woidd already have been 
concluded for them (read as the passive, with nominative ajaluhum [sc. la-qudiya ajaluhum ]; or read 
as the active with accusative ajalahum [sc. la-qada ajalahum, ‘He would have already concluded their 
term’]), by His destroying them, but He gives them reSJiite. But We leave those, who do not expeit to 
encounter Us, to wander blindly in their insolence, hesiStant and perplexed. If misfortune, illness or poverty, should befall a, disbelieving, man, he calls upon Us on his side, 
that is, lying down, or sitting or Standing, in other words, in every State; but when We have relieved him 
of his misfortune, he passes on, in his unbelief, as if(ka-an is softened, its subject omitted, in other words 
[read as] ka-annahu ) he had never called upon Us because of a misfortune that befell him. So, in the 
same way that supplication during misfortune and abstention [from supplication] in times of comfort 
were adorned for him, is adorned for the prodigal, the idolaters, that which they do. And indeed We have destroyed generations, communities, before you, O people of Mecca, when 
they did evil, by way of idolatry, and, indeed, their messengers brought them clear proofs, indicating 
their truthfulness; but they woidd not believe ( wa-ma kanu li-yu’minu-. this is a supplement to zalamu, 
‘they did evil’). So, juSt as We destroyed those, We shall requite the sinning, the unbelieving, folk. Then We made you, O people of Mecca, successors (khalaif is the plural of khalifa ) 1 in the earth 
after them, that We might behold how you would behave, in it, and whether you would take heed from 
their example and believe in Our messengers.","If Allah were to hasten evil[14] to the people, just as they seek to hasten good[15], they would have been ruined. But We leave those who do not expect to meet Us to wander blindly in their transgression. . When hardship befalls man, he calls upon Us, whether lying on his side, sitting or standing. But when We remove his hardship, he turns a blind eye as though he had never called upon Us to remove his hardship[16]. This is how the misdeeds of the transgressors are made appealing to them. . We destroyed the generations[17] before you when they indulged in wrongdoing, and their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they would not believe. This is how We recompense the wicked people. . Then We made you their successors in the land to see how you would behave[18].","[14] i.e., invoking against oneself or one’s children in anger.
 [15] “Man prays for evil as he prays for good, for man is ever hasty.” See 17:11. . [16] “When We bestow favor upon man, he turns away and distances himself [from Us]; but when evil touches him, he is full of prolonged supplication.” See 41:51. . [17] i.e., the people of Noah, ‘Ād, Thamūd, the people of Abraham, the dwellers of Midian, and the overturned cities [of Lot]” See 9:70. . [18] The Messenger (ﷺ) said: “Life is alluringly lush green. Allah will make you successors in it to see what you do” [Muslim: 2742]."
10,15,17,"And when Our clear, manifest (bayyinat is a circumstantial qualifier), verses, [from] the Qur’an, 
are recited to them, those who do not expeSt to encounter Us, those who do not fear the Resurrection, 
say, ‘Bring a Qur’an other than this, one in which our gods are not denigrated, or change it’, of your 
own accord. Say, to them: ‘It is not for me to change it of my own accord. I only follow that which is 
revealed to me. Truly I fear, if I should disobey my Lord, by changing it, the chastisement of a dreadful 
day’, that is, the Day of Resurrection. Say: ‘If God had willed I would not have recited it to you, nor would He have made it known to 
you, [nor] would He have made you aware of it (the la [of wa-la adrakum ] is for negation, and is a sup¬ 
plement to what preceded; a variant reading has the lam [sc. la-adrakum, ‘He would have made it known 
to you’] as the response to the [conditional] law, ‘if’, in other words. He would have made it known to you 
by the tongue of someone other than myself). For I have already dwelt among you a [whole] lifetime, of 
forty years, before this [Qur’an], not relating to you anything [of the sort], so will you not understand?’, 

3 The expression khalifa can mean ‘successor’ as well as ‘vicegerent’; but it is clear that the Jalalayn commentary understands this 
instance in the former sense, since the latter implies considerable power and however powerful the Meccans may have been, their 
dominion, in world terms, was surely restricted to Mecca. In any case, the plural khala if, as opposed to khulafa, further supports 
the choice of translating it simply as ‘successors’.

Sura Yunus 


that this [Qur’an] is not from myself? And who, that is, no one, does greater evil than he who invents a lie against God, by ascribing 
a partner to Him, or denies His signs?, [denies] the Qur’an. Surely, it is that, the sinners, the idolaters, 
shall not prosper, they shall [never] find happiness.","When Our verses are recited to them clearly, those who do not expect to meet Us say, “Bring us a different Qur’an, or make changes in it[19].” Say, “It is not for me to change it on my own accord; I only follow what is revealed to me. If I were to disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a momentous Day.” . Say, “If Allah had willed, I would not have recited it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. I have spent a lifetime[20] among you before this. Do you not then understand?” . Who does greater wrong than he who fabricates lies against Allah or rejects His verses? Indeed, the wicked will never succeed.","[19] They hated those parts of the Qur’an that did not conform to their erroneous way of life, such as resurrection. . [20] i.e., forty years before receiving revelation."
10,18,20,"And they worship, besides God, that is, other than Him, that which can neither hurt them, 
should they not worship it, nor profit them, if they do worship it — and these are the idols; and they say, 
of them: ‘These are our intercessors with God’. Say, to them: ‘Would you tell, would you inform, God of 
what He does not know in the heavens or in the earth?’ (the interrogative is meant as a disavowal), for if 
He had a partner. He [Himself] would know it, since nothing can be hidden from Him. Glory be to Him!, 
in [affirmation of] His transcendence, and High be He exalted above what they associate! with Him. Mankind was but one community, following one religion, that is submission [to the One God], 
from the time of Adam to the time of Noah; but it is also said [that this was the case] from the time of 
Abraham to that of 'Amr b. Luhayy; 4 then they differed, some of them remaining firmly [upon belief in 
One God], while others disbelieved. And had it not been for a word that had already preceded from 
your Lord, [to the effecft] that requital would be deferred until the Day of Resurrection, it would have 
been decided between them, that is, [between] mankind, in this life, regarding that over which they dif¬ 
fered, in religion, by the disbelievers being punished. And they, the people of Mecca, say, ‘Why has a sign not been sent down on him, on Muhammad 
( s),from his Lord?’, as was the case with [previous] prophets, in the way of a she-camel, a .Staff or a 
[glowing] hand. 5 Then say, to them: ‘The Unseen, that which is concealed from servants, in other words, 
its affair, belongs only to God, and it is from this [Unseen] that signs come forth; therefore He alone can 
bring them forth: mine is only to covey the Message. So wait, for the chastisement, if you do not believe. 
I am waiting with you’.","They worship besides Allah those who can neither harm nor benefit them, saying, “These are our intercessors with Allah.” Say, “Do you inform Allah of what He does not know in the heavens or on the earth? Glorified and Exalted is He far above what they associate [with Him]!” . The whole of mankind was but a single community, then they differed[21]. If it had not been for a prior decree from your Lord, a decisive judgment would have been passed between them concerning their differences[22]. . They say, “Why has no sign[23] been sent down to him from his Lord?” Say [O Prophet], “The unseen belongs to Allah alone. Wait then; I too am waiting with you.”","[21] Ibn ‘Abbās (رضى الله عنهما) reported: “The time between Adam and Noah was ten centuries. Throughout these, people were on the right path of Allah, but then they started disputing [over matters of Faith, i.e., idol worshiping]. So, Allah sent prophets bearing glad tiding and warning”. [Al-Hākim, Al-Mustadrak: 2:546, cf. Al-Tabarī]
 [22] i.e., not to punish anyone before evidence has come to him, or not to judge between them in this life. . [23] i.e., a miracle."
10,21,23,"And when We made people, that is, the disbelievers of Mecca, fade of mercy, [of] rain and fertil¬ 
ity, after adversity, misery and drought, that had afflided them, behold! they have some plot concern¬ 
ing Our signs, in the way of mockery and denial. Say, to them: ‘God is swifter at plotting, at requiting; 
surely Our, guardian, messengers are writing down that which you are plotting’ ( tamkurun, is also read 
yamkurun, ‘they are plotting’). He it is Who conveys you ( yusayyirukum : a variant reading has yanshurukum ) across the land 
and the sea, until when you are in ships and they sail with them (there is a shift of address from second 
[to third] person) with a fair, gentle, breeze and they rejoice therein, there comes upon them a dormy 
wind, blowing violently, destroying everything, and waves come on them from every side, and they 
think that they are overwhelmed, that is, [that] they shall perish, they call upon God, secure in their 
faith, their supplication, only to Him: ‘If (la-in: the lam is for oaths) You deliver us from these, terrors, 
we shall verily be of the thankfid’, [of those] who affirm [Your] Oneness. Yet when He has delivered them, behold! they are insolent in the earth wrongfully, by associat¬ 
ing others with God. O mankind, your insolence, wrongdoing, is only again d yourselves, since the sin 
thereof shall fall againSt them; it is [but], the enjoyment of the life of this world, which you will enjoy for 
a short while, then to Us is your return, after death, and We shall inform you of what you used to do, and 
then requite you for it (a variant reading [for nominative matau ] has accusative mataa, ‘an enjoyment’, 
in other words [read as with an omitted verb such as] tatamatta‘una, ‘ [one which] you shall enjoy’).","When We give people a taste of mercy after being afflicted with adversity, they start plotting against Our verses. Say, “Allah is swifter in planning [retribution]. Our angel-messengers record whatever you plot.” . It is He Who enables you to travel through the land and sea, until when you are in the ships and they sail with those on board and rejoicing in a favorable wind, then suddenly a stormy wind comes, with waves crashing into them on all sides, and they feel that there is no escape. Then they cry out to Allah[24] with sincere devotion to Him, “If You save us from this, we will surely be among those who are grateful.” . However, when He saves them, they start transgressing in the land unjustly[25]. O people, your transgression is against your own souls. Take your little enjoyment in this life; then to Us is your return, and We will inform you of what you used to do.","[24] The journey of life is vulnerable and precarious, which is analogous to a sea voyage, where people ride and are not sure when the tide will turn against them. It is out of Allah’s grace that keeps them safe from the woes and perils of life. . [25] By disbelief, associating false deities with Allah and committing sins."
10,24,25,"The likeness, the description, of the life of this world is only as water, rain, which We send down

6 The word tilawa can mean ‘to follow’ in general, as well as to follow a text, in other words ‘to read’ or ‘to recite’: in other instances 
in the Qur’an a soul is described as reading its record of deeds [cf. Q. 17:14,17 and Q. 69:19]. Baydawi {Anwar, 1, 343: sub Q. 10:30) 
acknowledges the possibility of it meaning ‘to follow’, in the sense that on the Day of Resurrection every soul will ‘follow’ its deeds, 
which either lead it to Hell or to Paradise.

into error). How then are you turned away, from faith, despite the proofs having been established? Thus, juSt as those are turned away from faith so, the Word of your Lord is justified concerning 
those who are wicked, [those who] disbelieve, and this [Word] is [either] the verse, [Q. 32:13] ‘Verily I 
shall fill Hell [with jinn and mankind, together ]’, 7 or it is [the following:] that they do not believe.","Say, “Who provides for you from the heaven and earth? Or who owns [your] hearing and sight? Who brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living? Who controls all things?” They will say, “Allah[32].” Say, “Do you not then fear Him? . Such is Allah, your True Lord. What is beyond the truth except falsehood? So how could you be averted [from the truth]?” . Thus the decree of your Lord has come true against the wicked, that they will never believe[33].","[32] These are some of the most potent signs of Allah’s Lordship, Who is the sole rightful to worship. . [33] That is the predestined decree that the ardently rebellious will never be guided."
10,34,36,"Say: ‘Is there of those whom you associate [with God] one that originates creation, then recre¬ 
ated it?’ Say: ‘God originates creation, then recreates it. How then are you deviated?’, turned away 
from worshipping Him, despite proof having been established. Say: ‘Is there of those whom you associate [with God] one that guides to the truth?’, by [means 
of] setting up [definitive] arguments and creating guidance. Say: ‘God guides to the truth; is One Who 
guides to the truth — and this is God — more deserving of being followed, or one who does not guide, 
[one who] is not [himself] guided, unless he is guided?, more deserving of being followed? (the inter¬ 
rogative is meant as an affirmation and a rebuke, in other words, the former is more deserving). So what 
is wrong with you, how do you judge?’, [how do you make] this corrupt judgement, one where what 
does not deserve to be followed is followed? And moft of them, in worshipping idols, follow nothing but conjecture, since they imitate their 
fathers therein; truly conjecture avails nothing againCt truth, when what is sought is knowledge. Surely 
God is Knower of what they do, and will requite them for it.","Say, “Can any of your [so-called] partners originate creation and then repeat it[34]?” Say, “Allah originates creation and then repeats it. How are you then deluded [from the truth]?” . Say, “Can any of your [so-called] partners guide to the truth[35]?” Say, “Allah guides to the truth.” Who is then more worthy to be followed: the One Who guides to the truth, or he who has no guidance unless he himself is guided? What is the matter with you, that you judge so[36]? . Most of them follow nothing but assumptions. However, assumptions are of no avail against the truth. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of what they do.","[34] It proves utter inability and unworthiness of false gods to worship. . [35] Failure of idols is further exposed that they are unable to guide to the straight path.

10,37,44,"And this Qur’an is not such as could ever be produced, that is, [it could not be] a fabrication, [by 
anyone] besides God; but it is, revealed [as], a confirmation of what is before it, of Scriptures, and a de¬ 
tailing of the Book, a exposition of the rulings and other matters which God has prescribed — wherein is 
no doubt, no uncertainty —from the Lord of the Worlds ( min rabbi’l-’alamin is semantically connected 
to tasdiqa, ‘a confirmation, or to an omitted unzila, ‘revealed’; a variant reading [for accusative tasdiqa] 
has the nominative tasdiqu and nominative tafsilu, ‘a detailing’, [for the accusative tafsila ] by [reading] 
an implied huwa, ‘it is’). Or do they say, ‘He has invented it’?, Muhammad (s) has invented it. Say: ‘Then bring a sura 
like it, in terms of the clarity and the rhetorical excellence of its language, by way of invention, for you 
are eloquent ^eakers of Arabic like me; and call upon whom you can, for help in this [matter], besides 
God, that is, other than Him, if you are truthful’, in [saying] that this is an invention. But they were not 
able to do this. God, exalted be He, says: Nay, but they denied that, the knowledge whereof they did not com¬ 
prehend, that is, [they denied] the Qur’an and did not reflected upon it; and whereof the interpretation, 
the consequence of the threats [made] therein, has not yet come to them. So, in the same [manner of] 
denial, those who were before them denied, their messengers. Behold then what was the consequence 
for the evildoers!, for denying the messengers, in other words, [behold] how their affair was concluded, 
by their being destroyed. In a similar manner, We shall destroy these [people]. And of them, that is, [of] the people of Mecca, are some who believe in it, God being aware of 
this in their case, and some who would never believe therein. And your Lord knows very well the cor¬ 
rupters-. this is a threat for them. If they deny you, then say, to them: ‘Unto me is my work, and to you your work, that is, for each 
there will be a [due] requital of his deeds; you are innocent of what I do, and I am innocent of what you 
do’-, this was abrogated by the ‘sword’ verse [Q. 9:5]. And of them are some who listen to you, when you recite the Qur’an. But will you make the 
deaf to hear — He likens them [the Meccan disbelievers] to these [the deaf] because they are not able to 
benefit from what is recited to them — even though, with their deafness, they do not understand?, [even 
though they do not] reflecft?

not see? — He likens them [the Meccan disbelievers] to these [the blind] because they fail to be guided, 
nay, [they are] much worse [since God says]: It is not the eyes that are blind, but blind are the hearts within 
the breasts [Q. 22:46]. Verily God does not wrong mankind in any way, but mankind wrong themselves.","This Qur’an could not possibly have been produced by anyone other than Allah. It is a confirmation of what came before it and an explanation of the Scripture and is undoubtedly from the Lord of the worlds. . Or do they say, “He fabricated it?” Say, “Produce then one chapter like it[37], and call upon whoever you can other than Allah, if you are truthful!” . But they rejected that which they did not comprehend, and its warning has not yet been fulfilled against them. Similarly, those who came before them refused to believe. Then see how was the end of the wrongdoers! . There are some among them who will believe in it and others will not. And your Lord knows best those who spread corruption. . If they reject you, then say, “My deeds are mine and your deeds are yours[38]. You are not responsible for what I do, nor am I responsible for what you do.” . Among them are some who listen to you, but can you make the deaf hear, even though they have no understanding? . And among them are some who look at you, but can you guide the blind even though they have no sight[39]? . Allah does not wrong people in the least, but it is people who wrong themselves.","[37] “Say: “If all humans and jinn were to come together to produce something similar to this Qur’an, they would not be able to produce the like of it, even if they collaborated with one another.” See 17:88. .

10,45,53,"And on the day when He shall gather them, it is, as if they had not tarried, in this world, or in 
the grave, but an hour of the day, because of the terror of what they see (the comparative sentence is a 
circumstantial qualifier referring to the [third person] pronoun); recognising one another, knowing one 
another, upon their being resurrected, but thereafter the recognition ceases on account of the severity of 
the terrors (the [laSt] sentence is either an implied circumstantial qualifier or one connected to the ad¬ 
verbial qualifier [yawma, ‘on the day’]); those will verily have loft who denied the encounter with God, 
through resurrection, for they were not guided. And whether ( wa-imma: the nun of the conditional particle in has been assimiliated with the 
extra ma) We show you something of that which We promise them, of chastisement, during your lifetime

dhaka, ‘then so shall it be’), 8 or We take you [to Us], before punishing them, to Us they shall return, and 
God, moreover, is Witness, Aware, of what they do, in the way of their denials and disbelief, and so will 
chaStise them with the severest punishment. And for every community, of the communities [of this world], there is a messenger. And when 
their messenger comes, to them, and they deny him, judgement is passed between them juflly, fairly, 
such that they are punished and the messenger, and all those who accepted his truthfulness, are deliv¬ 
ered; and they are not wronged, by being punished for no crime: similarly, We shall deal with these 
[disbelievers of your community]. And they say: ‘When will this promise, of chastisement, come to pass, if you are truthful, about it?’ Say: ‘I have no power to, avert, hurt, from, myself, or to, bring, benefit, except as God might 
will, to give me power over: so how could I possess the power to bring about the chastisement? For every 
community there is an appointed time, a fixed period until they perish. When their time comes, they 
cannot put it off, they will not miss it, by a single hour, nor bring it forward, [nor] overtake it’. Say: ‘Have you considered?, [Say] inform me: If His, God’s, chastisement comes upon you by 
night or day, what, part, is there of it, that is, [of] the chastisement, that the sinners, the idolaters, seek to 
haften? {an overt noun [al-mujrimun, ‘the sinners’] has replaced the [second person, ‘you’] pronominali- 
sation. The interrogative sentence is the response to the conditional, as [in the case where] you might say, 
‘If I come to you, what would you give me?’; the intention here is to provoke terror [in them], in other 
words: how awful is that which they seek to haSten!) Is it [only] then, when it has come to pass, [when] it has befallen you, that you will believe 
therein?, that is, in God, or [it means] in the chastisement, when it has come down (the [use of] hamza 
[in a-thumma, ‘is it then] is to deny [the possibility of] deferment [of chastisement], in other words, 
it [your belief] will not be accepted from you [in that instance] and it will be said to you: Now, do you 
believe, when [until now] you have been hastening it on?’, in mockery [of it]. 

[ 10:5 2] Then will it be said to those who were evildoers: ‘Tafte the everlasting chastisement!, that is, the 
one in which you shall abide. Are you, you are not, requited for anything but, the requital of, what you 
used to earn?’ 

8 The Arabic imma allows for both the English ‘if’ and ‘whether’, but the grammatical comment to the effect that the response to the 
conditional would be ‘so be it’ would require that the English be ‘if’: ‘If We show you something of that which We promise them, 
then so be it’. However, in order for the English translation of the Qur’an to make sense, it is beS to compromise by translating the 
Arabic as ‘whether’.

Sura Yunus  And they ask you to tell, to inform, them, ‘Is it true?’, that which you promise us in the way of 
chastisement and resurrection? Say: ‘Aye, indeed, by my Lord! Verily it is true and you cannot escape’, 
[you cannot] elude the chastisement.","On the Day when He will gather them, it will be as if they had not stayed [in this world] except for an hour of a day, they will recognize one another[40]. Those who denied the meeting of Allah will be losers, for they did not follow guidance. . Whether We show you [O Prophet] some of that [punishment] of which We warn them, or We cause you to die, to Us is their return, and Allah is a Witness to all what they do. . For every people there is a messenger. When their messenger comes, it will be judged[41] between them with justice, and they will not be wronged. . They say, “When will this warning[42] come to pass, if you are truthful?” . Say, “I have no power to harm or benefit myself, except by the Will of Allah.” For every people there is an appointed term; when their time comes, they can neither delay it for a moment nor can they bring it forward. . Say, “What do you think, if His punishment were to overtake you by night or by day, what part of it would the wicked seek to hasten[43]? . Will you believe in it only after it befalls you[44]? Now! While you used to seek its hastening[45]?” . Then the wrongdoers will be told, “Taste the everlasting punishment! Are you being recompensed except for what you used to earn?” . They ask you, “Is it true?” Say, “Yes, by my Lord. It is certainly true, and you cannot escape it.”","[40] Only then they will realize their fatal error, and their interaction will only be one of mutual reproach. .

[their remorse] secret from the weak ones whom they had led aStray, fearing reproach, but it has been 
decided juStly between them, [between] all creatures, and they are not wronged, in anything. Why, surely to God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Why, surely God’s promise, 
of resurrection and requital, is true, [is] fixed, but moSt of them, people, do not know, this. He gives life and makes to die, and to Him you shall be returned, in the Hereafter, and He shall 
requite you for your deeds.","If every wrongdoer were to possess all that is on earth, he would surely offer it to ransom himself. They will hide their remorse[46] when they see the punishment.

No! Or do you, nay [you], invent lies concerning God?’, by attributing that to Him. And what do they suppose, those who invent lies concerning God, [will happen to them] on 
the Day of Resurrection?: do they reckon that He will not chastise them? No! Truly God is Bountiful

Tafsir al-Jalalayn Why, surely to God belongs all who are in the heavens and all who are in the earth, as servants,

Him, idols, are not following associates, of His, in reality, exalted be He above this: they are following 
nothing but conjecture, in this [matter], that is, their supposition that these are gods who intercede for 
them, and they are only telling lies, in this [matter], He it is Who made for you the night that you should red therein, and the day to see: the attribu¬ 
tion of sight ( ibsar ) to ‘the day is figurative, since one is able to see during it. Surely in that are signs, 
indications of His Oneness, exalted be He, for a folk who are able to hear, hearing [in such a way so as] 
to reflecft and be admonished. I 7 i ey, that is, the Jews and the Christians, and those who claim that the angels are the daughters 
of God, say, ‘God has taken [to Him] a son’. God, exalted be He, says to them: Glory be to Him!, [in af¬ 
firmation of] His transcending having offering. He is Independent, [without need] of anyone, for only 
he who has need of a child would desire [to have] one. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all 
that is in the earth, as possessions, creatures and servants. You have no warrant, [no] proof, for this, that 
you say. Do you say about God what you do not know? (an interrogative meant as a rebuke). Say: ‘Truly those who invent lies concerning God, by attributing offering to Him, shall not 
prosper’, they shall not find happiness. Theirs will be, enjoyment, [only] a little, in this world, which they will enjoy for the duration of 
their lives, then to Us is their return, at death, then We shall make them tafte terrible chastisement, after 
death, because they used to disbelieve.","Do not let their words grieve you. Indeed, all power belongs to Allah. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. .

10,71,73,"And recite, O Muhammad (s), to them, that is, [to] the Meccan disbelievers, the Story, the tale, 
of Noah ( Nuhin is substituted by [the following, idh qdla] ) when he said to his people, ‘O my people, if 
my sojourn, my Stay among you, is too great [to bear], is a hardship, for you, as is my reminding you, 
my admonishing you, by the signs of God, in God have I put my truSt; so decide upon your course of 
adion, resolve upon what you will do to me, together with your associates ( wa-shurakaakum: the waw 
[wa-] means here ‘with’), then let not your decision be a secret between you, concealed, nay, manifest it 
and proclaim it to me; then implement it againSt me, carry out what you desire, and do not put it off, [do 
not] give me reSJiite, for I am not concerned by you. But if you turn away, from my reminding [you], I have not asked you for any wage, any reward 
for it, so turn [and go] away: my wage, my reward, falls only on God, and I have been commanded to be 
of those who submit [ to God]’. But they denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the Ark, and made them, that is, 
those with him, successors, in the earth, and We drowned those who denied Our signs, by [unleashing] 
the Flood. Behold then the nature of the consequence for those who had been warned!, in that they were 
destroyed: likewise We deal with those who deny.","Relate to them the story of Noah when he said to his people, “O my People, if my presence among you and my reminding you of Allah’s signs have become unbearable to you, then in Allah I have put my trust. So gather all your schemes, you and your [so-called] partners, leaving no room for uncertainty, then carry it out against me, and give me no respite[53]. . But if you turn away, then I have not asked you for any reward. My reward is only with Allah, and I have been commanded to be among those who submit to Allah [as Muslims].” . But they rejected him, so We saved him and those who were with him in the Ark, and made them successors[54], and We drowned those who rejected Our signs. Then see how was the end of those who were warned.","[53] Prophet Noah’s (عليه السلام) mission lasted for 950 long years of argumentation with his people and is described in much detail in the Qur’an: “They said: “O Noah, you have argued with us and argued much, so bring us what you have promised us if you are telling the truth!” (11:32); “They said: “If you cease not, O Noah, you will indeed be among the stoned!” (26:116). He finally challenged them in a manner fully trusting in Allah that no one could cause him harm unless Allah willed it so. . [54] Allah Almighty made the people who followed Noah the ones whose posterity was to last in the land."

Hud and Salih, and they brought them clear proofs, miracles, but it was not for them to believe in that 
which they had denied before, that is, before the sending of messengers to them. Thus do We seal. Stamp

So when the truth came to them from Us, they said, “This is indeed a clear magic!” . Moses said, “Do you say this about the truth after it has come to you? Can this be magic? But magicians will never succeed.” . They said, “Have you come to turn us away from what we found our forefathers following, so that you two might become supreme in the land?

promises, however much the sinners be averse’. But with Moses, none believed save a few descendants, a party, of, the children of, his, that is, 
Pharaoh’s, folk, out of fear of Pharaoh and their council, that he [Pharaoh] might persecute them, turn 
them away from his [Moses’s] religion by torturing them; and truly Pharaoh was despotic, arrogant, in 
the land, the land of Egypt, and truly he was of the prodigal, [of] those who transgress the bounds by 
claiming to be Lords. And Moses said, ‘O my people, if you have believed in God then put your truft in Him, if you 
have [truly] submitted [to Him]’. Sotheysaid, ‘In God we have put our truft. Our Lord, make us not a [cause of] temptation for 
the evildoing folk, that is, do not make them prevail over us, leSt they then think that they are upon the 
right path and so end up succumbing to [the] temptation [of thinking that they are upon the right path] 
because of us; and deliver us by Your mercy from the unbelieving folk’.","Pharaoh said, “Bring me all learned magicians.” . When the magicians came, Moses said to them, “Cast whatever you have to cast.” . When they did, Moses said, “All what you have brought is mere magic; Allah will surely make it useless, for Allah does not let the work of the mischief-makers thrive. . And Allah establishes the truth by His Words, even though the wicked abhor it.” . But none believed in Moses except some youth of his own people, despite their fear that Pharaoh and their own chiefs might persecute them[57]. Pharaoh was indeed a tyrant in the land and he was truly one of the transgressors. . Moses said, “O my people, if you have faith in Allah, then put your trust in Him, if you have truly submitted.” . They said, “In Allah we put our trust. Our Lord, do not subject us to the persecution of the oppressive people[58], . and save us by Your mercy from the disbelieving people.”","[57] i.e., to drive them away from following the truth by inflicting hardship on them. . [58] By overpowering them and making them revert from the right path to disbelief."
10,87,89,"And We inspired Moses and his brother [saying]: ‘Appoint houses for your people in Egypt and 
make your houses oratories, places in which to perform prayers, so that you might be secure from fear 
— for Pharaoh had prohibited them from performing prayers — and establish, fulfil, worship; and give 
good tidings to the believers’, of vicftory and Paradise. And Moses said, ‘Our Lord, You have indeed given Pharaoh and his council Tplendour and 
riches in the life of this world. Our Lord, You have given them this, that they may lead [people] aftray, 
as a consequence thereof, from Your way, [from] Your religion. Our Lord, obliterate, transform, their 
riches and harden their hearts, it amp upon them and shackle [them], so that they do not believe until 
they see the painful chastisement’: he [Moses] invoked God against them and Aaron said ‘Amen at the 
end of his invocation. He, [God] exalted be He, said, ‘Your prayer has been answered : thus their riches were trans¬ 
formed into atones and Pharaoh did not believe until he was about to drown. So the two of you remain 
upright, with the Message and the Call until such time as chastisement befalls them, and do not follow

grammatical understanding and rendition of this part of the verse, but since it is given as the variant in the Jalalayn commentary, 
the alternative rendition — using two interrogatives — has been adopted in the above translation.

the way of those who have no knowledge’, when they seek to hasten on My judgement — it is reported 
that he [Moses] remained [alive] a further forty years thereafter.","We inspired Moses and his brother, “Provide houses for your people in Egypt, and make your houses face the qiblah direction, establish prayer, and give glad tidings to the believers.” . Moses said, “Our Lord, You have given Pharaoh and his chiefs splendor and wealth in the life of this world. Our Lord, they may lead people astray from Your way. Our Lord, destroy their wealth and harden their hearts[59], so that they may not believe until they see the painful punishment.” . Allah said [to Moses and Aaron], “Your prayer is answered, so be steadfast on the straight path, and do not follow the way of those who do not know.”","[59] Moses did the same as Noah (عليه السلام) did when Allah told him that none of his people will believe besides those who already did so (cf. 11:36), so he prayed for them to be utterly wiped out (cf. 71:27)."
10,90,93,"And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea; and Pharaoh pursued them, he caught up 
with them, together with his hoSts, in insolence and transgression (baghyan wa-’adwan: these constitute 
the [direcft] objed denoting reason), until, when the [fate of] drowning overtook him, he said, ‘I believe 
that ( annahu is [to be understood as] bi-annahu; a variant reading has innahu, ‘truly it is ..indicating a

it was not; and Gabriel thruSt mud from the sea into his mouth, leSt [God’s] mercy embrace him. And 
he [Gabriel] said to him: ‘Now, do you believe, when hitherto you have disobeyed and been of those who do corruption?, 
on account of your being aStray and your leading [others] aStray, away from belief. But this day We shall save you. We shall bring you out of the sea, in your body, your lifeless 
corpse, that you may be, for those after you a sign, a lesson, that they might come to know your ser¬ 
vitude and not venture upon deeds like yours. According to Ibn ‘Abbas, some of the Children of Israel 
doubted his death and so he was brought out [of the sea] for them to see. And truly moil people, that is, 
the people of Mecca, are heedless of Our signs’, not learning the lesson therefrom. And verily We appointed for the Children of Israel an excellent abode, a noble [place of] resi¬ 
dence, namely, Syria and Egypt, and We provided them with good things; and they did not differ, such 
that some believed while others disbelieved, until the knowledge came to them. Tridy your Lord will 
judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ.","We led the Children of Israel across the sea, then Pharaoh and his soldiers pursued them out of transgression and tyranny, until when he was drowning, he said, “I believe that none has the right to be worshiped except He in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am one of those who submit to Allah.” . [He was told], “Now [you believe]? You had always been disobedient, and were one of the mischief-makers! . So today We will preserve your body, so that you will be an example[60] for those who come after you, yet most people are heedless of Our signs.” . We settled the Children of Israel in a blessed land and provided good things for their sustenance[61]. They did not differ until after knowledge had come to them[62]. Your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.","[60] i.e., his dead body will be preserved, so that people could see that he had actually died and a lesson for later generations. .

10,94,97,"So, if you, O Muhammad (s), are in doubt concerning what We have revealed to you, of stories 
— hypothetically peaking — then question those who read the Scripture, the Torah, before you, for it 
is confirmed [therein] with them and they can inform you of its truth. The Prophet (s) said, ‘I have no 
doubt, nor will I question’. Verily the Truth from your Lord has come to you; so do not be of the waver- 
ers, [of] those who have doubts about it. And do not be of those who deny God’s signs and so be of the losers. Truly those again it whom your Lord’s Word, of chastisement, is justified, [against whom] it is 
due, will not believe, though every sign come to them, until they see the painful chastisement, at which time it [their 
belief] will be of no use to them.","If you are in doubt about what We have sent down to you [O Prophet], then ask those who read the Scripture[63] before you. The truth has surely come to you from your Lord, so never be of those who doubt, . and never be of those who reject the signs of Allah, for then you would be among the losers. . Indeed, those upon whom the decree of Allah is passed will not believe[64], . even if every sign were to come to them until they see the painful punishment.","[63] i.e., the Torah and the Gospel. .

10,98,103,"If only there had been one town — meaning its inhabitants — that believed, before chastisement 
befell it, and profited by its belief — except for the people of Jonah: when they believed, after seeing a 
portent of the chastisement, for they did not wait [to believe] until it came to pass, We removed from 
upon them the chastisement of degradation in the life of this world and We gave them comfort for a 
while, until the conclusion of their terms [of life]. And if your Lord willed, all who are in the earth would have believed together. Would you then 
compel people, to do what God did not will that they do, until they are believers? No! And it is not for any soul to believe save by the permission of God, by His will, and He causes 
abomination, chastisement, to fall upon those who have no understanding, [those who do not] reflect 
upon God’s signs. Say, to the disbelievers of Mecca: ‘Behold what is in the heavens and in the earth!’, of signs 
indicating God’s Oneness, exalted be He. But signs and warners (nudhur is the plural of nadhir, that

before them?, of communities, that is, the like of chastisements that befell them. Say: ‘Then await, this: 
I shall indeed be with you among the waiting’. I 7 i en We shall deliver ( nunajji: the imperfecft tense is [being used] to narrate a pa St situation) 
Our messengers and the believers, from the chastisement. In like manner, to [that] deliverance, it is 
incumbent upon Us to deliver the believers, the Prophet (s) and his Companions, when [the time comes 
for] chaStising the idolaters.","There had never been any town that believed [after seeing the punishment] and benefited from its faith except the people of Jonah[65]. When they believed, We removed from them the punishment of disgrace in the life of this world, and let them enjoy themselves for a while. . Had your Lord willed, all those on earth would have believed altogether. Will you then compel people to become believers? . No soul can believe except by Allah’s will, and He will bring disgrace upon those who do not use their intellect. . Say, “Look at what is in the heavens and earth.” But the signs and warnings are of no avail to those who do not believe. . Are they waiting except for the same punishment that befell those who came before them? Say, “Then wait. I too am waiting with you.” . Then We will save Our messengers and those who believe. For We took it upon Us to save the believers.",[65] An exception to this law was given to the people of Jonah (عليه السلام); their sincere faith delivered them at the very last moment.

is true, then [know that] I do not worship those whom you worship besides God, that is, [worshipping] 
other than Him — namely, idols — for you have doubts concerning God; but I worship God Who will 
take you to Him, [Who] will seize your souls, and I have been commanded to be of the believers. And, it has been said to me: “Set your purpose for religion, as a hanif inclining towards it, and 
do not be of the idolaters; and do not call upon, [do not] worship, besides God, that which can neither profit you, should 
you worship it, nor hurt you, should you not worship it; for if you do, this, hypothetically Sneaking, then

bounty, that [bounty] which He has intended for you. He strikes with it, that is, with [such] good, whom¬

is guided, is guided only for the sake of his own soul, since the reward of his being guided will be his, and 
whoever errs, errs only again ft it, since the evil consequence of his erring shall befall [only] it [his soul].

through reference to Tabari’s comments on this verse (see Jami', VII.i, 238, sub Q. 11:5): it is said that certain individuals avoided 
relieving themselves outdoors, as well as engaging in sexual intercourse unless fully dressed, for they feared that their private parts

Will you not then take heed?","[10] That Allah has a child or associate, or ascribed the Qur’an to the Prophet (ﷺ), or claiming prophethood for themselves.
 [11] On the Day of Judgment.
 [12] i.e., the Prophets, the angels and the believers. . [13] i.e., they refused to listen to the truth or perceive it."
11,25,31,"And verily We sent Noah to his people [and he said]: ‘I am (anni: a variant reading has inni, in 
which case ‘he said’ has been omitted ) 3 for you a clear Warner, one whose warning is plain. That, you worship none but God. Loi I fear for you, should you worship other than Him, the 
chastisement of a painful day’, painful in this world and in the Hereafter. The council, the remedied elders, of his people who disbelieved, said: ‘We see you but a mortal 
like us, and you have no merit over us, and we see not that any follow you save the vileSt among us, 
the riffraff among us, such as the weavers and the shoemakers, [through] rash opinion (badiya’l-ra’ya : 
read with hamza or without [in both cases]), 4 in other words, impulsively, without thinking you over (it 
[badiya’l-ra’ya] is in the accusative because it is an adverbial clause, that is to say: at the time that their 
opinion fir£t came into being). We do not see that you have any merit over us, for which you would de¬ 
serve our following you; nay, we deem you liars’, with regard to your claim to [be bringing] a Message: 
they [the disbelievers] included his folk with him in their address [to him]. He said, ‘O my people, have you considered: — inform me — if I am [ading] upon a clear proof, 
a clear statement, from my Lord and He has given me mercy — prophethood — from Him, and it has 
been obscured, concealed, from you (' amiyat, ‘obscured’, a variant reading has the passive ‘ummiyat), can 
we compel you to it, are we [able] to force you to accept it, while you are averse to it? We are not able to 
do that. And O my people, I do notask of you any wealth, which you should give me, for this, for convey¬ 
ing the Message. My wage, my reward, falls only upon God and I will not drive away those who believe, 

3 The difference — which cannot be shown in translation — between reading anni or inni is that with the latter, qala, ‘he said’, 
is necessarily implied. Whereas the former is equivalent to the English conjunctive ‘that’ in indirect (reported) Speech, the latter 
marks the beginning of a Statement of direct Speech.

Qiraat, 332).

Sura Hud 


as you have commanded me; they shall surely meet their Lord, at the Resurrection, and He will requite 
them and exaCt vengeance for them from those who wronged them and drove them away. But I see you 
are a people who are ignorant, of the consequence of your affair. And O my people, who would help, [who would] defend, me against God, that is, [against] His 
chastisement, if I drive them away?, in other words, there is none to help me. Will you not then remem¬ 
ber? (tadhakkarun : the original second ta [in tatadhakkarun] has been assimilated with the dhal), [will 
you not then] be admonished? And I do not say to you, “I possess the treasure houses of God” nor, “I have knowledge of the 
Unseen”; nor do I say, “I am an angel”, nay, I am human like you. Nor do I say to those whom your eyes 
scorn that God will not give them any good — God knows be it what is in their souls, [in] their hearts. 
Lol if I were to say this, then indeed I woidd be of the evildoers’.","We sent Noah to his people [and he said], “I am indeed a clear warner to you, . that you worship none except Allah. I truly fear for you the punishment of a painful Day[14].” . But the chiefs of his people who disbelieved said, “We only see you as a human being like ourselves, and we do not see those who follow you except the lowest among us apparently. We do not see you superior to us, rather, we think that you are liars.” . He said, “O my people, what do you think, if I should have a clear proof from my Lord, and He has bestowed mercy upon me from Himself, but you fail to see it, can we force you to accept it despite your aversion to it? . O my people, I do not ask you for any wealth in return for it; my reward is only with Allah. I will not dismiss those who believe[15]; they will surely meet their Lord, but I see that you are ignorant people. . O my people, who would protect me from Allah if I were to dismiss them? Will you not then take heed? . I do not tell you that I have Allah’s treasures or that I know the unseen, nor do I say that I am an angel. Nor do I say about those whom you look down upon, that Allah will never grant them any good, for Allah knows best what is in their hearts. If I did so, I would surely be one of the wrongdoers.”","[14] i.e., the Day of Judgment. . [15] The upper echelons of society, out of sheer egotism, despised the underprivileged believers and asked Prophet Noah (عليه السلام) to dismiss them, as happened with Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) too."
11,32,35,"They said, ‘O Noah, you have disputed with us and disputed with us at length, so bring upon us 
that wherewith you are threatening us, in the way of chastisement, if you are of the truthfid’. He said, ‘Only God will bring it upon you, if He wills, to haSten it on for you, for the decision is 
His, not mine; and you cannot escape Him, elude God. And my counsel will not benefit you if I desire to counsel you when God desires to keep you 
aStray (the response to the conditional is indicated by wa-la yanfa’ukum nushi, ‘and my counsel will not 
benefit you’). He is your Lord and to Him you will be brought back’. God, exalted be He, says: Or do they, the disbelievers of Mecca, say, ‘He has invented it’?, 
Muhammad (s) has invented the Qur’an? Say: ‘If I have invented it, then my crime will be upon me, my 
sin [will be upon me], that is, the punishment for it; and I am innocent of what you commit’, of crime, 
when you attribute invention to me.","They said, “O Noah, you have argued far too much with us, so bring what you are threatening us with, if you are one of the truthful.” . He said, “It is only Allah Who can bring it upon you if He wills, then you will have no escape. . Nor will my advice benefit you – no matter how hard I try – if Allah wills to leave you astray. He is your Lord, and to Him you will be returned.” . Or do they say that he has fabricated it”? Say [O Prophet], “If I did fabricate it, then I am responsible for my sin, but I am innocent of the sins you commit.”",
11,36,37,"And it was revealed to Noah that: ‘None of your people will believe except he who has already 
believed. Do not be distressed, grieved, because of what they do, in the way of idolatry. So, he [Noah] 
invoked God againSt them with the words: My Lord, leave not [one of the disbelievers] upon the earth [Q. 
71:26]. God responded to this invocation of his and said: Build the Ark, the ship, under Our eyes, under Our watch and protection, and by Our inspira¬ 
tion, [by] Our command, and do not address Me concerning those who have done evil, [those who] 
have disbelieved, [by asking] that I should refrain from destroying them; lo! they shall be drowned’.","It was revealed to Noah, “None of your people will ever believe except those who have already believed. So do not grieve over what they do[16]. . Construct the Ark under Our [watchful] Eyes[17] and Our direction, and do not plead with Me for those who did wrong, for they will surely be drowned.”","[16] i.e., rejecting the message and mockery. . [17] Being seen, cared for and protected by Allah Almighty."
11,38,40,"And he was building the Ark ( yasna is narrating a paSt State [in the present tense]) and when¬ 
ever a council, a group, of his people passed him, they scoffed at him, mocked him. He said, ‘Though 
you scoff at us, yet we scoff at you, even as you scoff, when we are saved, while you drown; and you shall know to whom ( man introduces the relative clause which constitutes the direct 
object of the [action of] ‘knowing’) will come a chastisement degrading him, and upon whom an endur¬ 
ing, an everlasting, chastisement will fall’. Such that when ( hatta represents the objective for [the acftion of] ‘building’) Our command 
came, for their destruction, and the, baker’s, oven gushed forth , 5 with water — this was the sign for 
Noah — We said, ‘Load therein, in the ship, of every kind, [of every] male and female, that is, of every 
Species of these two, two, a male and a female ( ithnayn constitutes the direct object). According to the 
Story, God gathered for Noah all the beaSts of prey and birds and other [animals]; he [Noah] would go 
through every Species [to selecft them] with his hands, and his right hand would fall upon a male and the 
left upon a female, whereupon he would take them aboard the ship; and your family — that is, his wife 

5 For the significance of the ‘baker’s oven’ — it is said that Noah was born at the source of the Sjaring from which the water of the 
oven welled up and the Flood issued forth — see J.W. Meri, trans., A Lonely Wayfarer’s Guide to Pilgrimage: 'Alt ibn Abl Bakr al-

and children — save those again ft whom the Word has already gone forth, from among them, that they 
be destroyed: this was his wife and his son Canaan, in contract with Shem, Ham and Japheth, whom he 
took aboard together with their three wives, and those who believe’. And none but a few believed with 
him: it is said that these were six men and their wives; it is also said that the number of all those aboard 
the ship was eighty, half of whom were men and the other half, women.","So he started constructing the Ark, and every time some chiefs of his people passed by him, they ridiculed him. He said, “If you ridicule us now, we will soon ridicule you as you are ridiculing us. . You will come to know who will be afflicted with a disgracing punishment[18], and upon whom will descend an everlasting punishment[19].” . When Our command came and the oven overflowed, We said, “Take on board a pair from every species and your family[20] – except those who have already been decreed [to drown][21] – and those who believe.” But none believed with him except a few.","[18] In this life.
 [19] In the Hereafter. . [20] i.e., Noah’s family. [21] Such as his son."
11,41,44,"And he, Noah, said, ‘Embark therein! In the Name of God be its course and its mooring (read 
majrdha and marsdhd , 6 or mujraha and mursdhd, both being verbal nouns, meaning, the length of its 
course and where it docks, in other words, the entire journey). Truly my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful’, 
for He did not destroy us. And it sailed with them amid waves like mountains, in terms of their height and size, and Noah 
called out to his son, Canaan, who was Standing away, from the ship, ‘O my son, embark with us and 
do not be with the disbelievers!’ He said, ‘I shall take refuge in a mountain that will protect me, preserve me, from the water’. 
Said he, ‘This day there is none that can protest from God’s command, [from] His chastisement, except 

— but — him on whom He, God, has mercy’, he will be protected. God, exalted be He, says: And the 
waves came between them, so he was among the drowned. And it was said, ‘O earth, swallow your waters, that have Sprung forth from you — and it rea¬ 
bsorbed it [all] except for what came down from the sky and formed rivers and seas — and O heaven, 
abate!’, withhold the rain, and it did. And the waters subsided, decreased. And the affair was accom¬ 
plished, the matter of the destruction of Noahs people was complete, and it settled, [and] the ship came 
to reSt, upon al-Judi, a mountain in MeSJiotamia (al-jazira), near Mosul; and it was said: ‘Away with 

— perish — the evildoing, the disbelieving, folk!’","Noah said, “Board it; in the name of Allah it sails and anchors. My Lord is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” . As it sailed with them through waves like mountains, Noah called out to his son[22], who had kept himself apart, “O my son, come aboard with us, and do not be with the disbelievers.” . He said, “I will take shelter on a mountain which will save me from the water.” Noah said, “Today no one will be saved from Allah’s punishment except those on whom He may have mercy.” Thereupon the waves came between them, and he was among those who were drowned. . And it was said, “O earth, swallow up your water. O sky, withhold [your rain]!” The water subsided and the command was fulfilled, and the Ark settled on Mount Judi, and it was said, “Away with the wrongdoing people!”",[22] Who was a disbeliever.
11,45,48,"And Noah called out to his Lord and said, ‘My Lord, lo! my son, Canaan, is of my family, and 
You promised me that they would be saved, and truly Your promise is the Truth, which never fails, and 
You are the Mo ft Juft of Judges’, the moSt knowledgeable and the faireSt of them. He, [God] exalted be He, said: ‘ONoah, lo! he is not of your family, of those [who will be] saved, 
or of the followers of your religion; lo! it, that is, your asking me to save him, is not a righteous deed, for 
he is a disbeliever and there is no deliverance for disbelievers (' amalun ghayru salihin, ‘it is not a right¬ 
eous deed’: a variant reading has ‘amila, the verb, with ghayra in the accusative, in which case the person 
governing [the verb ‘amila] is his son). 7 So do notask of Me (read either fa-la tas’alanni, or fa-la tas’alni) 
that whereof you have no knowledge, in rested to saving your son. I admonish you left you be among 
the ignorant’, when you ask about what you do not know. He said, ‘My Lord, I seek refuge in You, from [the sin], that I should ask of You that whereof 
I have no knowledge. Unless You forgive me, my excess, and have mercy on me I shall be among the 
losers’. It was said, ‘O Noah, go down, disembark from the ship, in peace, in safety, or with a greeting, 
from Us and blessings, good things, upon you and upon some communities [that will fpring]from those 
with you, in the ship, that is, from their children and their seed, those who are [and those who will be] 
the believers. And [there will be other] communities (read umamun), [to 4 ?ring] from those with you, 
to whom We shall give enjoyment, in this world, and then a painful chaftisement will befall them’, in 
the Hereafter, and these will be the disbelievers.","Noah called out to his Lord, saying, “My Lord, my son is one of my family[23], and Your promise is true and You are the Most Just of all judges!” . Allah said, “O Noah, he is not of your family, for he was not righteous in his conduct. So do not ask Me of what you have no knowledge. I admonish you, so you do not be among the ignorant.” . Noah said, “My Lord, I seek refuge with You from asking You that of which I have no knowledge. Unless You forgive me and have mercy upon me, I will be among the losers.” . It was said, “O Noah, disembark with peace from Us, and with blessings upon you and upon some nations [descending] from those who are with you.

11,49,49,"Those, that is, these verses, containing [dories such as] the dory of Noah, are of the tidings of the

is for those who are God-fearing.",This is one of the stories of the unseen that we reveal to you [O Prophet]; neither you nor your people knew it before this. So be patient; the outcome is for the righteous.,
11,50,60,"And, We sent, to c Ad their brother, from the tribe, Hud. He said, ‘O my people, worship God!, 
affirm His Oneness. You have no god (min ildhin: min is extra) other than He. You, in your worship of 
graven images, do but invent, [you do but] invent lies against God. O my people, I do notask of you any wage for it, for the affirmation of His Oneness. Lo! my wage 
falls only upon Him Who originated me, created me. Will you not understand? And, O my people, ask forgiveness of your Lord, for [your] idolatry, then turn, return, to Him 
repentant, through obedience; He will release the sky, [He will release] the rain — for they had been 
denied it — upon you in abundance, with abundant rainfall, and He will add to you Strength to your 
Strength, through wealth and children. Do not turn away as sinners’, idolaters. They said, ‘O Hud, you have not brought us any clear proof, [any] evidence for what you say, 
and we are not going to forsake our gods on [the basis of] your saying, that is, because of what you say, 
and we are not believers in you. We say nothing, concerning you, save that one of our gods has possessed you in some evil way’, 
rendering you insane, for your having cursed them, and so you are raving. He said, ‘Lo! I call God to 
bear witness, for me, and you, bear witness also, that I am innocent of what you associate, with Him, beside Him; so plot against me, devise ways to destroy me, all together, you and your graven 
images, then give me no respite, grant me [no] reprieve. Truly I have put my trust in God, my Lord and your Lord; there is no (ma min: min is extra) 
creature, no living thing that treads upon this earth, but He takes it by the forelock, that is, [but] He is 
its possessor and subjugator, so that no benefit or harm occurs except by His permission — the forelock 
is ^jiecifically used here because he who is taken by his forelock suffers the ultimate humiliation. Surely 
my Lord is on a Straight path, that is, [on] the way of truth and justice. And if you turn away ( tawallaw : one of the two fa’letters [of tatawallaw ] has been omitted), that 
is, if you objecft, Still I have conveyed to you that wherewith I was sent to you, and my Lord will set in 
place of you a folk other than you. You cannot injure Him in any way, by your idolatry. Truly My Lord 
is Preserver, Watcher, over all things’. And when Our command. Our chastisement, came to pass We delivered Hud and those who 
believed with him by a mercy, by guidance, from Us, and We delivered them from a harsh, a severe, 
chastisement. And that was c Ad — [this is] an allusion to their remains; in other words, go forth in the land 
and look at these [remains]. God then describes their case, saying: they knowingly denied the signs of 
their Lord and disobeyed His messengers (rusulahu is in the plural, because when a person disobeys a 
messenger he has [effectively] disobeyed all of them, since they share a common principle in that [Mes¬ 
sage] with which they come, namely, [the principle of] Gods Oneness); and they, that is, the riffraff, 
followed the command of every rebellious tyrant, [every] leader of theirs who is obstinate with regard 
to the truth. And a curse was made to follow them in this world, from people, and on the Day of Resurrec¬ 
tion, a curse [will follow them] for all creatures to see. ‘Lo! c Ad disbelieved in, they knowingly denied, 
their Lord. Lo! away, [far] from Gods mercy, with c Ad, the folk of Hud!’","To the people of ‘Ād[24] We sent their brother Hūd. He said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no god other than Him. You are but fabricators[25]. . O my people, I ask you no reward for it. My reward is only with the One Who created me. Do you not then understand? . O my people, seek forgiveness of your Lord and turn to Him in repentance; He will send down upon you abundant rain from the sky and will add strength to your strength. So do not turn away in wickedness.” . They said, “O Hūd, you have not brought us any clear evidence, and we will not forsake our gods on account of what you say, nor will we believe in you. . All we can say is that some of our gods have afflicted you with madness[26].” He said, “I take Allah as a Witness, and you too be witnesses, that I disown whatever you associate . with Him. So plot against me all together, then give me no respite. . I put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord. There is no moving creature but He holds it by its forelock[27]. My Lord is on a straight path[28]. . But if you turn away, I have conveyed to you what I have been sent with. My Lord will replace you with other people, and you cannot harm Him in the least. My Lord watches over all things[29].” . When Our command came, We saved Hūd and those who believed with him by Our mercy, and We saved them from a harsh punishment. . Such were the people of ‘Ād, who denied the signs of their Lord, disobeyed His Messengers and followed the command of every obstinate oppressor. . They were overtaken by a curse in this world and again on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, ‘Ād denied their Lord; so away with ‘Ād, the people of Hūd!","[24] An Arabian tribe who rebelled against their Messenger, so Allah destroyed them.

God!, affirm His Oneness. You have no god other than He. He it is Who produced you, [Who] began 
your creation, from the earth, by creating your father Adam from it, and has given you to live therein.

would become [our] chief, before this, that has issued from you. Do you forbid us to worship what our 
fathers worshipped?, in the way of graven images? Truly we are in grave doubt, [doubt] creating [great] 
uncertainty, concerning that to which you are calling us’, in the way of [affirming] God’s Oneness. He said, ‘O my people, have you considered: if I am [aiding] upon a clear proof, a [clear] state¬ 
ment, from my Lord, and He has given me from Him mercy, prophethood, who will help me, [who will]

fier operated by the demonstrative noun [hadhihi, ‘this’]). Leave her to eat in God’s earth and do not 
cause her any harm, [by] hamstringing [her], left you be seized by a near chastisement’, if you do 
hamstring her. But they hamstrung her, Qudar hamstrung her at their command, and he, Salih, said, ‘Enjoy 
[yourselves], live, in your dwellings for three days, whereafter you will be destroyed. That is a promise 
that will not be belied’. So, when Our command came, for their destruction. We delivered Salih and those who believed 
with him, they numbered 4000, by a mercy from Us, and, We delivered them, from the ignominy of that 
day (read yawmi’idhin [if understood] as declinable, or read yawma’idhin on the basis of it [yawm, ‘day’] 
being annexed to an invariable [idhin, ‘that’], which is the majority view). 8 Truly your Lord is the Strong, 
the Mighty, the Vicftor. And those who did evil were seized by the Cry, so that they ended up lying lifeless prostrate in 
their habitations, keeled over their knees, dead, as if ( ka-an had been softened and its subject omitted, in other words [understand it as] 
ka’annahum ) they had not dwelt there, in their dwelling-place: ‘Lo! Thamud disbelieved in their Lord, 
lo! away with ThamudT (this may be read, declined, li-Thamudan, or left, as indeclinable, li-Thamuda, 
referring to the diStricft or the tribe).","To the people of Thamūd[30], We sent their brother Sālih. He said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no god except Him. It is He Who brought you into being from the earth and settled you therein. So seek His forgiveness then turn to Him in repentance, for My Lord is Ever Near, All-Responsive.” . They said, “O Sālih, we truly had hopes in you before this[31]. Do you forbid us to worship what our fathers used to worship? We are in disturbing doubt about what you are calling us to.” . He said, “O my people, what do you think, if I should have clear proof from my Lord, and He has bestowed mercy upon me from Himself, who could protect me from Allah if I were to disobey Him? You would only increase me in loss. . O my people, this she-camel[32] of Allah is a sign to you; so leave her to graze in Allah’s land, and do not touch her with harm, or else an imminent punishment will overtake you.” . But they hamstrung her, so he said, “Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days. That is an unfailing promise!” . So when Our command came, We saved Sālih and those who believed with him, by Our mercy, and from the disgrace of that day. Your Lord is the All-Powerful, the All-Mighty[33]. . The huge blast[34] seized those who did wrong, and they fell dead in their homes, . as though they had never lived there.

8 The author’s grammatical terminology may refer to more than one aijaed: of the phrase min khizyi yawmi’idhin, although it is 
quite clear what is being said. The firfl part of the gloss Sates that one may read yawmi’idhin according to the inflective rules of 
grammar; in other words one may read min khizyi yawmi’idhin, since there is an obvious genitive annexation: ‘from the ignominy 
of that day’ (sc. ‘from that day’s ignominy’). However, one may also understand a genitive annexation and read it, alternatively, as 
min khizyi yawma’idhin (allowed for by the grammarians, see Ibn Mujahid, Qira’at, 336). If there is no genitive annexation, then 
there can only be one reading, and that is min khizyin yawma’idhin, ‘from ignominy, on that day’: the latter element, yawma’idhin, 
must be read in this (accusative) form since it is now an adverb (zarj). This has a bearing on the second part of the author’s gram¬ 
matical gloss. The term mabni, ‘invariable’ or ‘indeclinable’, may refer to yawma’idhin, since, as an adverb, it can only be in this 
form; but it more properly refers to idhin, which is always ‘invariable’, in which case the idafa, ‘genitive annexation’, mentioned by 
the author, now refers to the relation of yawm to idhin, not to min khizy and yawma’idhin (on the explanation of the flatus and 
effed: of idhin, see Razi, Mafatih, xviii, 18, sub Q. 11:66). The possible readings then are as follows: min khizyin yawma’idhin, or 
min khizyi yawma’idhin, or min khizyi yawmi’idhin. The same grammar applies in other inflances in the Qur’an: see Q. 27:89 ( min

tiding of their destruction; and so We gave her the good tiding of Isaac, and, after Isaac, of Jacob, his 
son, whom she would live to see. 9 She said, ‘Woe to me! (yd waylata is an expression used in [reaction to] a serious matter; the alif 
[suffixed in waylata] substitutes for the yd’ of the genitive annexation [waylati, ‘my woe’]). Shall I bear 
a child when I am an old woman, 99 years old, and this my husband is an old man?, 100 or 120 years 
old 10 (shaykhan is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier, operated by the demonstrative 
import of dha, ‘this’). Tridy this is a Strange thing’, that a child should be born to such an aged couple. They said, ‘Are you astonished by God’s command?, [by] His power? The mercy of God and His 
blessings be upon you, O, people of the House!, the House of Abraham. Truly He is Praised, Glorious!’, 
Generous. And when the awe, the fear, departed from Abraham and the good tiding came to him, of a 
child, he began to plead with Us, pleading with Our messengers, concerning the, matter of the, people 
of Lot. Assuredly Abraham was forbearing, long-suffering, imploring, penitent, always returning [to 
God] in repentance: thus he said to them, ‘Would you destroy a town in which there are 300 believers?’ 
They said, ‘No’. He said, ‘Would you destroy a town in which there are 200 believers?’ They said, ‘No’. He 
said, ‘Would you destroy a town in which there are 40 believers?’ They said, ‘No’. He said, ‘Would you 
deStroy a town in which there are 14 believers?’ They said, ‘No’. He said, ‘What if there were one believer 
in it?’ They said, ‘No’. He said, ‘Lot is in if. They said, ‘We know full well who is in it’... to the end [of the 
narrative]. When he had pleaded with them at length, they said: ‘O Abraham, desiSt from this, pleading. 
Truly your Lord’s command, for their destruction, has gone forth, and truly there will come upon them 
a chastisement which cannot be repelled’.","Our messengers[35] came to Abraham with glad tidings[36]. They said, “Peace.” He said, “Peace.” And in a short while he brought a roasted calf. . When he saw their hands not reaching the food[37], he became suspicious and felt scared of them. They said, “Do not be scared. We have been sent to the people of Lot.” . His wife[38] was standing by and laughed after We gave her glad tidings of [the birth of] Isaac and Jacob after Isaac. . She said, “Alas for me![39] How can I bear a child while I am an old woman, and this is my husband, an old man? This is a strange thing indeed!” . They said, “Are you amazed at the decree of Allah? May Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you, O people of the house[40]. He is Praiseworthy, All-Glorious.” . When the shock of fear left Abraham and the glad tidings [of Isaac’s birth] came to him, he started pleading with Us[41] concerning the people of Lot. . Abraham was indeed forbearing, tenderhearted[42], and constantly returning in repentance. . [The angels said], “O Abraham, leave this[43], for indeed the command of your Lord has already come to pass, and there will come upon them a punishment that cannot be averted.”","[35] i.e., angels.

11,77,83,"And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was distressed, he was grieved on their account, 
and felt constrained in his power to protest them, because they had handsome faces and were dressed 
as [visiting] gueSts, and so he feared for them from his people, and he said, ‘litis is a distressful, a very 
difficult, day’. And his people, when they became aware of them, came to him, running, hastening, towards 
him — and previously, before they came, they had been committing abominations, namely, penetrative 
sexual intercourse with men. He, Lot, said, ‘O my people! Here are my daughters, marry with them; they 
are purer for you. So fear God, and do not degrade me, [do not] disgrace me, before my gueSts. Is there 
not among you any upright man?’, to enjoin decency and forbid indecency? They said, ‘You know full well that we have no right to, no need of, your daughters, and you 
know well what we desire’, in the way of sexual intercourse with men. He said, ‘Would that I had Strength, power, to resist you or could resort to some Strong support!’, 
[to] some clan that would help me, I would surely fall upon you. So, when the angels saw this, they said, ‘O Lot, tridy we are messengers of your Lord. They shall not reach you, with any 
harm, so travel with your family during a part of the night, and let not one of you turn round, leSt

9 The names of Ishmael and Isaac are etymologically associated with the context in which their birth was announced to Abraham. 
Thus Ishmael ( Ismail ) is associated (as is clear from the Arabic form of his name) with the Hebrew root for ‘hearing’, because it is 
said that in giving him this firft child, God hears the supplication of Abraham, who after many years of childlessness longed for a 
son. Similarly, Sarah laughed when she was told that, deijaite her old age and barrenness, she would give birth to a boy, and so he 
was called Isaac which is also derived from the Hebrew ‘to laugh’ (cf. Arabic idhak)-, see Jalal al-DIn al-Suyuti’s al-Itqanfi 'uliim 
al-Quran, 2 vols. (Beirut: Dar al-Kutub al-Tlmiyya, 1987), 11, 300.

being] an exception among [his] ‘family’, in other words, do no take her along when you travel) lo! she 
shall be smitten by that which smites them-, it is said that he did not take her along with him; it is also 
said that she did set out [with them] and turned round, and so exclaimed, ‘Woe is my people!’, at which 
point a Stone Struck her and killed her. When he [Lot] asked them about the time of their deStrucftion, 
they replied: Truly their try it is [for] the morning, and when he said, ‘I want it to be sooner’, they said: 
is the morning not nigh [enough]?’ So when Our command, for their deStrucftion, came to pass We made their uppermost, that is, 
their cities, the nethermost — when Gabriel raised them to the sky and dropped them upside down to 
the earth, and We rained upon them Slones of baked clay, clay baked in fire, one after another, marked, [each one of them] with the name of the person it would Strike, with your Lord (' inda 
rabbik is an adverbial qualifier for these [Stones]), and they, the Stones — or their lands — are not far 
from the evildoers, that is, [from] the people of Mecca. 11","When Our messengers[44] came to Lot, he was perturbed and felt troubled on their account[45], and said, “This is a distressing day.” . His people came rushing to him, and they were accustomed to committing evil deeds[46]. He said, “O my people, here are my daughters[47] [for marriage]; they are purer for you. So fear Allah and do not disgrace me concerning my guests. Is there not a right-minded man among you?” . They said, “You already know that we have no need for your daughters, and you surely know what we want!” . He said, “Would that I had some strength [to stop you] or could rely on a mighty support!” . [The angels said], “O Lot, we are messengers of your Lord; they can never reach you. So set out with your family in the dark part of the night, and none of you should look back, except your wife; she will suffer the same fate as the others. Their appointed time is the morning; is not the morning near?” . When Our command came, We turned their cities upside down and rained down upon them clustered stones of baked clay, . marked by your Lord; this is not far from the evildoers[48].","[44] i.e., angels.

11,84,88,"And, We sent, to Midian their brother ShiTayb. He said, ‘O my people, worship God!, affirm 
His Oneness. You have no god other than He. And diminish not the measure or the weight. I see you in 
prosperity, [enjoying] a grace which precludes any need for Stinting [people]; and I fear for you, should 
you not believe, the chastisement of a besetting day, [besetting] you, destroying you (the attribution of 
this term [‘besetting’] to ‘a day’ [as opposed to ‘the chastisement’] is figurative, for it [the chastisement] 
will take place thereupon). O my people, givefull measure and weight, fulfil [the due of] both of these, injustice, anddonot 
defraud people in reSped of their goods, do not diminish anything of their due, and do not be degener¬ 
ate in the land, working corruption, by killing or otherwise ( {la tathau] derives from ‘athiya, meaning 
afsada, ‘he corrupted’; mufsidin, ‘working corruption, is a circumstantial qualifier reiterating the import 
of the term operating it, tathau, ‘[do not] be degenerate’). The remainder [which is] from God, that provision of His which remains for you after you have 
given full measure and weight, is better for you, than fraud, if you are believers; and I am not a guardian 
over you’, a watcher, that I should requite you for your deeds: I was sent only as a warner. They said, to him mockingly: ‘O Shu c ayb, does your [way of] prayer command you, with the 
obligation [to make sure], that we should leave what our fathers [used to] worship, of idols, or, that we 
should cease, to do as we will with our goods?, meaning that such a command is an absurdity which no 
person calling to good would commend. You are indeed the forbearing, the right-guided’: they said this 
in mockery. He said, ‘O my people, have you considered that I might be [ading] upon a clear proof from my 
Lord and that He has provided me with fair, wholesome, sustenance from Him?, should I then blemish 
it with what is unlawful, in the way of fraud or Stinting? And I do not desire to be inconsistent, and then 
partake, in what I forbid you, thus committing the same. I desire only to set things right, in your case, by 
way of [enjoining] justice, so far as I am able. My success, my ability to do this [successfully] and [to en¬ 
join] other acfts of obedience, is only with God. In Him I truSt and to Him I turn, I return, [repentant].","And to the people of Midian We sent their brother Shu‘ayb. He said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no god besides Him. Do not give short measure or weight[49]. I see that you are in prosperity, but I fear for you the punishment of an encompassing Day. . O my people, give full measure and weight with justice and do not defraud people of their dues, nor go about spreading corruption on earth. . What remains from the provision of Allah is far better[50], if you are [true] believers; I am not a keeper over you.” . They said, “O Shu‘ayb, does your prayer command you that we should forsake what our forefathers worshiped, or that we should give up dealing with our wealth as we please? Indeed, you are such a forbearing and right-minded man![51]” . He said, “O my people, what do you think, if I should have a clear proof from my Lord, and He has given me good provision from Himself. I do not want to go against what I am forbidding you. I only want to put things right to the best of my ability. My success only comes through Allah; in Him I put my trust and to Him I turn.","[49] The cardinal sin of Lot’s people was lust, whereas the people of Shu‘ayb’s major sin was greed, for not being fair in trade. . [50] Whatever is left after giving full measure is better and purer than what is fraudulently gained. . [51] A sarcastic description implying the opposite (antiphrasis)."

wait for evildoers; but the author of the commentary clearly understands it as a geographical comment, referring to the proximity 
of the remains of Lot’s city to Mecca. 

12 For the range of nuances attributed to the root j-r-m, see q.v. in the Lisan of Ibn Manztir (11, 257ff); although the sense of‘crime’ 
seems obvious in this root, it is secondary, and the primary sense of ‘to earn — hence, ‘to deserve’ — mentioned in the Lisan, is 
dictated by the need to reflect the author’s own gloss.

Sura Hud 


the people of Hud, or the people of Salih, in the way of chastisement; and the people of Lot, that is, their 
dwelling-places or the era in which they were destroyed, are not far away front you, so take heed [of 
this]. And ask forgiveness of your Lord, then repent to Him. Truly my Lord is Merciful, to believers, 
Affectionate’, loving towards them. They said, in proclamation of their lack of concern: ‘O Shu c ayb, we do not understand much 
of what you say. Truly we see you are weak, abjeCt, among us, and were it not for your clan, we would 
have Stoned you; for you are not, too, powerful, [too] venerable, for us’, to Stone, but it is your clan that 
is powerful. He said, ‘O my people, is my clan more venerable in your sight than God?, such that you refrain 
from killing me because of them, instead of [your] protecting me for [being the Messenger of] God? And 
do you put Him, God, behind you, neglected?, rejected, behind your backs, not mindful of Him? Trtdy 
my Lord encompasses, in knowledge, what you do, and will requite you. And, O my people, aCt according to your ability, your circumstances, lo! I [too] am acting, ac¬ 
cording to mine. You will soon know upon whom (man is the relative particle introducing the direCt 
objeCt of [the aCtion of] ‘knowing’) will come the chastisement that will abase him, and who is a liar. 
And sit in watch, wait for the consequence of your affair: I too will be with you watching’, waiting. Sind when Our command came, for their destruction. We delivered ShiTayb and those who 
believed with him by a mercy from Us; and the Cry seized those who were evildoers — Gabriel cried 
at them — and they ended up lying lifeless prostrate in their habitations, keeled over on their knees, 
dead, as if (ka-an is softened, in other words [understand it as] ka-annahum ) they had never dwelt 
there: ‘Lo! Away with Midian, juSt as Thamud was done away with!’","O my people, do not let your opposition to me cause you to suffer a punishment similar to that of the people of Noah, the people of Hūd or the people of Sālih. And the people of Lot are not far away from you. . Seek forgiveness of your Lord and turn to Him in repentance. Indeed, My Lord is Most Merciful, Most Affectionate.” . They said, “O Shu‘ayb, we do not understand much of what you say, and we surely see you weak among us. Were it not for your clan, we would have surely stoned you, for you have no standing among us.” . He said, “O my people, does my clan have a higher status to you than Allah? And you have abandoned Him behind your backs. Indeed, my Lord encompasses all what you do. . O my people, do whatever you can; I will do mine. You will come to know who will receive a disgracing punishment, and who is a liar. Wait; I too am waiting with you.” . When Our command came, We saved Shu‘ayb and those who believed with him by Our mercy. But the huge blast seized the wrongdoers, so they fell dead in their homes, . as if they had never dwelt there. Behold, away with Midian just as it was with Thamūd!",
11,96,99,"And verily We sent Moses with Our signs and a clear warrant, a manifest and evident proof, t° Pharaoh and his council; but they followed Pharaoh’s command, and Pharaoh’s command 
was not right-guided, appropriate. He will go before his people on the Day of Resurrection, and they will follow him, as they did in 
this world, and he will lead them, he will admit them, to the Fire — an evil place, it is, for those enter¬ 
ing it! And a curse was made to follow them in this [world], as well as, a curse, on the Day of Resurrec¬ 
tion — evil is the assistance offered!, in their case.","And We sent Moses with Our signs[52] and compelling proof . to Pharaoh and his courtiers, but they followed the command of Pharaoh, even though the command of Pharaoh was misguided. . He will be at the forefront of his people on the Day of Resurrection, leading them into the Fire. What a terrible place to be led to! . They were pursued by a curse[53] in this world as well as on the Day of Resurrection. What a terrible gift to receive!","[52] The nine signs that Moses came with. (cf. 17:101, 27:12). .

11,100,102,"That, which is mentioned ( dhalika is the subject, the predicate of which [follows]), is [some¬ 
thing] of the tidings of the towns, which We relate to you, O Muhammad (s). Some of them, that is, [of] 
the towns, are Standing, only its inhabitants having been destroyed, and some, of them, have been cut 
down, destroyed together with its inhabitants, such that there are no veStiges thereof, much like crops 
harvested with sickles. And We did not wrong them, destroying them for not having committed any sins, but they 
wronged themselves, through idolatry. Their gods did not avail, defend, them in any way ( min shay’in : 
min is extra), those [gods] upon whom they called, [whom] they worshipped, besides God, that is, other 
than Him, when the command of your Lord, His chastisement, came; and they [their gods] — through 
their [the disbelievers’] worship of these [gods], did not increase them in anything but ruin, [but] loss. Such, like that seizing, is the seizing of your Lord when He seizes the towns, meaning its in¬ 
habitants, while they are doing wrong, by way of sins: in other words, nothing can avail them in any 
way when He seizes them. Truly His seizing is painful, severe. The two Shaykhs [Bukhari and Muslim]

Tafsir al-Jalalayn 

reported [by way of an isnad] from Abu Musa al-Ash'arl 13 that he said, ‘The Prophet (s) said, “God gives 
[extended] recite to the evildoer, but when He seizes him there is no escape for him”, whereupon the 
Prophet (s) recited the verse: Such is the seizing of your Lord [Q. 11:102, above]’.","These are some of the stories of the towns that We relate to you; some are still standing, while others have been mowed down[54]. . We did not wrong them, rather they wronged themselves. Their gods whom they invoked besides Allah were of no avail to them in the least when the command of your Lord came, and they only added to their destruction. . Such is the seizing of your Lord when He seizes the towns that are given to wrongdoing; His seizing is surely painful and severe.","[54] i.e., the remains of some towns are still standing while others are completely destroyed."
11,103,108,"I 7 i ere is indeed in that, which is mentioned of stories, a sign, a lesson, for him who fears the 
chastisement of the Hereafter: that, in other words, the Day of Resurrection, is a day to which, on 
which, mankind will be gathered, and that is a day witnessed, witnessed by all creatures. And We do not defer it but to a term [already] reckoned, [but] to a time predetermined by God. The day it, that day, comes, no soul shall Speak ( takallamu: one of the ta letters [of tatakallamu] 
has been omitted) except by His permission, exalted be He. Some of them, that is, [some] creatures, will 
be wretched, and [some], of them, joyous, each having been determined [to be thus] from pre-eternity. As for those who are damned, according to God’s [prior] knowledge, they will be in the Fire; 
their lot therein will be wailing, which is a loud sound, and sighing, which is a faint sound; abiding therein for as long as the heavens and the earth endure, that is, [for] the length of the 
duration of both in this world, except, other than, what your Lord may will, in the way of adding to 
the duration of these two, such that it [their abiding] becomes indefinite: meaning that they will abide 
therein forever. Truly your Lord is Doer of what He desires. And as for those who are fortunate (read saidu or suidu) they shall be in Paradise, abiding 
therein for as long as the heavens and the earth endure except, other than, what your Lord may will 
— as mentioned already [of increasing the duration], which in their case is indicated by His words, an 
endless bounty, [one not] to be cut off. The interpretation given above seems to be the clear and obvious 
one, 14 devoid of affectation, but God knows best what it means.","Indeed, there is a sign in this for those who fear the punishment of the Hereafter. That is a Day for which people will be gathered and a Day that will be witnessed. . We only delay it until a fixed term. . When that Day comes, no one will speak except by His permission. Some among them will be wretched and others blissful. . As for those who are wretched, they will be in the Fire, wherein they will be moaning and gasping, . they will abide therein for as long as the heavens and earth exist, except what your Lord wills; your Lord does what He wills. . As for those who are destined for bliss, they will be in Paradise abiding therein as long as the heavens and earth exist, except what your Lord wills[55] – an unceasing gift.","[55] i.e., except those sinners among the believers who will enter Hellfire before admitting to Paradise."
11,109,111,"So do not be, O Muhammad (s), in doubt, in uncertainty, concerning what these [folk] worship, 
of idols: We will indeed chastise them as We did those before them — this is intended as solace for the 
Prophet (s). They worship only as their fathers worshipped — that is, in the same way — before, and 
indeed We chastised them; and We shall surely pay them, like those [fathers of theirs], their whole due, 
their portion of the chastisement, undiminished, that is, in full. And We verily gave Moses the Scripture, the Torah, but differences arose concerning it, some 
believing, others denying, juSt as [is the case] with the Qur’an; and were it not for a word that went forth 
from your Lord, to defer the reckoning and the requital for creatures to the Day of Resurrection, the case 
would have been decided between them, in this world, regarding that over which they differed; and truly 
they, that is, those who deny it, are in grave doubt concerning it, [doubt] creating [great] uncertainty. And assuredly (read wa-in or wa-inna ) to each, that is, to all creatures, verily ( la-ma : the 
ma is extra and the lam is in the place of an implied oath or a separator; a variant reading has lamma, 
with the sense of ilia, ‘but’, making the [preceding] in for negation), your Lord will pay for his works, 
that is, the requital thereof, in full. Truly He is Aware of what they do, knowing the inner and outer 
aSJieCts thereof. 

13 Abu Musa al-Ash‘ari, ‘Abd Allah b. Qays, a Companion of the Prophet and a famous early military leader, of Yemeni origin (d. 
sometime between 42/662 and 52/673). He was governor of Basra and then Kufa, and was appointed as ‘All’s representative after 
the battle of Siffln (37/657) in the notorious ‘arbitration ( tahkim ) that was set up to adjudicate between the claims of ‘All and 
Mu‘awiya to the caliphate. See L. Veccia Vaglieri, s.v. ‘al-Ash‘ari, Abu Musa, E12, 1, 695; Ibn al-Athlr, Usd, in, 364-66, vi, 299f.; Ibn 
Hajar, Tahdhlb, in, 234f.; Dhahabi, Siyar, 11, 380-402. 

14 The apparent one, in other words, from reading the text as it stands. Muslim theologians used this verse to argue for the eventual 
salvation of all Muslims, even grave sinners who died without repenting. The notion of a temporary (purgative) punishment in 
Hell for Muslim sinners was the subject of much controversy in the developing theology of the 3 rd to 4 lh centuries ah (9 ti /10* ad). 
The idea was rejected by many in the early community, principally Mu'tazilis (since for them it violated the concept of Gods ‘adl, 
‘justice’); but it was also rejected by some of the early Murji’a and traditionisTs who preferred a more literal reading of the Qur’anic 
text, and who were persuaded by the idea that God might forgive a grave sinner completely, as opposed to sending him to Hell 
and then taking him out of it. Jalal al-Din al-Suyutl seems to have this debate in mind when he suggests that there is no need for a 
‘forced’ reading of this Qur’anic passage.

Sura Hud","Have no doubt about what they worship; they only worship what their forefathers worshiped. We will surely give them their full share undiminished. . We gave Moses the Scripture, but a dispute arose about it. If it had not been for a prior decree from your Lord, the matter would have been decided between them[56]. They are indeed in a disquieting doubt about it. . Your Lord will surely pay everyone in full for their deeds, for He is All-Aware of what they do.",[56] Not to hasten the punishment for them.

will requite you for it. And do not incline toward the evildoers, through affedtion or adulation, or [by showing] satis¬ 
faction with their adtions, left the Fire touch, smite, you, and you have, besides God, other than Him, no 
protestors (min awliya: min is extra), to guard you from Him; and then you will not be helped, you will

in the morning, at noon, and in the afternoon, and in some watches (zulafan is the plural of zulfa), a 
portion, of the night, that is, at sunset and late evening. Indeed good deeds, such as the five prayers, 
annul misdeeds, minor sins: this was revealed regarding one who kissed a female Stranger and told the 
Prophet (s) about it, and then asked him, ‘Is this [verse true] for me?’ and the Prophet said to him, ‘It is 
[so] for every person of my community’, as reported by the two Shaykhs [Bukhari and Muslim]. That is 
a remembrance for the mindful, an admonition for those who heed them. And be patient, O Muhammad (s), in [enduring] the harm inflicted [upon you] by your peo¬ 
ple, or in [performing] prayer, for indeed God does not wafte the wage of those who are virtuous, by 
patiently enduring through [aCts of] obedience [to God].","So stay on a straight path as you have been commanded, along with those who repented with you, and do not cross the limits[57]. Indeed, He is All-Seeing of what you do. . Do not incline to the wrongdoers, or else the Fire will seize you. Then you will have no protectors besides Allah, nor will you be helped. . Establish prayer at the two ends of the day and at some hours of the night. Indeed, good deeds wipe out evil deeds[58]. This is a reminder for those who are mindful. . And be patient, for indeed Allah does not let the reward of those who do good to go to waste.","[57] By committing sins. .

‘prostration’, which is an attribute associated with rational beings). He said, ‘O my son, do not relate your vision to your brothers, leSt they plot againSt you some 
plot, [leSt] they scheme to kill you, out of envy, knowing that the interpretation [of the dream] is that they 
represent the [eleven] planets, your mother, the sun and your father, the moon. Truly Satan is to man a

and upon the House of Jacob — [upon] his sons — as He perfeded it, with prophethood, formerly on 
your fathers Abraham and Isaac. Truly your Lord is Knower, of His creatures. Wise’, in what He does 
with them.","[Remember] when Joseph said to his father[2], “O my father, I saw [in a dream] eleven stars, the sun and the moon – I saw them prostrating to me.” . He said, “O my son, do not relate your vision to your brothers, lest they devise a plot against you, for Satan is a sworn enemy to mankind. . Thus your Lord will choose you and teach you the interpretation of dreams, and He will complete His favor upon you and upon the house of Jacob, just as He completed it upon your forefathers Abraham and Isaac before.

12,7,10,"Verily in, the tale of, Joseph and his brethren — who were eleven — are signs, lessons, for those 
who inquire, about their tale. 2 Mention, when they, that is, [when] some of Joseph’s brothers, said, to some of the others: ‘Surely 
Joseph ( la-Yusufu is the subject) and his brother, his full brother Benjamin, are dearer ( ahabbu is the 
predicate) to our father than we are, though we be a [hardy] band, a group. Lot our father is in plain 
aberration, in manifest error, for preferring those two to us. Kill Joseph or caSt him away into some land, that is, into some distant land, so that your father 
might be solely concerned with you, so that he might turn [his attention] to you and not be distracted by 
anyone else, and that thereafter, that is, after killing Joseph or casting him away, you might be a right¬ 
eous folk’, by repenting. One of them, namely, Judah, 3 said, ‘Do not kill Joseph, but cad him, throw him, into the bottom 
of a well (ghaydbat al-jubb is the darkest recess of a well; a variant reading has the plural [ghaydbdt ]), 
so that some caravan might pick him up, if you are to do anything’, of what you desire, in the way of 
separating [Joseph from us]: so content yourselves with this [solution].

When they said, “Joseph and his brother[3] are dearer to our father than we are, although we are a group of so many. Indeed, our father is clearly mistaken. . Kill Joseph or cast him out to another land, so that your father’s attention will only be to you; then you will become righteous people[4].” .

12,11,15,"They said, ‘O father, what is wrong with you that you do not truft us with Joseph? We are indeed 
his well-wishers, we are indeed only looking out for his beSt interests. Send him forth with us tomorrow, to the desert, to frolic and play (read [ fi rs't person plural]

me], because I would be separated from him, and I fear left the wolf devour him (al-dhi’b here rep¬

with them. So when they went off with him, and agreed, resolved, to put him into the bottom of the well

‘they did [juSt] that’) by taking off his shirt — after having beaten him, humiliated him and desiring to 
kill him — and lowering him in a bucket [into the well]. When he reached half-way down the well, they 
flung him [from the bucket] so that he would [fall and] die, but he fell into the water and took refuge 
near a rock. They then called to him and he responded, thinking that they had [decided to have] mercy 
on him. They then wanted to smash his head with a rock, but Judah prevented them. And We revealed 
to him, in the well, through true revelation ( wahy haqiqaf — he was 17 years of age or juSt under — in 
order to reassure his heart: ‘Truly you shall inform them, after this day, of this affair, [this] deed, of 
theirs when they are unaware’, of [who] you [are] ( wa-hum la yash’uruna is a circumstantial qualifier 
referring to the acftion of‘informing’).","They said, “O our father, why do you not trust us with Joseph[5], although we truly care for him? . Send him with us tomorrow so that he may enjoy himself and play; we will surely keep him safe.” . He said, “It truly saddens me that you should take him away, and I fear that a wolf may eat him when you are negligent of him.” . They said, “If a wolf were to eat him, despite our strong group, then we would surely be losers!” . Then when they took him away and they agreed to cast him into the bottom of the well, We inspired him: “You will surely inform them of this affair of theirs when they will not realize [who you are].”","[5] They formulated their challenging scheme carefully, in order to throw their father off guard."
12,16,18,"And they came to their father in the evening, weeping. They said, ‘O father, we went competing, shooting, and left Joseph by our things, our clothes, 
and the wolf ate him. But you would never believe us, even though we fpeak the truth’, before you, you 
would Still have accused us [of lying] in this Story, because of your adoration of Joseph, so how much 
more so when you think ill of us? And they came with false blood on his shirt (‘ala qamisihi has the Status of an accusative [of 
the verb], because it is an adverbial qualifier, meaning fawqa [qamisihi]): they slaughtered a lamb and 
dabbed it [his shirt] with its blood — but they forgot to tear it [the shirt] — and they said that it was his 
blood. He, Jacob, said, when he saw that it [the shirt] was undamaged and realised that they were lying: 
‘Nay, but your souls have beguiled you into something, and so you did it to him. Yet comely patience!, 
without any anxiety! (fa-sabrun jamilun is the predicate of a missing subject such as amri, ‘my course]’) 4 5 . 
And God is the One Whose succour is sought in that [predicament] which you describe’, that which you 
mention of Joseph’s affair.","At night they came to their father, crying. . They said, “O our father, we went off racing one another and left Joseph with our belongings, and a wolf ate him.

But I will bear it with beautiful patience. It is Allah’s help that I seek against what you claim.”",[6] They had stained Joseph's shirt with the blood of a lamb but had forgotten to tear it; a sure sign of their lying.
12,19,22,"And there came a caravan — travellers going from Midian to Egypt, who stopped near to Joseph’s 
well — and they sent their water-drawer, the one who goes down to the water [source] to draw from 
it, and he let down his bucket, into the well and Joseph clung to it and he pulled him out, and when he 
saw him: he said, ‘Good news!’ (a variant reading [of yd bushra] has yd bushraya: this [vocative] call is 
figurative, in other words [it is to be understood as] ‘Come [O good news], now is your time!’) ‘This is a 
young boy’. His brothers became aware of this and came to him, and they hid him, that is, they disguised 
his real Status, claiming that he was, as [apiece of] merchandise, by saying, ‘This is a slave of ours: he is 
a runaway’; but Joseph did not say anything, fearing that they might kill him. But God knew well what

they were doing. Then they sold hint — they [the caravan] purchased him from them — for a very low, a dimin¬ 
ished, price, a handful of dirhams, 20 or 22; for they, that is, his brothers, set small Store by him. So the 
caravan brought him to Egypt, where the one who had bought him sold him for 20 dinars, two pairs of 
sandals and two robes. And he of Egypt who purchased him, Potifar, the Court Officer (Qitfir al- c aziz ), 6 said to his wife, 
Zulaikha ( Zulaykha ), ‘Give him an honourable place, [an honourable] residence with us. Maybe he will 
be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son’ — for he was chaste. Thus, jusd as We delivered him from 
being killed and from the well, and softened the Court Officer’s heart for him, We established Joseph 
in the land, the land of Egypt, until he attained what [Status] he attained, that We might teach him the 
interpretation of events, the interpretation of visions ( wa-li-nuallimahu min ta’wili’l-ahddith is a sup¬ 
plement to an implied [missing part] connected to makkanna, ‘We established’, in other words, [an im¬ 
plied] li-numallikahu, ‘so that We might give him kingship’; 7 or else the wow [of wa-li-nuallimahu, ‘that 
We might teach him] is [to be understood as being] extra). God’s way [always] prevails, exalted be He, 
nothing being beyond Him, but moStpeople — and they are the disbelievers — do not know, this. And when he reached his prime — which was at 30 or 33 years of age — We gave him [power of] 
judgement, wisdom, and knowledge, understanding in [matters of] religion, before his call to prophet- 
hood. Thus, juSt as We rewarded him, We reward those who are virtuous, to [the good] of their souls.","Some travelers came and sent their water fetcher, who lowered his bucket into the well. He cried out, “Oh, what good news; here is a boy!” They kept him hidden as merchandise[7], but Allah is All-Knowing of what they did. . They sold him for a meager price, a few silver coins; they were quite indifferent about him[8]. . The man[9] in Egypt who bought him said to his wife, “Make his stay comfortable; perhaps he will benefit us or we may adopt him as a son.” This is how We established Joseph in the land, so that We may teach him the interpretation of dreams. Allah’s decree always prevails, but most people do not know. . When he reached his prime, We gave him wisdom[10] and knowledge. This is how We reward those who do good.","[7] To be sold as a slave. .

12,23,29,"And she, in whose house he was — namely Zulaykha — attempted to seduce him, that is, she 
asked him to lie with her, and she closed the doors, of the house. And she said, to him: ‘Come!’ (hayta 
laka: the lam [of laka] is for clarification; a variant reading has hita laka or haytu laka). ‘God forbid!’, 
I seek refuge with God from this, he said. ‘Truly he, who bought me, is my lord, my master, 8 who has 
given me an honourable place, [an honourable] residence, and so I cannot betray him with regard to his 
family. Truly, evildoers, fornicators, never prosper’. And she certainly desired him, she sought sexual intercourse with him, and he would have 
desired her [too], he would have sought the same, had it not been that he saw the proof of his Lord: 
Ibn ‘Abbas said, ‘Jacob was made to appear before him, and he struck his [Joseph’s] breast, whereupon 
his [sexual] desire withdrew [from his body] through his fingernails (the re^tonse to lawld, ‘had it not 
been’, has been omitted: [understood to be] la-jama’ahd, ‘he would have lain with her’). So it was, that 
We made him see the proof, that We might ward off from him evil, betrayal, and lewdness, [the ad of] 
fornication. Truly he was of Our devoted servants, in terms of obedience ( mukhlisin: a variant reading 
has mukhlasin, in other words, ‘chosen/purified [servants]’). And they raced to the door: Joseph making for it in order to escape, while she, in order to grab 
hold of him, caught hold of his garment and pulled him towards her, and she tore his shirt from behind, 
whereupon they encountered her master, her husband, at the door. She, composed herself and then, 
said, ‘What is to be the requital of him who intends evil, [who intends] fornication, againSt your folk, 
but that he should be imprisoned, locked up in a jail, or [suffer] a painfid chastisement?’, by having him 
beaten. He, Joseph, said, declaring himself innocent [of the charge]: ‘It was she who attempted to seduce 
me’. And a witness of her own folk testified, her paternal cousin — it is reported that he was Still [a child] 
in the cradle — and he said: ‘If his shirt has been torn from the front, then she Speaks the truth, and he 

6 He was also the captain of the guard: Gen. 37:36. 

7 This is the reading of the implied part given by the Bulaq edition. The point here is to explain the relationship of this clause to the 
previous one, particularly the intervention of the purposive clause beginning with wa-li-, which suggests that there is a preceding 
purposive clause, unless one reads the wa- as being redundant: in which case the clause in question becomes the purpose relating 
to the clause makkanna li-Yusufa. Put differently, either one understands the verse as: ‘Thus We established Joseph in the land [that 
We might give him kingship] and that We might teach him the interpretation of events’, or, if the wa- is understood to be redun¬ 
dant, ‘Thus We established Joseph in the land, that We might teach him the interpretation of events’. 

8 The point of the gloss, sayyidi, for rabbi , here and in numerous instances below, is to show that it is not a reference to the divine 
Lord, but to Joseph’s master of the house.

is of the liars; but if his shirt has been torn from behind, then she has lied, and he is of the truthful’. So when he, her husband, saw that his shirt was torn from behind, he said: ‘Indeed this — that 
is, your saying: ‘What is to be the requital of him who intends ...’to the end [of the verse, Q. 12:25] — is 
of the guile of you, O, women. Verily your guile is great. Then he said: O, Joseph, ignore this, matter and do not mention it [to anyone], ledl it be broad¬ 
cast; and you, O Zulaykha, ask forgiveness for your sin: surely you have been of the erring’, the sinful; 
but the tale was reported and became public.","But the woman[11] in whose house he was living tried to seduce him. She bolted the doors and said, “Come here to me!” He said, “I seek refuge with Allah! My master has made my stay good. Indeed, the wrongdoers will never succeed.” . She advanced towards him, and he would have advanced towards her, had he not seen a sign from his Lord. This is how We kept evil and shameful acts away from him. Indeed, he was one of Our chosen slaves. . They both rushed to the door and she tore his shirt from behind, and they found her husband at the door. She said, “What is the punishment for someone who tried to dishonor your wife, except to be imprisoned or a painful punishment?” . Joseph said, “It was she who tried to seduce me.” A witness from her own household suggested: “If his shirt is torn from the front, then she is telling the truth and he is a liar. . But if his shirt is torn from the back, then she is lying and he is truthful.” . When he saw that his shirt was torn from the back, he said, “This is your guile [O women]; your guile is great indeed! . O Joseph, forget about this; but you [O wife], seek forgiveness for your sin, for it was you who have done wrong.”","[11] i.e., the wife of the minister."
12,30,32,"And some of the women in the city, the city of Egypt, said, ‘The Court Officer’s wife has been 
seducing her boy, her servant. Indeed he has smitten her heart with love, ( hubban is for Specification, in 
other words, ‘[her] love of him has entered her heart’s pericardium ( shaghdfa qalbiha), that is, its inner

pared for them a repaft (muttaka ’ is food that requires cutting with a knife, since one leans upon it 
(ittika ’J: this [repaStj was utruj, citron). She then gave each one of them a knife and said, to Joseph: 
‘Come out before them!’ And when they saw him, they were in awe of, they exalted, him and cut their 
hands, with the knives, without feeling any pain, because their hearts were so engrossed by Joseph, and 
they exclaimed: ‘God preserve us! — in exaltation of him — This, namely, Joseph, is no human being: 
this is but a noble angel!’, on account of his all-encompassing beauty, which is [a characteristic] not 
usually found among humankind. In the Sahih [of al-Bukharl], it is [reported] that one half of all beauty 
was given to him. She, the wife of the Court Officer, said, when she saw what happened to them, ‘This is he on 
whose account, for the love of whom, you blamed me ( alladhi lumtunnani fihi is an explication of her 
excuse). Indeed I did attempt to seduce him, but he withheld himself, he refused. Yet if he does not do 
what I bid him, he verily shall be imprisoned, and verily shall be of those brought low’, those abased. 
The women said to him: ‘Obey your mistress!’.","Some women in the city said, “The chief minister’s wife is trying to seduce her slave-boy; his love has overwhelmed her heart. We see that she is clearly mistaken.” . When she heard of their gossip, she invited them and arranged for them a banquet, gave each one of them a knife, and said [to Joseph], “Come out before them.” When they saw him, they were so stunned[12] that they cut their hands, and said, “Great God! This cannot be human; this must be a noble angel.” . She said, “This is the one for whose love you reproached me. I did try to seduce him but he abstained. If he does not follow my order, he will surely be imprisoned and will be fully humiliated.”","[12] In the long Hadith of the Nocturnal Journey and Ascension (al-isrā’ wa al-mi‘rāj), Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) described Prophet Joseph (عليه السلام) when he met him as a man who is “Endowed with half of all human handsomeness.” [cf. Muslim: 162]"
12,33,35,"He said, ‘My Lord, prison is dearer to me than that to which they are urging me. And if You 
do not fend off their wiles from me, then I shall tend, I shall incline, towards them and become of the 
ignorant, the sinful: this is intended as a supplication, which is why God, exalted be He, then says: So his Lord answered him, his supplication, and He fended off their wiles from him. Truly He is 
the Hearer, of words, the Knower, of deeds. Then it seemed, it appeared, [good] to them, after they had seen the signs, indicating Joseph’s 
innocence, 9 that they should imprison him for a while, until such time as people ceased to talk of him. 
He was thus imprisoned.","Joseph said, “My Lord, I would rather be in prison than that to which they are calling me. Unless you protect me from their guile, I may succumb to them and fall into ignorance.” . So his Lord answered his prayer and protected him from their guile. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. . Then it occurred to them after they saw the signs [of his innocence] that they should imprison him for some time[13].",[13] so that the scandal be forgotten.
12,36,42,"And there entered the prison with him two youths, two young men [servants] of the king, one 
of whom was his cup-bearer, the other, his food-taster. They noticed that he interpreted dreams and so 
they said, ‘Let us try him’. One of them, the cup-bearer, said: ‘I dreamed that I was pressing wine’, that 
is, grapes. The other, the food-taSter, said: ‘I dreamed that I was carrying on my head bread whereof 
the birds were eating. Tell us, inform us [of], its interpretation, for indeed we see you as being among

interpretation thereof, while you are conscious, before it, the interpretation thereof, conies to you. This 
is from that which my Lord has taught me — herein is an incitement for them to believe, which he rein¬ 
forces with the following words: Lol I have forsaken the creed, the religion, of a folk who do not believe 
in God and who moreover (hum, ‘they’ [is repeated] for emphasis) are disbelievers in the Hereafter. And I follow the creed of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. It never was, right,/or us 
to associate anything (min shay’in: min is extra) with God — on account of our [God-given] immunity 
[from error]. That, affirmation of [God’s] Oneness, is from God’s bounty to us and to mankind; but mott 
people — and these are the disbelievers — do not give thanks, to God, and so they associate others with 
Him. He [Joseph] then explicitly calls them to faith, saying: O my two fellow-prisoners!, inmates [of 
the prison]: Are several lords better, or, is, God, the One, the Almighty, better? (an interrogative meant 
as an affirmative). You do not worship, apart from Him, that is, other than Him, anything but [mere] names that 
you have named, that you have named for idols, you and your fathers. God has not revealed any war¬ 
rant, any definitive argument or proof, regarding them, regarding worship of them. Judgement, decree, 
belongs only to God, alone. He has commanded that you worship none but Him. That, affirmation of 
[God’s] Oneness, is the upright, the straight, religion, but moft people — and these are the disbelievers 
— do not know, the punishment in which they shall end up, and so they ascribe partners [to God]. O fellow-prisoners! As for one of you, that is, the cup-bearer, he will depart after three [days] and, 
he shall serve his lord, his master, wine to drink, as usual; and as for the other, he will depart after three 
[days] and, he will be crucified so that the birds will eat from his head-, this is the interpretation of both 
your dreams. They said, ‘We never dreamed a thing!’; he said, decided, concluded, is the matter regard¬ 
ing which you sought opinion’, about which you enquired, whether you sjioke truthfully or were lying. Then he said to the one whom he deemed, [whom] he was certain, would be saved of the two — 
and this was the cup-bearer: ‘Mention me to your lord’, your master, and say to him, ‘There is a young 
man in jail who has been wrongly imprisoned’. So he [the cup-bearer] departed, but Satan caused him, 
that is, the cup-bearer, to forget the mention, of Joseph, before his matter, so that he, Joseph, ttayed, he 
remained, in prison for some years: it is said [that he remained] for seven years, or for twelve.","Two young men went to prison with him. One of them said, “I dreamt that I was pressing wine.” The other said, “I dreamt that I was carrying bread on my head of which birds were eating. Tell us their interpretation[14], for we see you as one of those who do good.” . Joseph said, “Before there comes to you the meal which you will be given, I will inform you of their interpretation. This is part of what my Lord has taught me. I have renounced the faith of people who do not believe in Allah and who deny the Hereafter. . I follow the faith of my fathers – Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; it is not right for us to associate any partner with Allah. This is from Allah’s favor upon us and upon people, but most people are ungrateful. . O my two fellow prisoners, which is better: many different lords or Allah, the One, the Subjugator? . You worship none besides Him except names that you and your forefathers have made up, for which Allah has not sent down any authority. All power belongs to Allah alone; He has commanded that you should worship none except Him[15]. This is the right religion, but most people do not know.” . “O my two fellow prisoners, as for one of you, he will serve wine to his master[16]; as for the other, he will be crucified and the birds will eat from his head. The matter you are asking about has been decreed.” . Then he said to the one he knew would be saved, “Mention me to your master.” But Satan made him forget to mention this to his master, so he remained in prison for several years.","[14] Interpretation of the dreams of his jail mates was the reason behind his victorious release and appointment as Chief Minister. . [15] Peoples’ sheer ignorance leads to associating partners with Allah. . [16] i.e., the king."
12,43,49,"And the king, the king of Egypt — al-Rayyan b. al-Walid — said, ‘I saw in [a dream] seven fat 
kine being devoured, being swallowed up, by seven lean ones, of kine (‘ijaf is the plural of ' ajfa ), and 
seven green ears of corn and others, that is seven [other] ears of corn, dry, that had wound themselves 
around the green ones and risen above them. O courtiers! Give me [your] opinion about my vision: 
expound for me its interpretation, if you can interpret visions’, then interpret it for me. They said, this is, ‘A jumble, a mixture, of dreams! And we are not knowledgeable in the inter¬ 
pretation of dreams’. And he of the two who was released, that is, of the two young men, namely, the cup-bearer, re¬ 
membering ( iddakara: the original ta [of tadhakkara] has been changed to a dal and assimilated with 
the dhal ), 10 after a time, [after] a period of time, the predicament of Joseph, said, ‘I will inform you of its 
interpretation; so send me forth’, so they sent him forth and he came to Joseph, and said: ‘O, Joseph, O truthful one, one given to truth, give us your opinion concerning seven fat kine 
that are devoured by seven lean ones, and [concerning] seven green ears of corn and [seven] others 
dry, that I may return to the people, that is, to the king and his courtiers, so that they might know’, its 
interpretation. 

10 In other words, iddakara is in fad tadhakkara: the ta ‘ of the latter is replaced by a dal and its dhal is assimilated with the new dal, 
whereupon the dal becomes doubled ( dd ) and the hamza (i-) is added to allow pronunciation. The transformation to iddakara 
is thus complete.

Tafsir al-Jalalayn He said, ‘You shall sow — that is, [go ahead and] sow — seven years consecutively — and this 
was the interpretation of the seven fat ones — but that which you reap, leave it in the ear, leSt it Sjioil, 
except for a little which you eat: thresh it. Then after that, in other words, after the seven fertile [years], there shall come seven hard, bar¬ 
ren and unyielding, years — the interpretation of the seven lean ones — which shall devour what you 
set aside for them, of grain sown during the fertile years, in other words, you shall eat [all] this during 
these [seven hard years], all except a little which you have preserved, stored. Hien after that, in other words, after the seven barren years, there shall come a year in which 
the people will be granted relief, through rain, and in which they will press [fruit], grapes, and other 
[seeds], because of its [that year’s] fertility.","The King said, “I dreamt of seven fat cows eaten up by seven lean ones, and seven green ears of grain and [seven] others withered. O chiefs, explain my dream to me if you can interpret dreams.” . They said, “These are jumbled dreams, and we do not know the interpretation of such dreams.” . The freed prisoner remembered after a long time had passed, and said, “I will inform you of its interpretation, so send me forth.” . [He said], “Joseph, O man of truth, tell us about seven fat cows eaten up by seven lean ones, and seven green ears of grain and [seven] others withered, so that I may return to the people and that they may know.” . Joseph said, “You will grow crops for seven consecutive years. But whatever you harvest, leave it in its ear, except for a little that you may eat. . Then after that will come seven years of hardship which will devour all what you had stored, except for a little that you may set aside[17]. . Then after that will come a year in which people will have abundant rain, and in which they will press [grapes and olives].”",[17] In their granaries.
12,50,57,"And the king, after the messenger had come to him and informed him of its [the dream’s] 
interpretation, said: ‘Bring him to me!’, that is, the one who interpreted it. And when the messenger 
came to him, that is, [to] Joseph, and summoned him in order to depart [from the prison], he said 
— with the intention of manifesting his innocence — ‘Return to your lord and ask him, to inquire: 
“What of, [what was] the case with, the women who cut their hands?” Surely my lord, my master, has 
knowledge of their guile’; he [the messenger] thus returned and informed the king, who then sum¬ 
moned them [the women]. He said, ‘What was your business, women, when you solicited Joseph?’, did you find on his part 
any inclination towards you?: ‘God preserve us!’ they said. ‘We know of no evil in him.’ The Court Of¬ 
ficer’s wife said, ‘Now the truth is out, [now] it has become clear; it was I who attempted to seduce him 
and he is indeed of the truthful’, in his saying, It was she who attempted to seduce me [Q. 12:26]. Joseph 
was then informed of this and he said: ‘That, plea of innocence, is so that he, the Court officer, may know I did not betray him, with 
regard to his family, in his absence ( bi’l-ghayb is a circumstantial qualifier), and that truly God does not 
guide [to success] the guile of the treacherous; he [Joseph] then humbled himself before God and said: Yet I do not exculpate my own soul, of slipping into error; verily the soul, as such, 11 is ever incit¬ 
ing to evil, except that whereon, meaning the person [upon whom], my Lord has mercy, and so protects 
[from sin]. Truly my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful’. And the king said, ‘Bring him to me, that I may use him for myself’, that I may make him mine 
exclusively, with none to share [him with me]. The messenger came to him [to Joseph] and said, ‘Re¬ 
spond to the king!’, and so he got up and bid farewell to [his] fellow-prisoners and prayed for them. He 
then washed himself, put on some good clothes and entered upon him. And when he had spoken with 
him, he said, to him: ‘Indeed you are on this day in our presence established and trustworthy’, a person 
of Status, entrusted over our affair, so what do you think we should do? He said, ‘Gather food [Stocks] 
and sow abundantly in these fertile years, then Store the corn in its ears. People [from far and wide] will 
come to you and ask you to supply them [with provisions]’. He [the king] said, ‘Whom can I delegate 
this [task] to?’ He, Joseph, said, ‘Place me in charge of the Storehouses of the land, the land of Egypt. I am in¬ 
deed a skilled custodian’, one worthy of custodianship thereof, and knowledgeable in such affairs — it is 
also said [that he meant]: [I am indeed] a [competent] scribe and accountant. Thus, in the same way that We were graceful towards Him by delivering him from prison, We 
established Joseph in the land, the land of Egypt, that he may settle in it wherever he wished, after 
[having suffered] hardship and imprisonment. According to the Story, the king crowned him, gave him 
a signet-ring to wear, and appointed him in place of the Court officer, whom he removed from his posi¬ 
tion, and who later died; and so he [the king] made him [Joseph] take the latter’s Spouse as a wife. He

[Joseph] discovered that she was [ffill] a virgin and she bore him two children. He [Joseph] established 
justice in Egypt and people became subject to him. We confer Our mercy on whomever We will and We 
do not watte the wage of the virtuous. Yet the wage of the Hereafter is better, than the wage of this world, for those who believe and are 
God-fearing. And so the years of drought arrived and afflicfted the land of Canaan and Syria.","The King said, “Bring him to me[18].” But when the messenger came to him, he said, “Go back to your master and ask him, ‘What was the case of the women who cut their hands?’ Indeed, my Lord is All-Knowing of their guile.” . The king said, “What happened when you [O women] tried to seduce Joseph?” They said, “Allah forbid; we know nothing bad about him.” The chief minister’s wife said, “Now the truth has come to light. It was I who tried to seduce him, and he is surely the truthful. . That is because he [i.e., the chief] should know that I did not betray him in his absence, for Allah does not lead the guile of the betrayers to succeed.” . I[19] do not absolve myself of blame, for Indeed the soul prompts one to evil, except those to whom my Lord may show mercy. Indeed, my Lord is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” . The King said, “Bring him to me; I will appoint him [as an adviser] exclusively to myself.” Then when he spoke to him, he said, “You are today in a highly-esteemed position and fully trusted by us.” . Joseph said, “Put me in charge of the storehouses of the land[20]; I am indeed a good keeper and knowledgeable[21].” . This is how We established Joseph in the land[22] so that he may settle wherever he wished. We extend Our mercy to whom We will, and We do not let the reward of those who do good to go to waste. . But the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believe and fear Allah.","[18] To underline Joseph’s fortitude, Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) said: “Had I stayed in jail as long as Yūsuf did, I would have answered the caller!” [Al-Bukhārī:3372, Muslim:151]. Understandably, any person in Yūsuf’s most desperate position would have rushed out at the first opportunity. Yet he wanted the end of his imprisonment on favorable grounds and to prove his innocence. . [19] i.e., the wife of al-‘Azeez. . [20] He found himself in a better position than anyone else for those difficult days ahead, so he offered his services. [21] The two most needed traits in a treasurer. . [22] This is the final episode in Joseph’s journey to greatness. The first was becoming a member of the Chief Minister’s household in his tender years (verse 21 above)."
12,58,62,"And Joseph’s brothers came — except for Benjamin — in order to secure provisions, when they 
found out that the [new] Court officer of Egypt was providing food at its [fair] price; and they entered 
to him, and he recognised them, to be his brothers, but they did not recognise him, not knowing who 
he was, because it had been a long time since they had seen him, and because they supposed that he had 
died. They S]x>ke to him in Hebrew and he said to them, as if reproaching them: ‘What brings you to my 
land?’ They replied, ‘[We have come] for supplies’. He said, ‘You might be SJ>ies!’ They said, ‘God forbid!’ 
He said, ‘So where are you from?’ They said, ‘From the land of Canaan, our father is Jacob, the prophet 
of God.’ He said, ‘Does he have children other than you?’ They said, ‘Yes. We used to be twelve, but the 
youngest of us passed away: he perished in the wild. He was the mo£t beloved to him [our father] from 
among us; only his full brother remains, and so he keeps him by his side, in order to comfort himself with 
him in place of the other.’ He [Joseph] commanded that they be given lodging and treated well. And when he had equipped them with their provision, [when] he had given them the full meas¬ 
ure [of food], he said, ‘Bring me a brother of yours from your father, namely, Benjamin, that I might 
know that you have been truthful in what you said. Do you not see that I give the full measure, that I 
complete it, without any fraud, and that I am the bett ofhotts? But if you do not bring him to me, there will be no measure, that is, no provisions, for you 
with me; and do not come near [me]’ ( wa-la taqrabun is [either] a prohibition, or a supplement to the 
[syntactical] locus of fa-la kayla, in other words, ‘and you shall be denied [the measure] and will not [be 
allowed to] come near [me]’). They said, ‘We will try to tempt his father away from him, that is, we will try our hardest to seek 
him from him. That we will surely do’. And he said to his young men ( li-fityatihi: a variant reading has li-fityanihi, ‘his servants’): ‘Place 
their merchandise, that [money] with which they bought the supplies, and these were a few dirhams, in 
their saddlebags, their [supply] sacks, so that they may recognise it when they return to their folk, and 
empty their sacks, and so come back’, to us, deeming it unlawful to retain these [monies].","The brothers of Joseph came and presented themselves before him; he recognized them but they did not know him. . When he prepared for them their rations, he said, “Bring me your step-brother[23]; do you not see that I give full measure and I am the best host? . If you do not bring him to me, you will never receive any measure [of grain] from me, nor will you even come close to me.” . They said, “We will persuade his father to send him[24], and we will surely do our best.” . Joseph said to his servants, “Put their trading goods back in their saddlebags so that they may find them when they go back to their family; perhaps they will return.”","[23] i.e., Benjamin. . [24] They knew its difficulty, but they still made a promise."
12,63,66,"So when they went back to their father, they said, ‘O father, the measure will be denied us, un¬ 
less you send forth our brother to him [to the Court officer]; so send forth our brother with us, that we 
may obtain the measure (read naktal or yaktal, ‘that he may obtain the measure [for us’]). Surely we will 
guard him well’. He said, ‘Should I — [I will] only — trutt you with him like I trutted you with his brother, 
Joseph, before? despite [the facft] that you have done to him what you have done? Yet God is bett at 
guarding (hifzan: a variant reading has hafizan, ‘a guardian, as a .‘ijiecification, similar to when they say 
li’Llahi darruhu farisan, ‘By God, how excellent a horseman he is!’); 12 and He is the Mott Merciful of 
merciful ones’, and so I hope that He will show favour [to me] by guarding him. And when they opened their belongings, they found that their merchandise had been rettored 
to them. They said, ‘O father, what [more] should we desire? (ma nabghr. ma is interrogative, that is to 
say: what greater thing than this can we ask for from the king’s generosity?’; a variant reading has ma 
tabghi, ‘what [more] do you desire?’, as an address to Jacob — for they had mentioned to him his [the 
king’s] generosity towards them). Here is our merchandise rettored to us. And we shall get provisions 
for our family, we shall obtain supplies for them, namely, food, and guard our brother, and we shall re-

hafizan).

ceive an extra camel’s load, because of our brother; that will be an easy measure’, for the king [to grant 
us], given his munificence. He said, ‘I will not send him with you until you give me a [solemn] pledge, a covenant, in the 
name of God, by your swearing an oath, that assuredly you will bring him back to me, unless you are 
besieged’, such that you die, or are overwhelmed and thus unable to bring him back. They agreed to this. 
And when they gave him their [solemn] pledge, to this effedt, he said, ‘God shall be Guardian, Witness, 
over what we say’, we and you. Thus he sent him with them.","When they returned to their father, they said, “O our father, we have been denied any further measure [of grain]; send our brother with us so that we may receive our measure, and we will surely protect him.” . He said, “Should I trust you with him as I trusted you earlier with his brother[25]? But Allah is the best Protector, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.” . When they opened their baggage, they found that their merchandise had been returned to them. They said, “O our father, what more could we ask for? Here are our trading goods returned to us. We can bring more food to our family, protect our brother, and obtain an extra camel-load of grain[26]. That measure is easily secured.” . He said, “I will never send him with you unless you give me a pledge by Allah that you will surely bring him back to me, unless you are completely overpowered.” Then when they gave him their pledge, he said, “Allah is Witness to what we say.”",[25] Saying this is an indication of a softer position taken by Jacob on the issue. . [26] They mentioned this to cajole their father of their good intentions.
12,67,68,"And he said, ‘O my sons, do not enter, Egypt, by one gate, but enter by separate gates, leSt the 
evil eye smite you. Yet I cannot avail, protedt, you, by this that I have said, against God ( min Allahi: min 
is extra) anything, which He might have decreed against you; this [that I have said] is only out of affec¬ 
tion [for you]. Judgement belongs to God, alone. On Him I rely, in Him I trus't, and on Him let all the 
trusting rely’. God, exalted be He, says: And when they entered in the manner which their father had bidden 
them, that is, separately, it did not avail them anything (min shay’in: min is extra) against God, that is, 
[against] His decree; it was but a need in Jacob’s soul which he [thus] satisfied, and this [need] was his 
desire to fend off the evil eye [from them], out of affedtion [for them]. And verily he was possessed of 
knowledge, because We had taught him; but moil of mankind — and they are the disbelievers — do not 
know, [about] Gods inspiring His eledt.","And he said, “O my sons, do not enter all from one gate, but enter from different gates[27]. I cannot avail you anything against [the decree of] Allah; the decision belongs to Allah alone. In Him I put my trust, and in Him let the faithful put their trust.” . When they entered as their father had instructed them, it could not avail them against [the decree of] Allah whatsoever, yet a need in Jacob’s heart was satisfied. He was indeed a man of knowledge because of what We had taught him, but most people do not know.","[27] There is an edifying note here. Besides putting trust in Allah, one needs to take precautions."
12,69,76,"And when they entered to Joseph, he took his brother into his arms, saying [to him]: ‘Tridy it is 
me, your brother, therefore do not deipair, do not be grieved, at what they did’, in the way of envying 
us. He commanded him not to tell them anything, and he [Joseph] agreed with him that he would devise 
a trick to keep him [Benjamin] with him. And when he had equipped them with their provision, he put the drinking-cup, a golden cup 
studded with jewels, into the saddlebag of his brother, Benjamin. Then a crier shouted, a herald cried, 
after they were dismissed from Joseph’s court: ‘O cameleers, caravan, you are surely thieves!’ They said, after, coming towards them, ‘What is it that you are missing?’ They said, ‘We are missing the king’s goblet, [his] cup. And he who brings it shall have a camel’s 
load, of food [supplies], and I will guarantee that’, the [camel’s] load. They said, ‘By God,’ (ta’Lldhi is an oath, entailing astonishment) ‘You know very well that we 
did not come to work corruption in the land, and we are certainly not thieves’, that is, we have never 
Stolen [anything]. They, the crier and his men, said, ‘So, what shall be his requital, that is, the thief’s, if you prove to have 
been liars?’, when you said, ‘we are certainly not thieves’, and [if] it is found among your belongings? They said, ‘His requital (qdlu jazauhu: the subjedt, the predicate of which is [the following, 
man wujidafi rahlihi) shall be [the requital of] him in whose saddlebag it is found, that he be en¬ 
slaved — this is then reiterated by His words: He, the thief, shall be the requital for it, that is, [for] the 
Stolen item, and nothing else: this was the cuStomary pradtice of the family of Jacob. Thus, [with such] 
a requital, do we requite those who do evil’, through theft. They thus permitted Joseph to have their 
saddlebags searched. And so he began with their sacks, and searched them, before his brother’s sack, leSt he be ac¬ 
cused [of the theft]; then he pulled it, the drinking-cup, out of his brother’s sack. God, exalted be He, 
says: Thus, [through such] contrivance, did We contrive for Joseph, [thus] We taught him how to devise 
a plot to take his brother; he, Joseph, could not have taken his brother, as a slave, on account of theft, 
accordingto the king’s law, [according] to the laws of the king of Egypt — since his [a thief’s] requital ac¬ 
cording to his law would have been a beating and a penalty of twice [the value of] the Stolen item, but not 
enslavement — unless God willed, for him to be taken according to the law of his father [Jacob]; in other

words, he was only able to take him with God’s will, by God’s mining him to ask his brothers [about the 
nature of requital] and their responding according to [what is decreed by] their customary practice. We 
raise by degrees whom We will (read with a genitive annexation, darajati man nasha, or [simply] with 
nunation, darajatin man nasha), in terms of knowledge, as [We did] with Joseph; and above every man 
of knowledge, from among creatures, is one who knows better, better than him [and so on] until it ends 
with God, exalted be He.","When they came into Joseph’s presence, he called his brother [Benjamin] aside, and said, “I am indeed your brother, so do not be saddened by their past actions.” . When he prepared for them their rations, he placed the [royal] drinking vessel in his brother’s saddlebag. Then an announcer called out, “O people of the caravan, you must be thieves!” . They said as they turned back, “What are you missing?” . They said, “We are missing the king’s measuring cup. Whoever brings it will have a camel-load [of grain]; and I guarantee it.” . They said, “By Allah, you know well that we did not come to spread corruption in the land, nor are we thieves.” . They said, “What should the punishment be[28], if you are liars?” . They said, “The punishment is that the one in whose saddlebag it is found should be enslaved in recompense. This is how we punish the wrongdoers.” . So he began searching their bags before his brother’s bag[29], then he brought it out of his brother’s bag. This is how We planned for Joseph; he could not have detained his brother under the King’s law, unless Allah so willed. We raise in ranks whom We will, but above each one who possesses knowledge is the All-Knowing One.",[28] The punishment for theft. . [29] To avert suspicion.
12,77,79,"They said, ‘If he is Stealing, a brother of his Stole before’, that is, Joseph — he had stolen a golden 
idol from his maternal grandfather and smashed it, le£t he worship it. But Joseph kept it secret in his soul 
and did not disclose it, manifest it, to them (the [suffixed] pronoun [in yubdi-ha, ‘disclose it’] refers to 
the word[s] in his [following] saying); he said, within himself: ‘You are a worse case, than Joseph and his 
brother, because of your stealing a brother of yours from your father, and your wronging him. And God 
knows very well what you are describing’, [what] you are mentioning with regard to him. They said, ‘O Court officer, lol he has a father, an aged man, who loves him more than we do, 
and who finds solace in him from [the anguish he feels for] his dead son; and it will grieve him to part 
with him, so take one of us, enslave him, in his place, instead of him: indeed we see that you are among 
the virtuous’, in [terms of] your addons. He said, ‘Godforbid (maadha’Llahi, [lit.] refuge is with God’, is in the accusative because it is a ver¬ 
bal noun, the verb having been omitted and placed in a genitive annexation with its dired objed, in other 
words, [understand it as] na’udhu bi’Llahi, ‘we seek refuge with God’) that we should take anyone save him 
with whom we found our property — he did not say ‘ [save] him who dole [our property] ’, being careful not 
to lie; for then truly — if we were to take anyone other than him — we would be evildoers’.","They said, “If he steals, then it was his brother [Joseph] who stole before.” Joseph kept it to himself and did not reveal it to them, and said [in his heart], “You are in a far worse position; and Allah knows best the truth of what you say.” . They said, “O chief minister, he has an elderly and vulnerable father, so take one of us instead of him, for we see that you are a kind man.” . Joseph said, “Allah forbid that we should take except the one with whom we found our property, for we would then be unjust.”",
12,80,80,"So when they despaired of[ moving] him, they withdrew to confer privately [ together] ( najiyyan 
is a verbal noun that can be used to refer to one person or more, in other words [underdand it as mean¬ 
ing] yundji baduhum badan, ‘one conferring with the other’). The moSt senior of them, in years — Re¬ 
uben — or, [the mod senior of them] in opinion — Judah, said: ‘Are you not aware that your father has 
taken a solemn pledge, a covenant, from you by God, concerning your brother, and formerly ( wa-min 
qablu md: the md is extra) you failed regarding Joseph ? (but it [the rnd\ is also said to be relating to the 
verbal adion, [in other words it is] a subjed, the predicate of which is min qabl, ‘formerly’). 13 So I will 
never leave, part with, this land, the land of Egypt, until my father permits me, to return to him, or God 
judges for me, through the deliverance of my brother; and He is the beSt, the faired, of judges.","When they lost hope in him, they conferred privately. The eldest of them said, “Do you not know that your father has taken from you a solemn pledge by Allah, and before this you failed with regard to Joseph? Therefore, I will never leave this land until my father gives me permission[30] or Allah decides for me, for He is the Best of Judges.",[30] Alluding to their father that this situation was different from Joseph’s.
12,81,87,"Go back to your father and say, “O our father, your son has indeed Stolen and we testified, 
againd him, only regarding what we knew, from the certainty of having seen the [king’s] cup in his sad¬ 
dlebag; we could not have guarded againSt the Unseen, that which was hidden from us, when we gave 
our pledge: had we known that he would deal, we would not have taken him [with us to Egypt]. And ask the city in which we were — namely Egypt — in other words, send forth [someone] to 
ask its people, and the caravan, the men of the caravan, with which we approached — and these were 
a group of Canaanites. Surely we Speak the truth” ’, in what we say. So they went back to him and told 
him as much. ‘Nay,’ he said, ‘but your souls have beguiled you into, have adorned [for you], something, and 
you did it: he accused them because of what had happened with them before concerning Joseph. Yet 
comely patience, will be my [course of] patience! It may be that God will bring them, Joseph and his two 
brothers, 14 all [back] to me. Indeed He is the Knower, of my predicament, the Wise’, in His aeftions. 

13 The import is the same in both cases, only they have slightly differing nuances. If the ma is redundant then the effect is ‘are you 
not aware that your father has taken from you a solemn pledge by God?; and formerly you failed regarding Joseph’; if it relates to 
the verbal aeftion then the meaning is ‘are you not aware that your father has taken from you a solemn pledge by God and [aware 
of] that in which you failed formerly regarding Joseph?’. 

14 Benjamin and the one who flayed behind, either Reuben or Judah (see Q. 12:80).

unless it is proclaimed [yubaththu] to others — and grief only to God, not to any other than Him, for it 
is worth complaining to Him; and I know from God what you do not know, [and that is] that Joseph’s 
dream is true and that he is alive. Then he said: O my sons, go and enquire about Joseph and his brother, seek news of them, and do not despair 
of God’s [gracious] Spirit, His mercy. Indeed none despairs of the [gracious] Spirit of God save the dis¬ 
believing folk’-. and so they departed to Egypt [to look] for Joseph.","Go back to your father and say, ‘O our father, your son has committed theft, and we did not tell you except what we saw, and we had no knowledge of the unseen[31]. . Ask [the people of] the town where we were and the caravan we came with, and we are surely telling the truth.” . He said, “No, but your souls have enticed you to commit something. But I will bear this with beautiful patience; perhaps Allah will bring them all[32] back to me, for He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.” . He turned away from them and said, “O my sorrow for Joseph!” And his eyes turned white[33] because of suppressing his grief. . They said, “By Allah, you will not cease to remember Joseph until your health is ruined or you die.” . He said, “I only complain of my anguish and sorrow to Allah, and I know from Allah what you do not know. . O my sons, go and find out[34] about Joseph and his brother, and do not despair of Allah’s mercy. Indeed, no one despairs of Allah’s mercy except the disbelieving people.”","[31] i.e., we had not known that he would steal when we gave you the oath. . [32] i.e., his three missing sons. . [33] i.e., he lost his sight. . [34] Tahassasū (lit. grope): to be extra vigilant in the search for them."
12,88,92,"And so when they entered to him, they said, ‘O Court officer, misfortune, hunger, has befallen 
us and our family; and we have come with reject merchandise, refused by any person who sees it, be¬ 
cause of its worthlessness — it consisted of counterfeit dirhams or something else — so fill up, complete, 
for us the measure and be charitable to us, by overlooking the worthlessness of our merchandise; truly 
God requites the charitable’. He rewards them: he [Joseph] thus took pity on them and he was overtaken 
by compassion [for them] and removed the partition between them and himself. Then, he said, to them, in rebuke: ‘Do you realise what you did to Joseph, in the way of beating 
[him] and selling [him] and otherwise, and his brother, oppressing him, after having separated him 
from his brother, while you were ignorant?’, of where the affair of Joseph will lead? T 7 i ey said — after recognising him by his noble traits — cautiously [inquiring]: ‘Is it really (read 
a-innaka, either pronouncing both hamzas, or by not pronouncing the second, but in both cases insert¬ 
ing an alif) you, Joseph?’. He said, ‘I am [indeed] Joseph, and this is my brother. God has truly shown 
favour. He has been gracious, to us, by bringing [us] together. Verily if one fears, [if] one fears God, and 
endures, what happens to him, God does not wafle the wage of those who are virtuous’, in this [rested] 
(the overt noun [al-muhsinin, ‘the virtuous’] has replaced the [third person] pronominalisation). They said, ‘By God, truly God has preferred you over us, with kingship and in other ways, and 
indeed we (wa-in: in is softened, in other words [it is understood as] inna, ‘indeed we’) have been erring’, 
sinful towards you and treated you disgracefully. He said, ‘There shall be no reproach, [no] blame, on you this day — he Specifically mentions 
this [day] because it was [the day] when they expecfted to be reproached, although any other day would 
have been more appropriate [for them to be reproached on]. God will forgive you, and He is the Mo ft 
Merciful of the merciful.","When they came into Joseph’s presence, they said, “O chief minister, we and our family have been struck with adversity, and we have brought some goods of scanty worth. So give us full measure [of grain] and be charitable to us, for Allah rewards those who are charitable.” . He said, “Do you know what you did to Joseph and his brother when you were ignorant[35]?” . They said, “Are you really Joseph?” He said, “I am Joseph, and this is my brother. Allah has surely been gracious to us[36]. Whoever fears Allah and remains patient, Allah will not let the reward of those who do good to go to waste.” . They said, “By Allah, Allah has favored you[37] over us, and we have surely been sinful.” . He said, “There is no blame on you today. May Allah forgive you, for He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.","[35] He provided them with a face-saving excuse by saying that they were ignorant for what they did. . [36] Joseph made the point that he and also his brother underwent a good turn of fortune after oppression. . [37] Finally, they admitted that he was the ‘favored one’."
12,93,96,"He [Joseph] asked them about his father; and they told him that his eyesight had gone. And so 
he said: Go with this shirt of mine — and this was the shirt of Abraham, the one he wore when he was 
thrown into the fire; he [Joseph] had it around his neck when he was at the bottom of the well. It [the 
shirt] had come from Paradise: Gabriel commanded him [Joseph] to send it off [to Jacob] saying that the 
scent of Paradise lingers in it, and whenever it is ca£t upon a sufferer, it heals him — and lay it on my 
father’s face, and he will recover his sight; and bring me all your folk’. And as the caravan set forth, leaving behind the palm fields of Egypt, their father said, to those 
of his sons and their children present, ‘Truly I sense the scent of Joseph — which the easT wind had 
brought to him, with God’s permission, across a distance of three or eight or more days’ journey; if only

you did not think me doting’, [if only] you [did not] regard me as foolish, you would believe me. They said, to him: ‘By God, you are certainly in your misguidance, your error, of old’, in your 
excessive adoration of him, and your [enduring] hope of encountering him [again] de^Jhte the length of 
time [that has passed]. Then, when (fa-lamma an: an is extra) the bearer of good tidings, Judah, came, with the shirt — 
he had [been the one who] brought the blood-stained shirt, and so now he wished to bring him joy, after 
he had [previously] brought him grief — he laid it, he cast the shirt, on his face and he regained his sight. 
He said, ‘Did I not say to you, “Indeed I know from God what you do not know?” ’","Take this shirt of mine and throw it over my father’s face; he will recover his sight. Then come back to me with all of your family.” . When the caravan set out [from Egypt], their father said, “I certainly sense the fragrance of Joseph, even though you might think that I am senile.” . They said, “By Allah, you are still lost in your old delusion.” . Then when the bearer of the glad tidings came, he threw it[38] over his face, and he immediately recovered his sight. He said, “Did I not tell you that I know from Allah what you do not know?”","[38] i.e., Joseph's shirt."
12,97,101,"They said, ‘O our father, ask forgiveness for us of our sins; truly we have been sinful’. He said, ‘Assuredly I shall ask forgiveness for you of my Lord. LolHe is the Forgiving, theMer- 
ciful’: he [Jacob] put off this [plea of forgiveness] until [the laSt hour] before dawn, in order to be closer 
to [the likelihood of] it being accepted, or [he put it off] until the eve of Friday. They then departed for 
Egypt, where Joseph and the senior courtiers came out to meet them. And when they entered to Joseph, in his tent, 15 he took his parents, his father and his mother — 
or [and] his maternal aunt 16 — into his arms, and said, to them: ‘Enter into Egypt, if God will, in safety’, 
and they entered, and Joseph sat down on his throne. 17 And he raised his parents, he seated them next to him, upon the throne, and they fell down, 
that is, his parents and brothers, prostrating before him — a prostration that was [actually] a bowing 
down, not placing their foreheads down [on the ground]; this was their Standard [form of] greeting at 
that time. Then he said, ‘O father, this is the interpretation of my vision of old. Indeed my Lord has 
made it true. And indeed He has been gracious to me, since He brought me out of the prison — he did 
not say ‘out of the well’, in [a show of] magnanimity, leSt his brothers feel ashamed — and has brought 
you from the desert after Satan had incited ill feeling, made trouble, between me and my brethren. 
Tridy my Lord is Subtle in [bringing about] what He will. Truly He is the Knower, IS of His creatures, the 
Wise, in His acftions. His father [Jacob] remained with him for 24 years, or for 17 years. The duration of 
his separation [from Joseph] had been 18, or 40, or 80 years. When death approached him, he charged 
Joseph to take him and bury him by his father [Isaac], and so he [Joseph] himself went and buried him 
there. He [Joseph] then returned to Egypt and remained [alive] for another 23 years. When he was nearing his end, realising that he would not remain [alive] forever, he longed for 
the everlasting kingdom and said: My Lord, indeed You have given me [something] of sovereignty and 
You have taught me the interpretation of events, the ability to explain dreams. Originator, Creator, of 
the heavens and the earth! You are my Protestor, Guardian of my be St interests, in this world and the 
Hereafter. Take me [in death] to You in submission [to You] and join me to the righteous’, from among 
my fathers. He lived after that for another week or more. He died at the age of 120 years. The Egyptians 
were very covetous with regard to his grave; [eventually] they placed him in a marble coffin and buried 
him at the top of the Nile so that both banks would be blessed [by his body] — Glory be to the One 
Whose Kingdom never ends. 19","They said, “O our father, pray to Allah to forgive us our sins; we were certainly mistaken.” . He said, “I will ask my Lord to forgive you, for He is the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.” . When they came into Joseph’s presence, he embraced his parents and said, “Enter Egypt, if Allah wills, safe and secure. . He took his parents to the throne, and they all fell down in prostration[39] before him. He said, “O my father, this is the interpretation of my old dream. My Lord has made it come true. He was kind to me when He freed me from prison and brought you all here from the wilderness after Satan caused a rift between me and my brothers. My Lord is gracious to whom He wills. Indeed, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.” . “My Lord, You have given me authority and taught me something of the interpretation of dreams. O Originator of the heavens and earth, You are my Protector in this world and in the Hereafter. Cause me to die as a Muslim [submitting to You], and join me with the righteous[40].”","[39] That of greeting and respect, not of worship, which was permissible before the time of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). . [40] By the ‘righteous’ ones Joseph meant his forefathers Isaac and Abraham and all other prophets and messengers."
12,102,107,"That, which is mentioned of the matter of Joseph, is of the tidings, the tales, of the Unseen, what 
has been hidden from you O Muhammad (s), which We reveal to you; for you were not with them, with 
Josephs brothers, when they agreed upon their plan, to plot againSt him, that is, [when] they resolved 
upon it, and schemed, against him; in other words, you were not present among them to know their Story

city; see Ibn Kathir, Qisas, 251.

17 The term sarir is synonymous here with ' arsh , ‘throne’; see next verse. 

18 Most translations of the Qur’an render latifi as ‘gentle’ or ‘tender’; but this misses the point of Joseph’s remark, the force of which 
is that although believers might be at a loss to explain unexpected turns of fortune, with time they will come to see such events as 
the unfolding of the divine will: God’s providence for believers is ‘subtle’.

and so tell it to others: knowledge of it has come to you through revelation. Yet, mo ft people, that is, the people of Mecca, however eager you might be, that they believe, 
will not believe. Nor do you ask them any wage, that you should take, for it, that is, [for] the Qur’an — it, 
namely, the Qur’an, is but a reminder, an admonition, to all the worlds. And how many a sign, indicating the Oneness of God, is there in the heavens and the earth 
which they pass by, which they witness, but disregard!, not reflecting upon it. And moSt of them do not believe in God, such that they might affirm that He is the Creator 
and the Sustain er, without ascribing partners, to Him, by worshipping idols; which is why, when crying 
their [ritual] re,<]ionse to God, they used to say: ‘At Your service, no partner have You, save a partner that 
belongs to You; You possess him and all that he possesses’, meaning it [when they said it]. 20 Do they deem themselves secure from the coming upon them of a pall, a calamity enveloping 
them, of God’s chastisement, or the coming of the Hour upon them suddenly, while they are unaware?, 
of the time of its arrival beforehand?","That is from the stories of the unseen which We reveal to you [O Prophet]; you were not with them when they agreed upon their plan as they were plotting. . But most people will not believe, no matter how eager you may be. . You are not asking them for any reward. It is only a reminder to the worlds. . How many signs there are in the heavens and earth which they pass by without paying them any heed! . And most of them do not believe in Allah except that they associate partners with Him. . Do they feel secure that an overwhelming punishment from Allah will not overtake them, or that the Hour will not come upon them by surprise when they least expect it?",
12,108,111,"Say, to them: ‘This is my way — which He explains by saying: I call to, the religion of, God, 
being upon sure knowledge, plain proof, I and whoever follows me, [whoever] believes in me ( man 
ittabaani is a supplement to and, T, the subject, predicated by what preceded [sc. ‘being upon sure 
knowledge’]). So Glory be to God!, [in affirmation] of His being exalted high above having partners, and 
I am not of the idolaters’ — this [sentence] is also subsumed by the [explanation of] his statement about 
‘his way’. 21 And We did not send before you [any messengers] save men inspired by revelation ( yuha ilay- 
him : a variant reading has nil hi ilayhim, ‘to whom We revealed’) — and not angels — from among the 
people of the towns, the principal towns, since they are more knowledgeable and wiser than the people 
of the desert, who are crude and ignorant. Have they, the people of Mecca, not travelled in the land and 
seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them?, that is, how they ended up, when 
they were destroyed for denying their messengers? And verily the abode of the Hereafter, that is, Para¬ 
dise, is better for those who are wary, of God. Will they not understand? (read a-fa-ld ya’qilun, or a-fa-ld 
taqilun. ‘Will you not understand?’), this, O people of Mecca, and so have faith? Until ( hatta indicates the end [result] indicated by [the previous Statement] wa-ma arsalna min

Our wrath. Our chastisement, cannot be averted from the sinning, the idolatrous, folk. Verily there is in their Stories, that is, the messengers’ [Stories], a lesson for people of pith, pos¬ 
sessors of intellect. It, this Qur’an, is not a fabricated, an invented, discourse but, it is, a confirmation 
of what was [revealed] before it, of scriptures, and a detailing, an elucidation, of everything, that one

Until when the messengers lost all hope and realized that they were dismissed as liars, Our help came to them, so We saved whom We willed, and Our punishment cannot be averted from the wicked people. . In their stories there is truly a lesson for people of understanding. This [Qur’an] is not a fabricated tale, rather a confirmation of what came before it, a detailed explanation of everything, a guidance and mercy for people who believe.","[41] i.e., Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)."
13,1,4,"Aliflam mim ra : God knows be£t what He means by these [letters]. Those, these verses, are the 
verses of the Book, the Qur’an (the genitive annexation carries the meaning of [partitive] min, ‘from’), 3 
and that which has been revealed to you from your Lord, namely, the Qur’an (this [preceding sentence] 
constitutes the subjecft, the predicate of which is [the following]), is the Truth, wherein is no doubt, but 
moSt people, that is, the people of Mecca, do not believe, that it is from God, exalted be He. God is He Who raised up the heavens without visible supports (‘amad is the plural oVimad, which 
is [the same as] an ustuwdna, ‘a column; and this [Statement] is true, since there are no aCtual supports) 
then presided upon the Throne, a presiding befitting Him, and disposed, made subservient, the sun and 
the moon, each one, of them, moving, along its course, until [ the conclusion of] an appointed time, that 
is, [until] the Day of Resurrection. He directs the command, He conducts the affairs of His Kingdom. He 
details. He expounds, the signs, the indications of His power, so that you, O people of Mecca, might be 
certain of the encounter with your Lord, through resurrection. And He it is Who spread out, extended [flat], the earth and set, created, therein firm mountains 
and rivers, and of every fruit He has made in it two kinds, of every Species. He covers, He cloaks, the 
night, and its darkness, with the day. Surely in that, which is mentioned, are signs, indications of His 
Oneness, exalted be He, for a people who refled, upon God’s handiwork. And on the earth are trails, diverse terrains, neighbouring each other, joined side by side, some 
good, some briny, some of little yield and some fruitful — and these constitute proofs of His power, 
exalted be He — and gardens, orchards, of vines and sown fields (read zarun, in the nominative, as a 
supplement to janndtun, ‘gardens’, or read zarin, in the genitive, [as a supplement] to anabin, ‘of vines’); 
similarly [constituting proofs of His power are] His words: and date-palms sharing one root ( sinwan

[some of them] to excel’) others in flavour (read fi’l-ukul or fil-ukl): and so some are sweet, others, bitter 
— and these are [also] proofs of His power, exalted be He. Surely in that, which is mentioned, are signs 
for a people who understand, [who] reflect.","Alif Lām Mīm Ra[1]. These are the verses of the Book. That which has been sent down to you [O Prophet] from your Lord is the truth, but most people do not believe. . It is Allah Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see, and then He rose over the Throne[2]. He subjected the sun and the moon, each running its course for an appointed term. He governs all affairs, and explains the signs in detail, so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord. . It is He Who spread out the earth and placed therein firm mountains and rivers, and created therein fruits of every kind in pairs. He causes the night to cover the day. Indeed, there are signs in this for people who reflect. . And on the earth there are neighboring [yet different] tracts of land, and gardens of grapevines, grains and palm trees – some growing in clusters from one root or standing alone.

of the Fire, abiding therein. The following was revealed regarding their hastening on, out of mockery, of the chastisement: And 
they would have you hasten on the evil, the chastisement, rather than the good, [rather than] mercy, 
when there have indeed occurred before them exemplary punishments ( mathulat is the plural of math- 
ula, similar [in pattern] to samura [pi. samurdt], acacia), that is to say, the punishments of disbelievers 
like them: will they not take warning from these? Truly your Lord is forgiving to mankind despite their 
evil-doing, for otherwise He would not have left a single creature on the face of it [the earth]; and truly 
your Lord is severe in retribution, againSt those who disobey Him. And those who disbelieve say, ‘Why has not some sign been sent down upon him, upon Muhammad 
( s),from his Lord!’, the like of the Staff and the [glowing] hand, 4 or the she-camel. 5 God, exalted be He, 
says: You are only a Warner, one to threaten the disbelievers, for it is not your duty to bring forth signs; 
and for every folk there is a guide, a prophet, to guide them to their Lord with the signs that He gives 
him, and not what with they request.","If you wonder, then wondrous is their saying, “What! When we become dust, will we be created anew?” They are the ones who disbelieve in their Lord, and they are the ones who will have shackles around their necks. Such are the people of the Fire; they will abide therein forever. . They ask you [O Prophet] to hasten the punishment before the good[3], even though there have already been similar punishments before them. But your Lord is indeed forgiving to people despite their wrongdoing, and your Lord is indeed severe in punishment. . The disbelievers say, “Why has no sign[4] been sent down to him from his Lord?” You are only a warner, and for every people there is a guide.","[3] This shows the utter disregard towards the Message. . [4] i.e., a miracle."
13,8,11,"God knows what every female bears, of male or female, one or more, and otherwise, and what 
the wombs reduce, of the time of geStation, and what they increase, of it. And everything with Him is 
according to a [precise] measure, a [precise] amount and limit which it does not exceed; [He is] the Knower of the unseen and the visible, [of] what is hidden and what is witnessed; the 
Great, the Tremendous, the High Exalted, above His creation, through His [overpowering] subjugation 
(read al-muta’ali or al-muta’al, ‘the High Exalted’). [They are all] the same, according to His knowledge, exalted be He, those of you who fpeak 
secretly and those who do so openly, and those who lurk, [who] hide themselves, in the night, in its dark¬

Indeed God does not alter the Hate of a people — He does not deprive them of His grace — unless they 
have altered the Hate of their souls, from [their] comely nature, through an acft of disobedience. And if 
God wills misfortune, chastisement, for a people there is none that can repel it, either from among the 
attendant angels or others; and they, for whom God wills misfortune, have no protestor ( min wdlin: min 
is extra) to avert it from them, apart from Him, that is, other than God.","Allah knows what every female bears[5], and what the wombs may fall short or increase[6]. With Him everything is precisely measured. . He is the Knower of the unseen and the seen, the All-Great, the Most Exalted. . It is the same [to Him] whether one of you speaks secretly or in public, and whether one is hidden in the darkness of the night or walks about openly in the daylight. . For each person there are successive angels[7] in front of him and behind him, guarding him by the command of Allah. Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change their own attitude and conduct[8]. But if Allah intends punishment for a people[9], then it cannot be averted, nor will there be any protector for them besides Him.","[5] Human and otherwise, during pregnancy.

He will, such that it burns [that person]: this was revealed regarding a man to whom the Prophet (s) had 
sent someone to invite [to Islam] and who said, ‘Who is the Messenger of God? And what is God? Is He 
[made] of gold, or of silver, or of copper?’, whereupon a thunderbolt came down on him and blew off the 
top of his head; yet they, that is, the disbelievers, dispute, argue with the Prophet (s), about God, though 
He is great in might, in power, or in [the severity of His] retribution.","It is He Who shows you lightening [causing] fear and hope[10] and forms heavy clouds[11]. . The thunder glorifies His praise, and so do the angels in awe of Him. He sends thunderbolts, striking therewith whom He wills, yet they dispute about Allah, Who is severe in might.","[10] “Fear” of being hit by thunderbolt and “hope” for getting rain.

are: ‘there is no god but God’ (Id ildha illd’Lldh); and those upon whom they call (read yad'im or tad‘un, 
‘you call’), [those whom] they worship, apart from Him, that is, other than Him — namely, the idols —

the well to [reach] him, but it would never reach it, that is, [reach] his mouth, ever: likewise they [the 
idols] will not answer them; and the call of the disbelievers, their worship of idols — or their acftual sup¬ 
plication — goes only aStray, [it is only] in perdition. And to God prostrate whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly, such as believers, or 
unwillingly, such as hypocrites and those coerced by the sword, and their shadows also, prostrate, in the 
mornings and the evenings. Say, O Muhammad (s), to your people: ‘Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?’ Say: 
‘God’ — and even if they do not say it, there can be no other reponse. Say, to them: ‘Then have you 
taken beside Him, other than Him, protestors, idols, to worship, who have no power to benefit or harm 
themselves?’, and you abandon the One Who is their Possessor? (an interrogative meant as a rebuke). 
Say: ‘Are the blind one and the seer, [repetitively], the disbeliever and the believer, equal? Or are dark¬ 
ness, disbelief, and the light, faith, equal? No! Or have they set up for God associates who have created 
the like of His creation, so that creation seems alike, that is, [is] what the associates create and the 
creation of God [alike], to them?’, so that they believe them worthy of being worshipped on account of 
what these [associates] have created? (an interrogative of disavowal); in other words, not so! None save 
the Creator is worthy of being worshipped. Say: ‘God is the Creator of all things, having no associate 
therein, and so He cannot have an associate in terms of worship; and He is the One, the Subjugator’, of 
His servants. He then strikes a similitude of truth and falsehood, saying: He, exalted be He, sends down water, 
rain, from the sky, whereat the valleys flow according to their measure, according to their full capacity, 
and the flood carries a scum that swells, rising above it, and this [scum] is the filth and the like that lies 
on the surface of the earth, and from that which they smelt (read tuqidun, ‘you smelt’, or yuqidun, ‘they 
smelt’) in the fire, of the earth’s minerals, such as gold, silver or copper, desiring, seeking [to make], 
ornaments, adornment, or ware, which is useful, such as utensils, when they [the minerals] are melted; 
[there rises] a scum the like of it, that is, the like of the scum of the flood, and this [latter scum] consists 
of the impurities expelled by the bellows. Thus, in the way mentioned, God points out truth and false¬ 
hood, that is, [He points out] the similitude thereof. As for the scum, of the flood and of the minerals 
smelted, it passes away as dross, useless refuse, while that which is of use to mankind, in the way of wa¬ 
ter and minerals, lingers, remains, in the earth, for a time: likewise, falsehood wanes and is [eventually] 
effaced, even if it should prevail over the truth at certain times. Truth, on the other hand, is established 
and enduring. Thus, in the way mentioned, God Strikes, He makes clear, similitudes.","To Him alone should all supplication be addressed[12]. But those whom they supplicate besides Him do not respond to them in any way, except like one who stretches out his hands for water to reach his mouth, but it will never reach it[13]. The supplication of the disbelievers is all in vain. . To Allah prostrates[14] whoever is in the heavens and on earth, willingly or unwillingly, and so do their shadows in the morning and evening. . Say, “Who is the Lord of the heavens and earth?” Say, “Allah.” Say, “Have you taken besides Him protectors, those who have no power to benefit or harm themselves[15]?” Say, “Can the blind person be equal to the seeing[16], or can the darkness be equal to the light?” Or do they ascribe to Allah partners who created the like of His creation[17], so they are confused between two creations? Say, “Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Subjugator.” . He sends down rain from the sky, causing the valleys to flow, each according to its capacity, and the torrent carries along rising foam, similar to the slag produced from metal that people melt in the fire to make ornaments or tools. This is how Allah compares truth to falsehood: as for the residue, it is then cast away, but that which benefits people remains on the earth[18]. This is how Allah sets forth comparisons.","[12] i.e., the testimony of faith (There is no true god but Allah).
 [13] The analogy indicates that false deities will never respond to them. . [14] There are two types of prostrations: sujūd shar‘i (Intentional prostration) and sujūd qadari (Unintentional prostration). See also 3:83. . [15] The claimed partners cannot be compared to Allah in any way.
 [16] Disbelievers are ‘blind’ to the Truth and the believers can see the Truth plainly as it is.
 [17] Their so-called ‘gods’ could not answer their prayers or do them good or harm, let alone perform such a great act as that of creation. . [18] Truth is the water that stays and people benefit from it, whereas falsehood is the scum that soon dissolves and disappears; likewise is the slag of minerals."

be the goodly reward. Paradise, and those who do not respond to Him, namely the disbelievers — if they 
possessed all that is in the earth, and therewith the like of it, they would offer it to redeem themselves

be requited for every single thing they did, none of which will be forgiven, and their abode shall be Hell,

know it, nor believes in it? No! But only people of pith, possessors of intellect, remember, heed [such 
admonitions]; such asfidfil God’s covenant, [meaning] the one that was taken from them while they were Still

whomever He will; and they, the people of Mecca, rejoice, a wanton rejoicing, in the life of this world, 
that is, in what they acquire therein, yet the life of this world, in, comparison with the life of, the Hereaf¬

themselves to Him, they said, ‘And what is the Compassionate One?’ Say, to them, O Muhammad (s): 
‘He is my Lord; there is no god save Him. In Him I truCt and to Him is my recourse’. The following was revealed when they said to him, ‘If you are [truly] a prophet, then make these

sow seeds, and resurrect for us our dead fathers to SJieak to us and tell us that you are a prophet’: Even

were cleft, torn, or the dead were spoken to, such that they would respond, 7 they still would not believe. 8 
Nay, but the affair belongs entirely to God, and none other, so that none believes except he whom He 
wills that he believes, and no other; even if they were given what they request [of signs]. The following 
was revealed when the Companions were keen that what was requested [of signs] should be manifested, 
hoping that they [the ones requesting them] might believe: Have they not realised, those who believe, 
that (an is softened, in other words [understand it as] annahu ) had God willed, He could have guided 
all mankind?, to faith, without [the need for] any sign? And the disbelievers, from among the people 
of Mecca, continue to be struck by devastation, a catastrophe that devastates them through all manner 
of hardship, such as being killed, taken captive, and [suffering] war or drought, because of what they 
wrought, because of their actions, that is, their disbelief; or you alight, O Muhammad (s), together with 
your army, near their home — Mecca — until God’s promise, of victory againSt them, comes to pass; 
truly God does not break His promise-, and indeed, he alighted at Hudaybiyya until the conquest of 
Mecca took place; messengers were certainly mocked before you, in the same way that you have been mocked — 
this is meant as solace for the Prophet (s) — but I gave respite to those who disbelieved; then I seized 
them, with retribution, and how was My retribution?, that is to say, it [My retribution] will come to pass; 
and I shall deal with those who have mocked you in the same way. 

[1.3:33] Is He Who Stands, watches, over every soul what it has earned?, what it has done of good or 
evil — and this is God — like the idols who are not so? No! This [re^onse] is suggested by [the follow¬ 
ing words]: Yet they ascribe to God associates. Say: ‘Name them!, for Him: who are they? Or will you 
inform Him, will you inform God, of something, that is, of an associate, which He does not know in the 
earth? (an interrogative of disavowal); in other words, He has no associate, for if He did, He would know 
him — exalted be He above such a thing. Or is it — nay — you call them associates, merely [a manner 
of] Speaking?’, that is, [it is merely] on the basis of false conjecture, without any truth in it. Nay, but their 
scheming, their unbelief, has been adorned for those who disbelieve and they have been barred from the 
way, [from] the path of guidance; and whomever God sends aStray, for him there is no guide.  For them there is chastisement in the life of this world, through being killed or taken captive; 
and verily the chastisement of the Hereafter is more grievous, is more severe; and they have no de¬ 
fender, proteCtor, from God, that is, from His chastisement.","Thus did We send you to a community before which other communities had passed away, so that you may recite to them what We have revealed to you, yet they disbelieve in the Most Compassionate. Say, “He is my Lord; none has the right to be worshiped except Him. In Him I put my trust, and to Him is my return.” . Even if there were a Qur’an that could cause mountains to move[26], or split the earth, or cause the dead to speak, [they would still not believe]. To Allah belongs all matters. Do the believers not know that if Allah had willed, He could have guided all humans? Calamities will continue to befall the disbelievers or strike close to their homes because of their deeds, until the promise of Allah comes to pass, for Allah does not fail in His promise. . There were messengers before you who were ridiculed, but I gave respite to those who disbelieved, then I seized them[27]. How [terrible] was My chastisement! . Is He Who watches every soul in whatever it does [like others]? Yet they ascribe partners to Allah. Say, “Name them! Or do you presume to inform Him of something that He does not know on earth, or it is just a show of words?” No, but the falsehood of the disbelievers is made appealing to them, and they are hindered from the [straight] path. Whoever Allah causes to stray, he will have none to guide. . They will be punished in this life, but the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe, and they will have no protector against Allah.","[26] “Had We sent down this Qur’an upon a mountain, you would have seen it humbled and break asunder out of awe of Allah!” See 59:21. .

them; and it was not for any Messenger, from among them, that he should bring a sign, save by God’s 
leave, because they are servants enthralled [by Him]. For every term, period, there is a Book, wherein 
is inscribed its delimitation. God effaces, of it [the Book], whatever He will and He fixes (read yuthbit or yuthabbit), therein 
whatever He will of rulings or other matters, and with Him is the Mother of the Book, its [source of] ori¬ 
gin, of which nothing is ever changed, and which consists of what He inscribed in pre-eternity ( azal ). And whether ([read as] imma: the nun of the conditional particle in, ‘whether’, has been assimili-

your lifetime (the response of the conditional Statement has been omitted, in other words [understand it

to convey [the Message], your duty is only to deliver [the Message], and it is for Us to do the reckoning, 
when they finally come to Us, whereupon We shall requite them. Or is it that they, the people ofMecca, have not seen how We visit the land, [how] We target their 
land, diminishing it at its outlying regions?, by giving victory to the Prophet (s). And God judges, among 
His creatures as He will; there is none that can repel His judgement and He is swift at reckoning. And indeed those that were before them, of communities, plotted, againSt their prophets juSt as 
they plot againSt you; but to God belongs all plotting. And nor is their plotting like the plotting of God, 
for, exalted be He, He knows what every soul earns, and so its requital is prepared for it, and this is the 
ultimate plotting, since He brings it to them whence they are not aware. The disbeliever (the genus is 
meant here; a variant reading has kuffar [‘the disbelievers’]) shall assuredly know for whom shall be the 
sequel of the [heavenly] Abode, that is, the praiseworthy sequel in the abode of the Hereafter: will it be 
theirs or that of the Prophet (s) and his Companions? And those who disbelieve say, to you: ‘You have not been sent [by God]!’ Say, to them: ‘God

them. 

[ 14:9] Has there not come to you (an interrogative meant as an affirmative) the tidings, the news, of those 
who were before you — the people of Noah, and c Ad — the people of Hud — and Thamud — the people 
of Salih — and those after them? None knows them save God. [This is] on account of their multitude. 
Their messengers brought them clear signs, with lucid arguments demonstrating their truthfulness; but 
they, that is, the communities, thruSt their hands into their mouths, to bite on them, out of extreme SJute, 
and said, ‘Lot we disbelieve in that wherewith you have been sent, according to what you claim, and lo! 
we are in grave doubt concerning that to which you call us’, [doubt] creating [great] uncertainty. 


Sura Ibrahim","We sent Moses with Our signs [saying], “Bring your people out of the depths of darkness into the light, and remind them of Allah’s days[4]. Indeed, there are signs in this for every patient and grateful person. . And [remember] when Moses said to his people, “Remember Allah’s favor upon you when He saved you from Pharaoh’s people who were inflicting upon you the worst torment, slaughtering your sons and keeping your women alive; that was a great trial from your Lord. . And [remember] when your Lord declared, ‘If you are grateful, I will surely give you more; but if you are ungrateful, My punishment is severe indeed.’” . And Moses said, “If you and all those who are on earth were to disbelieve, indeed Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.”","[4] i.e., days of favors upon the Children of Israel, or days of destruction of the former nations."
14,9,12," Their messengers said, ‘Can there be doubt concerning God (an interrogative meant as a de¬ 
nial), in other words, there can be no doubt concerning His Oneness, given the manifest proofs of it, the 
Originator, the Creator, of the heavens and the earth? He calls you, to obedience of Him, so that He 
might forgive you your sins (min dhunubikum-. min is extra, since through submission [to the One God] 
all that may have been committed previously is forgiven (or else it [min, ‘some of’] is partitive, intended 
to £tate that [forgiveness] which is due to [Gods] servants) 1 and defer you, without chastisement, to an 
appointed term’, the term of death. They said, ‘You are but mortals like us, desiring to bar us from that 
which our fathers used to worship, in the way of idols. So bring us a clear warrant’, a manifest argument 
demonstrating your truthfulness. Their messengers said to them, ‘We are but mortals like you, as you have said; but God is gra¬ 
cious to whomever He will of His servants, by way of [assigning] prophethood. And it is not ours to 
bring you any warrant save by the leave of God, by His command, for we are servants, enthralled; and 
in God let believers put their trull, [let them] have confidence in Him. 

[ 14:12] And why, indeed, should we not put our truft in God, in other words, there is nothing to prevent 
us from [doing] this, when He has guided us our ways? And we shall surely endure the hurt you do us. 
And in God let the trusting put their truft’. ","Have there not come to you the stories of those who came before you – the people of Noah, ‘Ād and Thamūd, and those who came after them? No one knows them except Allah. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they shoved their hands into their mouths[5] and said, “We disbelieve in what you are sent with, and we surely doubt what you are calling us to.” . Their messengers said, “Can there be any doubt about Allah, the Creator of the heavens and earth? He calls you so that He may forgive some of your sins, and give you respite for an appointed term.” They said, “You are but humans like us! You want to turn us away from what our forefathers used to worship; then bring us a clear proof.” . Their messengers said to them, “We are no more than human beings like you, but it is Allah Who bestows His favor upon whom He wills of His slaves. It is not for us to bring you proof except with Allah’s permission, and in Allah let the believers put their trust. . Why should we not put our trust in Allah, and it is He Who has guided us to our ways? We will surely be patient against whatever harm you cause us. And in Allah let the faithful put their trust.”",[5] as a gesture of denial and rejection.
14,13,18,"And those who disbelieved said to their messengers, ‘We will assuredly expel you from our land, 
or you will surely return, you will [surely] end up [returning], to our creed’, our religion. Then their 
Lord infpired them [saying]: ‘We shall surely deftroy the evildoers, the disbelievers, and We shall surely make you dwell in the land, their land, after them, after they have been destroyed 
— that, vicftory [over them] and bequeSt of the land [to you] is, for whoever fears the ftanding before Me, that 
is, [whoever fears] when he comes to Stand before Me, and fears My threat’, of chastisement. And they sought viflory, the messengers sought assistance from God againSt their people; and 
every tyrant, disdaining obedience to God, rebellious, obstinate to the truth, was brought to nothing; beyond him, that is, in front of him, is Hell, which he will enter, and he is given to drink, in it, 
offeftering fluid — which is what issues out of the insides of the people of the Fire, mixed with pus and 
blood — which he sips, gulping it repeatedly, because of its acridity, but can scarcely swallow, [scarcely] 
ingeSt because it is so foul and disgusting; and death, that is, those causes of it that necessarily bring it 
about, in the way of [different] types of chastisement, comes to him from every side, yet he cannot die; 
and flill beyond him, after that chastisement, there is a harsh chaftisement, a severe one, following on 
[from the previous one]. The likeness, the description, of those who disbelieve in their Lord ( alladhina kafaru bi-rabbi- 
him\ the subject, substituted by [the following, amdluhum,]): their works, the righteous ones, such as 
kindness [to kin] or an acft of charity — in the way that no benefit can be derived from them [it is because 
these works] — are as ashes over which the wind blows hard on a tempeftuous day, one in which the 
winds blow violently, making them as scattered duSt, over which none can have power (the genitive 
[clause beginning with ka-ramadin, ‘as ashes’] constitutes the predicate of the [above-mentioned] sub¬ 
ject!:); they, that is, the disbelievers, have no power over anything that they have earned, [anything] that 
they had done in [their] life on earth, in other words, they shall find no reward for it, since this was never 
a precondition. 2 That is extreme error, [extreme] perdition! 

1 In other words, if the min is extra then it is that God calls them to obedience of Him in order to forgive them all previous sins. 
If it is not extra, then it muft be partitive and so what is meant is that God shall forgive them those sins which they might commit 
once they have submitted to Him, since through good deeds and iftighfar, Gods forgiveness becomes due to His servants (huquq 
al-'ibdd) — whereas before He might not have forgiven them anything. 

2 The precondition for being rewarded in the Hereafter for ones righteous deeds on earth is that one believes in God and the 
Hereafter. Since disbelievers have no such beliefs, the reward for whatever righteous deeds they might perform is re&ridted to the 
life of this world (cf. Q. 11:15-16, Q. 92:19-20).

Tafsir al-Jalalayn","The disbelievers said to their messengers, “We will surely drive you out of our land unless you return to our religion.” Their Lord then inspired them, “We will certainly destroy the wrongdoers, . and We will make you dwell in the land after them.

Hell awaits him, and he will be made to drink of oozing pus, . which he will arduously sip but can hardly swallow it, and death will come to him from every direction, yet he will not die.

14,24,27,"Have you not seen, observed, how God has Struck a similitude? ( mathalan is substituted by [the 
following words, kalimatan tayyibatan ]): a goodly saying, which is, ‘there is no god but God’, is as a 
goodly tree, a palm tree, its root set firm, in the ground, and its shoots, its branches, are in heaven; it gives its produce, its fruit, every season by the leave of its Lord, by His will. Similarly, the words 
of faith are set firm in the heart of the believer; his works are raised up to heaven and he receives the 
blessings and reward therefrom all the time. And God Strikes, He makes clear, similitudes for mankind, 
so that they might remember, be admonished, and therefore believe. And the similitude of a bad saying, that is, the word of unbelief, is as a bad tree, a colocynth, 
uprooted from upon the earth, having no Stability, [no] fixing or foundation. Similarly, the word of 
unbelief has no foundation, and no shoot or blessing. God confirms those who believe by a firm saying, namely, the profession of [His] Oneness, in 
the life of this world and in the Hereafter, that is, in the grave, when the two angels question them about 
their Lord, their religion and their Prophet, and they respond correCtly, as [reported] in the hadith of 
the two Shaykhs [al-Bukharl and Muslim]; and God sends aStray the evildoers, the disbelievers, and 
therefore they are not guided to the correct response, saying instead, ‘We do not know’, as [reported] in 
the hadith; and God does what He will.","Do you not see how Allah compares a good word[12] to a good tree[13]? Its root is firm and its branches reach the sky[14], . yielding its fruit all the times[15], by the permission of its Lord. Allah makes such comparisons for people, so that they may take heed. . But an evil word[16] is like an evil tree[17], uprooted from the surface of the earth, having no stability. . Allah keeps those who believe steadfast with the firm Word [of faith] in the life of this world[18] and in the Hereafter. But Allah causes to stray the wrongdoers[19]; Allah does whatever He wills.","[12] i.e., the testimony of faith.

[15] i.e., day and night, summer and winter; likewise is the testimony of faith, it never ceases to yield good deeds all the time. . [16] i.e., the word of disbelief and polytheism.
 [17] i.e., the tree of colocynth; it has no stable root and its stalks are so feeble; such is disbelief which is shaky in the heart, and their deeds are not raised to benefit them in the Hereafter. . [18] When questioned in their graves by the angels.

was because al-Ta’if, located as it is up in the mountains, had a much better climate than Mecca. Moreover, the district of al-Ta’if 
itself was very fertile and crops such as cereals and raisins were consumed there, while Meccans had to make do mainly with dates 
and milk (cf. W. M. Watt, Muhammad at Mecca, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1953), 138). Among the traditions relating to

the requital thereof [is with God], and their plotting, even though it be great, was not such whereby 
mountains should be moved, meaning that it is not of any importance, but that they are only harming 
themselves thereby. It is said that the use of ‘mountains’ here is meant to be literal; alternatively, it is also

are established and fixed (a variant reading has la-tazulu [instead of li-tazula], with in softened [from 
inna, ‘verily’], in which case the intended meaning is that [the extent of] their plotting is great. It is said 
that ‘plotting’ here is [actually a reference to] their unbelief. This second [reading] is consonant with 
[God’s saying]: Whereby the heavens are almost torn and the earth Split asunder and the mountains fall 
crashing [Q. 19:90b 5 according to the former [reading], however, one should read it as [if it were] wa-ma

You lived[33] in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves, and it became clear to you how We dealt with them, and We gave you examples.” .

( 5 ) was asked, “Where will people be on that day?” He said, “On the Bridge ( sirat )”’; 6 and they 
shall come forth, they shall exit from [their] graves, to God, the One, the Almighty. And you shall see, O Muhammad (s), the sinners, the disbelievers, on that day coupled, chained 
together with their [individual] devils, in chains, manacles or collars, their shirts [made] of pitch, because it ignites fire more intensely, and their faces are engulfed 
by the Fire, that God may requite ( li-yajziya is semantically connected to [the verb] barazu, ‘they shall come 
forth’) 7 every soul for what it has earned, of good and evil. Truly God is swift at reckoning — He shall 
reckon with all creatures in about half a day of the days of this world, as one hadlth states to that effedt. This, Qur’an, is a Proclamation for mankind, in other words, it was revealed in order to pro¬ 
claim to them, and so that they may be warned thereby, and that they may know, by way of the argu¬ 
ments contained in it, that He, namely, God, is One God, and that people of pith, possessors of intellect, 
may remember ( yadhdhakkara : the original ta [of yatadhakkara] has been assimilated with the dhal), 
[that they] may be admonished. 


6 Literally, ‘the Path’: this is the eschatological Bridge which muit be traversed by every individual, symbolically, as a confirmation

Meccan, consisting of 99 verses. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","Never think that Allah will fail in His promise to His messengers[36]. Allah is All-Mighty, Capable of Retribution. . The Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will the heavens[37], and all will appear before Allah, the One, the Subjugator[38]. . On that Day you will see the wicked bound together in chains[39], . their garments will be of pitch and their faces covered with Fire. . So that Allah may recompense every soul for what it did. Allah is swift in reckoning. . This [Qur’an] is a message for all mankind, so that they may be warned thereby and know that He is One God, and so that the people of understanding may take heed.","[36] i.e., that they would be given victory both in this life and in the Hereafter. . [37] Many exegetes who talk about what befalls the heavens and earth on that Day, opines that the replacement here is of the characteristics (al-sifāt), not of the quintessence (al-dhāt).
 [38] Allah’s revenge will be on the Day of Judgment. . [39] i.e., their hands and feet will be chained to their necks. See 40:70-72."
15,1,9,"Aliflam ra 3 : God knows best what He means by these [letters]. Those — these verses — are the 
verses of the Book, the Qur’an ( dyatu’l-kitdbi: this annexation functions in the sense of min, ‘from’ 1 ) and 
of a manifest Qur’an, one that makes evident what is truth and what is falsehood (wa-qur’anin mubinin 
is [made up of] a supplement with an added adjedtival qualification). It may he that (read rubbama or rubama) those who disbelieve, on the Day of Resurrection, when 
they witness their predicament and that of the Muslims, will wish that they had been muslims ( rubba 
here is used to indicate ‘many’, since many of them will wish this; but it is also said to indicate ‘few’, since 
they will be so stupefied by the terrors that they will not come out of their stupor to wish such a thing, 
except on a few occasions: Leave them, the disbelievers, O Muhammad (s), to eat and to enjoy, this world of theirs, and that 
they be diverted, dis'tratted, by hope, of a long life and other [such] matters, [that keep them] away from 
faith, for they will come to know, the sequel of their affair — this was [revealed] before the command to 
fight [them]. And We did not destroy any town ( min qaryatin: min is extra), meaning, its inhabitants, but that 
it had a known decree, a [predetermined term, after which it would be destroyed. No community (min ummatin: min is extra) can outstrip its [predetermined] term nor can they 
[seek to] delay it, [nor can they] put it off. And they, that is, the disbelievers of Mecca, say, to the Prophet (s): ‘Oyou, to whom the Remem¬ 
brance, the Qur’an — as you claim — has been revealed, lo! you are indeed possessed! Why do you not bring us the angels, if you are of the truthful?’, in saying that you are a prophet 
and that this Qur’an is from God. God, exalted be He, says: The angels do not descend ( tanazzalu: one of the two ta letters [of 
tatanazzalu] has been omitted) 2 save with the truth, with the chastisement; and then, that is, upon the 
descent of the angels with the chastisement, they [the disbelievers] would not be reprieved, [would not] 
be granted respite. Verily it is We ( nahnu emphasises the subjedt of inna, or [functions as] a separating pronoun) 
Who have revealed the Remembrance, the Qur’an, and assuredly We will preserve it, againSt substitu¬ 
tion, distortion, additions and omissions.","Alif Lām Ra[1]. These are the verses of the Book and a clear Qur’an. . The disbelievers will soon[2] wish that they were Muslims. . Let them eat and enjoy themselves and be diverted with false hope; they will come to know. . We never destroyed any town except that it had a destined time. . No nation can advance its appointed time, nor can they delay it. . They say, “O you to whom the Reminder has been sent down, You are surely insane[3]! . Why do you not bring us the angels, if you are truthful?” . We do not send down the angels except for a just cause, and then [the disbelievers] would be granted no respite[4]. . It is We Who have sent down the Reminder[5], and it is We Who will preserve it[6].","[1] See footnote 2:1. . [2] On the Judgment Day or upon their death. . [3] These deriding remarks were very hard on the Prophet (ﷺ), and Allah consoles him in this surah. . [4] i.e., then they would be destroyed on the spot. . [5] As a reminder for people.
 [6] From distortion, alteration, addition, and omission. More than 1400 years have elapsed and not a single word of this Qur’an has been changed, although enemies have tried their utmost."

people have mocked you — this is meant to comfort the Prophet (s). Thus We cause it to find its way, in other words, in the same way that We have caused denial 
to enter the hearts of those [individuals], We cause it to enter, into the hearts of the sinners, that is, the 
disbelievers of Mecca. They do not believe in him, in the Prophet (s), even though the example of the men of old has

already gone before , 3 that is, the way of God [in dealing] with them [those of old], by chastising them for 
denying [the truthfulness of] their prophets: those [Meccans] are like these former. And even if We were to open for them a gate from the heaven, and they were to continue ascend¬ 
ing through it, the gate, they would say, ‘It is merely that our eyes have been dazzled, they have been shut. Nay, we are 
a folk bewitched!’, imagining this.","We did send messengers before you among the factions of early peoples. . No messenger came to them except that they ridiculed him. . This is how We let this [denial] enter the hearts of the wicked[7]. . They will not believe in it, although the examples of the earlier people are well established. . Even if We were to open for them a gateway to the heaven, through which they kept ascending, . they would still say, “Our eyes have been dazzled; rather, we have been bewitched.”",[7] For they rebelled against the Truth and did not submit to it.

Mercury: Gemini and Virgo, the Moon: Cancer, the Sun: Leo, Jupiter: Sagittarius and Pisces, and Saturn: 
Capricorn and Aquarius; and We have adorned it, with [these] planets, for beholders; and We have guarded them, with meteors, from every outcast devil; except the one who listens by Stealth — he is pursued by a clear flame, a shining meteor that

and send down out of the heaven, [out of] the clouds, water, rain, so that We give it to you to drink, for 
you are not the Storers thereof, that is, the stores thereof are not in your control. Indeed it is We Who give life and bring death, and We are the heirs. Who shall endure, inherit¬ 
ing all creation. And verily We know the predecessors among you, that is, those creatures from Adam who have 
already passed, and verily We know the successors, those who will come afterwards, until the Day of 
Resurrection. And it is indeed your Lord Who will gather them, lo! He is Wise, in His acftions, Knower, of His 
creatures.","We have placed constellations in the heaven and adorned it for the onlookers, . and We have guarded it from every accursed devil, . except the one who manages to eavesdrop, he will then be pursued by a visible burning flame. . As for the earth, We have spread it out and placed therein firm mountains, and caused to grow therein everything in due proportion. . And We have made therein for you means of sustenance and for those[8] whom you do not provide. . There is nothing except that We have its treasuries, and We do not send it down except in a determined measure. .

a dry clay [drawn] from a malleable mud. So, when I have proportioned him, completed him, and breathed, caused to flow, of My Spirit in 
him, so that he becomes a living thing — the annexation of ‘the Spirit’ to him is a conferring of honour 
upon Adam — fall down in prostration before him!’, a prostration [meant as an acft] of salutation by 
bowing. And so the angels prostrated, all of them together (kulluhum ajma’un contains two elements of 
emphasis), except Iblis, the father of the jinn — he was [Standing] among the angels: he refused to be among 
those prostrating. He, [God] exalted be He: ‘O Iblis what is wrong with you, what prevents you, 7 that you are not 
among those prostrating?’ Said he, ‘I was not about to prostrate myself, I should not proStrate myself, before a mortal

ens — for you are indeed accursed, outcast. And indeed the curse shall reSt upon you until the Day of Judgement’, [the Day] of Requital. Said he, ‘My Lord! Reprieve me until the day when they, mankind, shall be resurrected’. Said He, ‘Then lo! you are of those reprieved, until the day of the known time’, the time of [the blowing of] the FirSt Trumpet.

them, among them Gabriel; [how] when they entered unto him, and said, ‘Peace!’, that is, [they said] this very word ( saldm ). 
He, Abraham, said, after having offered them food which they did not eat: ‘Lo! we are afraid of you’. They said, ‘Do not be afraid; lo!, we, are the messengers of your Lord [sent to], give you good 
tidings of a knowledgeable boy’, one very knowledgeable [boy], namely, Isaac — as we mentioned in 
surat Hud [Q. 11:69]. He said, ‘Do you give me good tidings, of a boy, when old age has befallen me?’ [‘ala an mas- 
saniya l-kibaru is a circumstantial qualifier), in other words, deSpite the facft of its having befallen me? So, 
of what, thing, do you give me good tidings?’ (an interrogative meant to indicate amazement). They said, ‘We give you good tidings in truth, sincerely; so do not be of the despairing’, the 
despondent. He said, ‘And who — in other words, no one — despairs (read yaqnitu or yaqnatu) of the mercy 
of his Lord, save those who are aStray?’, [save] disbelievers. 

[ 15 : 57 ] He said, ‘So what is your business, O you who have been sent [by God]?’  They said, ‘We have been sent to a sinning folk, a disbelieving [folk], namely, the people of Lot, 
in order to destroy them;

[of] those who will Stay behind in the chastisement, because of her unbelief.  ","And inform them about the guests of Abraham. .

He said, “Who would despair of his Lord’s mercy except those who are misguided[26]?” . He said, “So, what is your mission, O messengers?” .

take place in the morning. And then came the people of the city, the city of Sodom, that is, the people of Lot, upon being 
told that there were handsome clean-shaven individuals — namely, the angels — in the house of Lot, 
rejoicing (yaSlabshirun is a circumstantial qualifier), desiring to commit an abomination with them. He, Lot, said, ‘Lo! these are my guests, so do not disgrace me; and fear God, and do not humiliate me’, by seeking them to commit an abomination with them. They said, ‘Have we not forbidden you from [entertaining] anyone?’, from offering them 
hospitality? He said, ‘These here are my daughters, if you muSt be doing’, what you desire [to do] in the way 
of satisfying your luSt, then marry them. God, exalted be He, says: By your life — this is an address to the Prophet (s) — in their drunkenness they were bewildered, hesitant. Then the Cry, the Cry of Gabriel, seized them at sunrise. And We made their, that is, their cities’, topmoSt part their nethermost, by Gabriel’s raising them 
[the cities] to the heaven and dropping them face down onto the earth, and We rained on them Stones 
of baked clay, clay baked in fire. Indeed in that, which is mentioned, there are signs, indications of God’s Oneness, for those who 
take note, [those who] observe and take heed. And indeed they, that is, the cities of the people of Lot, are on a road that [Still] remains, 
Quraysh’s route to Syria, [one] not yet effaced: so why do they not take heed from their example? There is indeed a sign, a lesson, in that for believers.","When the messengers came to the household of Lot[29], . he said, “You are unfamiliar people.” . They said, “We have come to you with that [punishment][30] which they have doubted. . We have come to you with the truth, and we are certainly truthful. .

both of them, that is, the cities of the people of Lot and those of [the dwellers in] the wood, are upon a 
open road, plain [to see]: so will you not take heed from their example, O people of Mecca?","And the people of the Forest[38] were wrongdoers. .

15,90,99,"Even as We sent down, chastisement, on those who make division, the Jews and the Christians, those who have reduced the Recitation , 8 namely, those scriptures revealed to them, to parts, be¬ 
lieving in some and disbelieving in others. It is [alternatively] said that the individuals meant here were 
those who ‘divided up’ among themselves the roads to Mecca, barring people from Islam. Some of them 
said that the Qur’an was sorcery, some that it was soothsaying, and others that it was poetry. By your Lord, We shall question them all — a questioning involving rebuke — about what they used to do. So proclaim, O Muhammad (s), what you have been commanded, to [proclaim], in other words, 
declare it openly and carry it out, and turn away from the idolaters — this was [revealed] before the 
command to Struggle [againSt the idolaters]. Indeed We have sufficed you againft the mockers, [who mocked] you, by Our having destroyed 
each one of them through some harm, and these were: al-Walldb. al-Mughira, al-‘Asi b. Wa’il, ‘Udayyb. 
Qays, al-Aswad b. al-Muttalib and al-Aswad b. ‘Abd Yaghuth, those [mockers] who set up besides God another god: (this [entire clause] is an adjedival quali¬ 
fication; but it is also said to be the subject, and because there is an implicit conditional meaning [in the 
above-mentioned clause], 9 the [particle] fa has been inserted into the predicate, which is [the follow¬ 
ing] ) soon they will know, the sequel of their affair. And verily ( wa-laqad is for confirmation) We know that your breaft is [at times] oppressed by 
what they say, in the way of mockery and denial. So glorify, intimately [repeating], the praise of your Lord, in other words, say subhana’Llahi wa- 
bi-hamdihi — and be of those who prostrate themselves, those who pray; and worship your Lord until Certainty — Death — comes to you. 


8 The author clearly understands Quran here as that scripture revealed to Jews and Christians and which muSt have been ‘recited’, 
much like the Qur’an is by Muslims. 

9 In other words, it is as if the clause read thus: ‘those who, if they set up another god besides God, then soon they will know’.

[ 16] al-Nahl 


Meccan, except for the laSt three verses, which are Medinese; it consists of 128 verses, revealed after 
[surat] al-Kahf. 


In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","just as We sent down [punishment] upon those who divided [their religion][48], . those who split the Qur’an into different portions[49]. . By your Lord, We will surely question them all . concerning what they used to do. . Then proclaim what you are commanded, and turn away from those who associate partners with Allah. . We will surely suffice you against the mockers[50], . those who set up beside Allah another god; they will come to know. . We know that you are distressed by what they say. . So glorify your Lord with praise and be among those who prostrate [to Him][51], . and worship your Lord until the certainty [of death] comes to you.","[48] i.e., the People of the Book, who accepted some portions of the Torah and rejected some. . [49] i.e., calling it magic, divination, or poetry. . [50] For this command will be tough, Allah gave him assurance. . [51] The remedy is in resorting to Allah Almighty."
16,1,9,"When the idolaters found chastisement slow in coming, the following was revealed: God’s com¬ 
mandment has come, that is, the Hour [has come] ([this verb] ata is in the past tense because it means 
that [the event therein described] will come to pass) in other words, it [Gods commandment] is close at 
hand, so do not seek to hasten it, do not demand it before its [due] time, for it will come to pass without 
doubt. Glory be to Him — an affirmation of His transcendence — and exalted be He above what they 
associate, with Him, in the way of others. He sends down the angels, namely, Gabriel, with the Spirit, with the Revelation, of His command, 
by His will, to whomever He will of His servants, and these are the prophets, [saying] that (an is explica¬ 
tive): Warn, threaten the disbelievers with chastisement and make them aware, that there is no God save 
Me: so fear Me, fear Me. He created the heavens and the earth with the Truth, that is, with the purpose of [manifesting] 
truth. Exalted be He above what they associate, with Him in the way of idols. He created man from a drop of fluid, of Sperm, until He makes him Strong and tough, yet behold! 
he is disputatious, extremely quarrelsome, openly, making this [disputatiousness] clear in his rejection 
of resurrection, contending: Who shall revive the bones when they are decayed? [Q. 36:78]. And the cattle, camels, cows and sheep (al-an‘ama, cattle’, is in the accusative because of the im¬ 
plied verb [governing it], as explained by [the following words, khalaqaha lakum]). He created them for 
you, [you being] included among the number of mankind. 1 In them there is warmth, that by which you 
keep warm in the way of clothes and garments, [taken] from their hairs and wools, as well as [other] 
uses, such as [their] offspring, milk and for you to ride, and of them you eat (the adverbial clause [wa- 
minha, ‘of them’] precedes [the verb] for the purpose of [establishing harmony with] the end-rhyme [of 
the Qur’anic verse]); and for you there is in them beauty, adornment, when you bring them [home] to reSl, [when you] 
return them to their resting places in the evening, and when you drive them forth to pasture, when you 
bring them out to the grazing pastures in the morning. And they bear your burdens, your baggage, to a land which you cotdd not reach, without being 
on camel-back, save with great trouble to yourselves, [save by] Straining them. Indeed your Lord is 
Gentle, Merciful, to you, in having created these for you. And, He created, horses and mules and asses, that you may ride them, and for adornment (wa- 
zinatan is an objeCt denoting reason; the use of both of these reasons [‘to ride’ and ‘for adornment’] as il¬ 
lustrations of [God’s] graces does not preclude that they may have been created for other purposes, such 
as for consumption in the case of horses — which is established [as lawful] by a hadith in both Sahihs [of 
Bukhari and Muslim]); and He creates what you do not know, of marvelous and Strange things. And God’s is the direction of the way, that is, to point out the Straight path, and some of them, that 
is, the paths, are deviant, swerving away from Straightness. And had He willed, to guide you, He woidd 
have guided you, to seek the way, all, so that you would be [rightly] guided of your own choice.","Allah’s decree is coming[1], so do not seek to hasten it. Glorified and Exalted is He far above what they associate with Him[2]! . He sends down the angels with revelation by His command to whom He wills of His slaves, [saying], “Warn that none has the right to be worshiped except Me, so fear Me.” . He created the heavens and earth for a true purpose. Exalted is He far above what they associate with Him! . He created man from a sperm-drop, and then he becomes a clear adversary[3]. . And He has created the livestock for you as a source of warmth and other benefits[4], and from them you eat. . There is beauty for you in them when you bring them home to rest and when you take them out to graze[5]. . And they carry your heavy loads to lands that you could not reach without great hardship. Indeed, your Lord is Most Gracious, Most Merciful. . And [He created] the horses, mules and donkeys for you to ride and for adornment, and He creates other things that you do not know. . It is upon Allah to show the straight path, while other ways are deviant. If He had willed, He could have guided you all.","[1] Allah’s punishment is imminent and certain, as the Hour is approaching.
 [2] Shirk (associating partners with Allah) is the most egregious of all sins, as He warned against it right after mentioning the imminence of the Hour. Allah stresses against Shirk or calls for pure Tawhīd (monotheism) in the two subsequent verses as well. . [3] As soon as he becomes strong and independent. The ones who are meant here are, especially, the disbelievers who deny resurrection, argue against the Truth, and are ungrateful to Allah’s favors. . [4] i.e., in clothing, tents, furnishings, etc. . [5] Their bringing back is mentioned before their setting off to pasture because that is when their udders and waists are full and thus more pleasing to the beholder."
16,10,13,"He it is Who sends down water from the heaven, whence you have drink, for you to drink, and 
whence are trees, which grow because of this [water], whereat you let your animals graze. 

1 In other words, God created these for all mankind, but the address happens to be for you. 


Sura al-Nahl With it He makes the crops grow for you, and olives and date-palms and vines and all kinds 
of fruit. Surely in that, which is mentioned, there is a sign, indicating His Oneness, exalted He be, for 
people who refled, upon His handiwork and therefore believe. And He disposed for you the night and the day and the sun (wa’l-shamsa, read in the accusa¬ 
tive as a supplement to what precedes it; or read wa’l-shamsu in the nominative as a subjedt [of a new 
sentence]) 2 and the moon and the ftars (also read both ways) 3 are disposed ( musakhkharatin, read in 
the accusative as a circumstantial qualifier, or in the nominative [ musakhkhardtun ] as a predicate) by 
His command, by His will. Surely in that there are signs for people who understand, [a people] who 
reflecft. And, He has disposed for you, whatever He has created for you in the earth, of animals, plants 
and otherwise, diverse in hue, such as red, yellow, green and otherwise. Surely in that there is a sign for 
people who remember, [a people who] are admonished.","It is He Who sends down rain from the sky, from it you drink, and by it plants thrive on which you pasture your livestock. . He causes to grow therewith crops, olives, palm trees, grapevines and all kinds of fruits[6] for you. Indeed, there is a sign in this for people who reflect. . And He has subjected for you the night and day, the sun and moon, and the stars[7] are made subservient by His command. Indeed, there are signs in this for people of understanding. . And He has created for you various kinds of things on earth[8]. Indeed, there are signs in this for people who take heed.","[6] It highlight the great wonder that although all these are irrigated with the same water, yet they come in different kinds, tastes, colors and shapes. . [7] Stars are crucial for knowing the directions in the darkness of the sea and the land. . [8] Such as animals, minerals, plants and inanimate objects."
16,14,14,"And He it is Who disposed the sea, [He it is Who] subdued it, that it might be sailed upon and 
dived in, that you may eat from it fresh meat, that is, fish, and bring forth from it ornaments which you 
wear, namely, pearls and coral. And you see, observe, the ships ploughing therein, ploughing through 
the water, that is, cleaving it as they sail upon it, coming and going with the same wind; and that you 
may seek (wa-li-tabtaghu is a supplement to li-ta’kulu, ‘that you may eat’) of His bounty, exalted He be, 
by way of commerce, and that you might be thankful, to God for [all] that.","It is He Who has subjected the sea, so that you may eat from it tender meat and extract ornaments to wear. And you see the ships cleaving their way through its waves[9], so that you may seek His bounty and so that you may give thanks.","[9] Another great sign of Allah, that heavy ships and vessels run smoothly on the surface of water without sinking."
16,15,18,"And He caSt into the earth firm mountains, leSl it should shake, move, with you, and, He made 
therein, rivers, such as the Nile, and ways, roads, so that you might be guided, to your destinations, — and landmarks [as well], by which you might find the roads, [landmarks] such as mountains, 
during the day, and by the Star, meaning, by the Stars, they are guided, to the roads and to the direction 
of prayer ( qibla ) by night. Is He then Who creates — namely, God — as he who does not create, namely, idols, so that you 
associate them with Him in worship? No. Will you not then remember, this, and so become believers? And if you were to count God’s grace you could never reckon it, number it precisely, let alone be 
able to give thanks for it. Indeed God is Forgiving, Merciful, since He beStows graces upon you despite 
your shortcomings and your [acfts of] disobedience.","And He has placed into the earth firm mountains, so it does not tremor with you, and there are rivers[10] and pathways so that you may find your way, . and landmarks and the stars by which they find their way[11]. . Is then He Who creates equal to one who cannot create? Will you not then take heed? . If you try to count Allah’s favors, you will not be able to enumerate them. Indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","[10] Rivers are like bloodlines spreading life in the land; people drink from them along with their livestock, grow crops, and travel through them. . [11] With landmarks to find the way during the daytime and with the stars at night."
16,19,23,"And God knows what you keep secret and what you disclose. And those whom you invoke ( tad'una, or read yad'una ‘they invoke’) besides God, namely, the 
idols, do not create anything, but are themselves created, fashioned from Stones and other [materials]. 77 i ey are dead, possessing no life ( amwatun, ‘dead’, is a second predicate), 4 not living (an em¬ 
phasis), and they, the idols, are not aware when, is the time [in which], they shall be raised, that is, 
creatures: so how can they be worshipped? For, only the Creator, the Living, the Knower of the Unseen 
can be a God. Your God, the One deserving of your worship, is One God, without [any] equal in [terms of] 
His essence or His attributes, and this is God, exalted He be. But as for those who do not believe in the 
Hereafter their hearts are in denial, rejecting the Oneness [of God], and they are arrogant, scorning to 
believe in it. Without doubt, verily, God knows what they keep secret and what they disclose, and will requite 
them for it. Indeed He does not love the arrogant, meaning, He will punish them. 

2 The English translation assumes the former (accusative) reading. 

3 In other words, either in the accusative or in the nominative, the variants are given by Ibn Mujahid ( Qiraat , 370). 

4 After the predicate of the previous statement, which is la yakhluquna shay’an, ‘they do not create anything’.

Tafsir al-Jalalayn","Allah knows all that you conceal and all that you reveal. . But those whom they invoke besides Allah do not create anything; rather, they themselves are created. . They are dead, not living[12]; not even knowing when they will be resurrected. . Your God is One God. But those who do not believe in the Hereafter, their hearts refuse to know, and they are arrogant[13]. . Undoubtedly, Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal[14]. Indeed, He does not like those who are arrogant.","[12] i.e., inanimate or without understanding. . [13] Arrogance and snobbery are the underlying reasons for denying Allah’s Signs and rejecting the Truth. . [14] He will hold them to account over them."
16,24,29,"The following was revealed regarding al-Nadr b. al-Harith: And when it is said to them, ‘What is 
it (ma is an interrogative particle; dha is a relative particle) that your Lord has revealed?’, to Muhammad 
(s), they say, [that] these [revelations] are, ‘fables, lies, of the ancients’, in order to lead people astray. That they may bear, at the conclusion of the matter, their burdens, their sins, complete, none of 
them expunged, on the Day of Resurrection and also, [bear] some, of the burdens of those whom they 
lead aftray without any knowledge, because they summoned them to error and they [the latter] fol¬ 
lowed them, and thus both share in the sin. How evil, awful, is the burden they bear, this load [of sins] 
of theirs which they carry. Those before them had indeed plotted, [those] such as Nimrod — he built a lofty tower that he 
might ascend through it to the heavens and wage war against its inhabitants; then God came at. He aimed 
at, their edifice from the foundations, from the base, unleashing against it winds and earthquake, which 
demolished it; and so the roof collapsed upon them from above them, that is, while they were beneath it, 
and the chastisement came upon them whence they were not aware, from a direction which would not 
have occurred to them: [alternatively] it is said that this [description] is a simile for [demonstrating] the 
thwarting of that which they had settled on in the way of plots againSt [God’s] messengers. Then on the Day of Resurrection He will disgrace them, humiliate them, and He, God, will 
say, to them by the tongues of the angels, in rebuke: ‘Where are those associates of Mine, as you [were 
wont to] claim, concerning whom, for whose sake, you used to make breaches?’, you used to opposed 
the believers. Those who were given knowledge, from among the prophets and believers, will say, ‘Truly 
disgrace on this day, as well as misfortune, are for the disbelievers — they say this rejoicing at their [the 
disbelievers’] misfortune — those whom the angels take [in death] (read [feminine person] tatawaffahum or [masculine] 
yatawaffahum ) while they are wronging themselves’, through disbelief. Then they will offer submission, 
becoming compliant and submitting themselves [to belief in God] upon death, saying: ‘We were not do¬ 
ing any evil’, [any] associating others with God, whereat the angels say: ‘Nay! Surely God is Knower of 
what you used to do’, and will requite you for it. And it will also be said to them: So enter the gates of Hell, to abide therein! Evil indeed is the 
lodging, the abode, of the arrogant.","When it is said to them, “What has your Lord sent down?” They say, “Ancient fables!” . They will bear their burdens in full on the Day of Resurrection and some burdens of those whom they misled without knowledge[15]. How terrible is what they will bear! . Those who came before them plotted, so Allah uprooted their buildings from their foundations and the roof fell down on top of them[16], and the punishment came on them from where they could not imagine. . Then on the Day of Resurrection, He will disgrace them and will say, “Where are My [so-called] partners for whose sake you used to oppose [the truth]?” Those who were given knowledge will say, “Today disgrace and misery will befall the disbelievers.” . Those whose souls are seized by the angels while they wrong themselves will then offer submission, “We did not do anything evil.” “Yes, indeed you did! Allah knows well what you used to do. . So enter the gates of Hell, abiding therein forever. What a terrible abode for those who were arrogant!”","[15] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Whoever calls to misguidance will incur as much sin as that of whoever follows him.” [Muslim: 2674]. . [16] i.e., Allah caused their plot to fail and exposed their plan."
16,30,32,"And it is said to those who fear, idolatry, ‘What has your Lord revealed?’ Theywillsay, ‘Good! 
For those who were virtuous, by [embracing] faith, in this world, there will be a virtuous [reward], 
namely, a goodly life; and truly the abode of the Hereafter, that is, Paradise, is better, than the world and 
all that is in it. God says [the following] regarding it: And truly excellent is the abode of the God-fearing, 
it [the Hereafter] is. Gardens of Eden, as a [place of] residence ( jannatu Adnin is a subject, the predicate of which is 
[what follows]) which they will enter, [ Gardens] underneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall have 
whatever they wish. So, [with such] a reward, God rewards the God-fearing, those whom ( alladhina is a description) the angels take away [in death] while they are goodly, 
pure of any unbelief, saying, to them upon death: ‘Peace be on you!, and it is said to them in the Hereaf¬ 
ter: Enter Paradise because of what you used to do’.","And it will be said to those who fear Allah, “What has your Lord sent down?” They will say, “All that is good.” For those who do good in this world, there is a good reward[17]; and the home of the Hereafter is far better. What an excellent home for those who fear Allah! . They will enter the Gardens of Eternity, under which rivers flow. They will have therein whatever they wish[18]. This is how Allah rewards those who fear Him, . those whose souls the angels take while they are in a state of purity[19], saying, “Peace be upon you; enter Paradise for what you used to do.”","[17] Of a plentiful and satisfying life in this world. . [18] Unlike this worldly life. . [19] Their souls will be purified from polytheism, sins, and ill feelings."
16,33,34,"Do they, the disbelievers, await anything but that the angels should come to them (read [femi¬ 
nine person] ta’tihim or [masculine] ya’tihim) to seize their spirits, or that there should come your 
Lord’s command?, chastisement, or the resurrection that entails it. So, just as these have done, did those 
before them, from among the [former] communities: they denied their messengers and were therefore 
destroyed. And God did not wrong them, destroying them for no sin, but they used to wrong themselves, 
through disbelief. So that the evils of what they did smote them, that is, the requital of these [evil things smote

them], and there besieged, it was sent down [against], them that which they used to mock, namely, the 
chastisement.","Are [the disbelievers] waiting for the angels to come to them[20] or for the command of your Lord to come[21]? Those who came before them did the same. It was not Allah Who wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves. . They were afflicted by the evil consequences of their deeds, and they were overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule.","[20] To take their souls while they are unjust to themselves.
 [21] To punish them in this worldly life."
16,35,40,"And the idolaters, from among the Meccans, say, ‘Had God willed we woidd not have wor¬ 
shipped anything besides Him — neither we, nor our fathers — nor woidd we have deemed anything 
sacred besides Him’, in the way of those [camels] called bahiras and saiba . 5 In other words, our idolatry 
and our deeming [these animals] sacred are [effecfted] by His will; therefore He mu St be satisfied with 
this. God, exalted He be, says: So did those before them, that is, they denied their messengers regarding 
that which they [the messengers] brought them. Yet are messengers charged with anything save plain 
conveyance [of the Message]? It is not their duty to guide. And verily We sent forth among every community a messenger, juSt as We have sent you forth 
among these [Meccans], [to say]: ‘Worship God, profess [belief in] His Oneness, and shun false deities’, 
graven images, and do not worship them. Then among them were some whom God guided, and they 
believed, and among them were some who deserved to be in error, according to God’s knowledge, and 
so they did not believe. So travel, O disbelievers of Mecca, in the land and observe the nature of the 
consequence of those who denied, their messengers, in that they were destroyed. If you, O Muhammad (s), are eager for them to be guided, when God has already made them go 
astray, you will not be able to achieve this: For God does not guide (read passive la yuhda [?], or aCtive la 
yahdi) he whom He has [ already] sent a fir ay, he whom He desires to send astray, and they will have no 
helpers, [no] protestors from God’s chastisement. And they swear by God their mofi earnefi oaths, in other words, with their 111 mo St earnestness 
therein, that God will not resurrefi the dead. God, exalted be He, says: Nay, He will resurrect them: it is 
a promise binding upon Him (both wa’dan and haqqan are verbal nouns, used for emphasis, and are in 
the accusative because of the verbal actions implicit in them; in other words, He promised that and made 
it a binding truth) but mo fi people, that is, the people of Mecca, do not know, that. That He may make clear to them ( li-yubayyina is semantically con needed to an implied 
yab’athuhum, ‘He will resurrect them’) what they differ, with believers, in, of matters of religion, by 
punishing them and rewarding the believers, and that the disbelievers may know that they were liars, 
when they denied the Resurrection. All that We say to a thing, when We will it, that is, when We will that it come into existence 
(qawluna is a subjeeft, the predicate of which is [what follows]) is to say to it ‘Be,’ and it is, in other words, 
and that [thing] is (a variant reading [for fa-yakiinu] has fa-yakuna as a supplement to naqula). The verse 
is intended as an affirmation of the power [of God] to resurrect.","Those who associate partners with Allah say, “If Allah had willed, neither we nor our forefathers would have worshiped anything besides Him, nor would we have prohibited anything without His command[22].” Those who came before them did the same. Is the duty of the messengers except to convey the message clearly? . Indeed, We sent to every community a messenger, [saying], “Worship Allah and shun false gods[23].” Among them were some whom Allah guided, while others were destined to stray. So travel through the land and see how was the end of the deniers! . Even though you are keen to guide them, Allah does not guide those whom He causes to stray[24], and they will have no helpers. . They swear by Allah their solemn oaths that Allah will not resurrect those who die. Yes, He will! It is a true promise upon Him, but most people do not know – . so that He may make clear to them that over which they differ, and so that the disbelievers may realize that they were liars. . When We intend something, We only say to it, “Be!”, and it is.","[22] They falsely argue citing predestination (al-qadā’ wa al-qadar), while they were given the ability to choose the path to follow in this life. . [23] Tāghūt: false objects of worship. See footnote 2:256. . [24] As a result of their choice to reject guidance."
16,41,42,"And those who emigrated for God’s cause, to establish His religion, after they had been wronged, 
through harm, [those] from among the people of Mecca — these were the Prophet (s) and his Compan¬ 
ions — truly We shall lodge them in this world in a goodly lodging, namely, Medina, and the reward 
of the Hereafter, that is, Paradise, is surely greater, grander, did they but know, that is, the disbelievers 
— or those who Stayed behind and did not emigrate — [did they but know] the honour that belongs to 
emigrants, they would have followed them. They are, those who endure, the harm inflicted by the idolaters and [endure] the emigration 
in order to make manifest the religion, and put their trufi in their Lord, so that He provides for them 
whence they do not reckon.","Those who migrated for the sake of Allah after being oppressed[25], We will surely give them good in this world. But the reward of the Hereafter is greater, if only they knew, . those who endured patiently and put their trust in their Lord.","[25] The Companions who fled persecution to Abyssinia, or the early migrants to Madinah."
16,43,50,"And We did not send before you anything other than men, to whom We revealed, and [sent] not 
angels: ‘So ask the followers of the Remembrance, those knowledgeable in the Torah and the GoSjtels; if 
you do not know’, that, then they know it, and you are more likely to believe them than the believers are 
to believe Muhammad (s),

Tafsir al-Jaldlayn [We sent them] with clear signs (bi’l-bayyindt is semantically connected to an omitted [verb]),

brance, the Qur’an, that you may make clear to mankind what has been revealed to them, therein, in 
the way of [what is] lawful and unlawful, and that perhaps they might refled, upon this and take heed. Do they feel secure, those who have schemed evil, schemes against the Prophet (s) at the Council 
Assembly, [schemes] such as detaining him, killing him or banishing him, as mentioned in [surat] al-Anfal 
[Q. 8:30], that God will not cause the earth to swallow them, as [God did] with Qarun [Q. 28:81], or that 
the chastisement will not come upon them whence they are not aware of?, that is, in a way which would not 
occur to them. Indeed, they were destroyed at Badr even though they had never anticipated it. Or that He will not seize them in their going to and fro, during their travels for commerce, 
whereupon they will not be able to escape?, [whereupon] they will not be able to elude the chastise¬ 
ment. Or that He will not seize them amid [growing] fear?, [amid] a gradual diminishing [of their 
numbers] little by little, until all are destroyed (‘ala takhawwufin is a circumstantial qualifier referring 
to the subject of the verb [God] or the object). Indeed then your Lord is Gentle, Merciful, insofar as He 
does not haSten for them their punishment. Or have they not observed the things which God has created, which caSt a shadow, such as trees 
or a mountain, how their shadows incline to the right and to the left (shamail is the plural of shimdl), in

is a circumstantial qualifier), that is to say, subservient to Him with rested: to what is required of them, 
and [how] they, the shadows, are subjed?, humbled: they [the shadows] are likened to rational beings

servient in terms of what is required of it — moSt of what is given [by way of example] is non-rational, 
since these are [the more] numerous — and the angels [also prostrate] — these are singled out for men¬ 
tion because of their merit — and they are not arrogant, they do [not] disdain to worship Him. They, that is, the angels, fear (yakhafuna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person gov¬ 
erning [the verb] yaStakbiruna, ‘they are [not] arrogant’) their Lord from above them (min fawqihim is 
a circumstantial qualifier referring to [the suffixed pronoun] -hum [offawqihim]) in other words, [they 
fear their Lord], being High above them with the power to subjugate, and they do what they are com¬ 
manded, to [do].","We did not send before you except men to whom We sent revelation. Ask the people of knowledge[26], if you do not know. . [We sent them] with clear proofs and scriptures, and We have sent down to you [O Prophet] the Reminder to explain to people what has been sent down to them, and so that they may reflect. . Do those who devise evil plots feel secure that Allah will not make them sink into the earth or that the punishment will not come upon them from where they do not expect? . Or that He may seize them while they are going about[27], and they will have no escape? . Or that He will seize them when they are in a state of fear? But your Lord is indeed Ever Gracious, Most Merciful[28]. . Do they not see the things that Allah has created, how their shadows incline to the right and left, prostrating[29] to Allah in all humility? . To Allah prostrates[30] all that is in the heavens and on earth of living things, and so do the angels; and they do not show arrogance. . They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded.","[26] People of the knowledge (ahl al-dhikr) are the People of the Book, the Jews and Christians.

16,51,55,"And God has said: ‘Do not choose two gods (ithnayn is for emphasis). Truly there is only One 
God — He has added this [Statement] to affirm [His] Divinity and Oneness — so be in awe of Me 
[alone]’-, fear Me, to the exclusion of anyone else — herein is a shift from the third person [to the firSt], And to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth, as possessions, creatures and 
servants. And to Him belongs the religion, the obedience, that endures, the [one] everlasting (wdsiban, 
is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-din, ‘the religion, and is operated by the sense of the adverbial 
clause). Will you then fear any other than God?, when He is the True God, other than Whom there is no 
god (the interrogative is a [Statement of] rejection and rebuke). Whatever grace you have, it is from God, none but He brings it (md, ‘whatever’, is either a con¬ 
ditional or relative [particle]). Then when misfortune, poverty or illness, befalls you, to Him you cry for 
help, [to Him] you raise your voices with pleas for help and supplications, and you do not call upon any 
other than Him. Then when He has rid you of the misfortune, behold, a group of you attribute partners 
to their Lord, 


240 


Sura al-Nahl in order to deny that, grace, which We have given them. So enjoy, that consent ofyours to wor¬ 
ship idols (an imperative meant as a threat ):for soon you shall know, the consequence of this.","Allah said, “Do not take two gods[31]. He is only One God, so fear Me alone.” . To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and earth, and constant devotion is to Him alone. Will you then fear anyone other than Allah? . Whatever blessing you have, it is from Allah. Then when you are afflicted with hardship, to Him alone you cry out for help[32]. . Then as soon as He removes the hardship from you, some of you associate partners with their Lord, . showing their ingratitude for what We have given them. Then enjoy yourselves now, but you will soon come to know.","[31] i.e., more than one. . [32] The One Who grants favors and removes hardship is to be worshiped alone."
16,56,62,"And they, that is, the idolaters, assign, to what they do not know, that they cause harm and can¬ 
not benefit [them] — namely, the idols — a portion of that which We have provided them with, of crops 
and cattle, saying that ‘this is for God and this is for our partners’. By God, you will indeed be questioned 
(a questioning of rebuke; there is a shift herein from the third [to the second] person) about what you 
used to fabricate, against God, such as [claiming] that He commanded you to [do] this. And they assign to God daughters, by claiming that the angels are the daughters of God — Be 
He glorified! — a declaration that He is [exalted] above that which they claim — while they will have 
what they desire, namely, sons (the Status of this sentence is either independent [nominative], or that 
of an [accusative] objecft of [the verb] yafaluna, ‘they assign’). The meaning is that to Him they assign 
daughters, to whom they are averse, when [in any case] He is [exalted] beyond having offspring, while 
to themselves they assign sons, of their own choosing, so that the beSt is theirs exclusively — like where 
God says, Now, ask them: are daughters to be for your Lord, while sons are to be for them? [Q. 37:149]. And when one of them is given the tidings of a girl, that will be born to him, his face becomes 
darkened, transformed like that of one [suddenly] struck by grief, and he chokes inwardly, filled with 
anguish: so how is it that daughters are attributed to Him, exalted be He? He hides, disappearing , from people, that is, [from] his people, out of distress at the tidings given 
to him, fearing mockery, unsure what to do with it [the newborn]: shall he retain it — refrain from kill¬ 
ing it — in humiliation, [enduring] shame and disgrace, or trample into the duSt, by burying it alive. 
Verily wretched is what they judge, [evil is] this judgement of theirs, in which they ascribe to their Crea¬ 
tor [that His are the] daughters, who have such a [lowly] status in their eyes. For those who do not believe in the Hereafter, namely, [for] the disbelievers, there is an evil 
description, in other words, [theirs is] the most evil attribute, meaning, the most vile, which is their 
burying alive of [newborn] girls, decile the fad that they are needed for the purposes of marriage; and 
the loftiest description belongs to God, [His is] the attribute mod sublime, namely, that there is no god 
except Him. And He is the Mighty, in His kingdom, the Wise, in His creation. And if God were to take mankind to task for their wrongdoing, [wrongdoing] through ads of 
disobedience. He woidd not leave upon it, that is, [upon] the earth, any living being, any single [living] 
thing moving upon it; but He gives them respite until an appointed term; and when their term comes 
they will not defer, from it, by a single hour nor advance, it. Still, they assign to God what they dislike, for themselves — such as daughters, partners in 
power, and the mistreatment of messengers. 6 And their tongues, despite this, relate, tell, the lie, which 
is, that theirs will be the beSt reward, with God, namely, Paradise, as He [God] dates [in their words 
elsewhere]: And in case I am returned to my Lord, I will indeed have the beSt reward with Him [Q. 41:50]. 
But God, exalted be He, says: Without any doubt — verily — theirs shall be the Fire and they shall be 
abandoned therein, or [it, mufratun, means that] they shall be foremod in [entering] it (a variant read¬ 
ing [for mufratun] has mufritun, meaning that ‘they transgress the bounds’). 7","They assign a portion of what We have provided for them to those [idols] who know nothing. By Allah, you will surely be called to account for what you used to fabricate. . To Allah they ascribe daughters[33] – glory be to Him – but for themselves they choose what they desire [i.e., sons]. . When one of them is given the good news of a female baby, his face darkens while suppressing his anguish. . He hides away from people because of the bad news he was given. Should he keep her in disgrace, or bury her in the dust? How terrible is their judgment! . Those who do not believe in the Hereafter have evil attributes[34], and Allah has the highest attributes[35], for He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. . If Allah were to take people to task for their wrongdoing, He would not leave a single living being on earth, but He gives them respite for an appointed time. When their time comes, they cannot delay it for a moment nor can they bring it forward. . They attribute to Allah[36] what they dislike for themselves, and their tongues make false claim that they will have the best [reward][37]. Without a doubt for them there will be the Fire, and they will be neglected.","[33] The pagans falsely claimed that the angels were Allah’s daughters. . [34] As described in the previous two verses such as the need for children, ignorance, and disbelief.
 [35] Attributes of grandeur, perfection, and knowledge, and is free from all imperfections and need. . [36] That the angels are Allah’s daughters. [37] Both in this life and in the Hereafter."
16,63,64,"By God, We verily sent to communities before you, messengers. But Satan adorned for them 
their deeds, [their] evil [deeds], so that they considered them to be good [deeds] and therefore they 
denied the messengers. So he is their patron, the guardian of their affairs, today, that is, [now] in this 
world, and for them there will be a painful chastisement, in the Hereafter. It is also said that by al-yawm, 
‘today’, is meant the Day of Resurrection, narrating the events as though they are taking place [now]. In 

6 In other words, they dislike daughters and so assign them to God; they would hate to share leadership, yet ascribe a partner to 
God and they midreat His messengers, when they themselves would not approve of their own emissaries being treated in such a 
way. 

7 In which case, the sense is no longer a future one, but an assertion of the fad that they deserve the Fire: ‘Theirs shall be the Fire, 
for they transgress the bounds’.

other words, they have no guardian other than him [in other words, Satan], and as he is incapable of 
helping himself, how could he possibly help them? And We have not revealed to you, O Muhammad (s), the Book, the Qur’an, except [for the pur¬ 
pose] that you may make clear to them, to mankind, that wherein they differ, in the matter of religion, 
and as a guidance ( wa-hudan is a supplement to wa-li-tubayyina, and that you may make clear’) and as 
a mercy for a people who believe, in it.","By Allah, We sent [messengers] to nations before you, but Satan made their deeds[38] appealing to them. He is their ally today, and for them there will be a painful punishment. . We have only sent down to you the Book so that you may make clear to them what they differed about[39] and as a guidance and mercy for people who believe.","[38] Such as disbelief, polytheism, rejecting the Messenger, and evil deeds. .

16,65,69,"And God sends down water from the heaven and therewith revives the earth, with plants, after 
its death, [after] its drying up. Surely in that, which is mentioned, there is a sign, indicating the [truth 
of the] Resurrection, for a people who listen, listening and then reflecting. And truly for you there is in the cattle a lesson, an example to learn from. We give you to drink

cant, a wine that intoxicates — it [the wine] is referred to by the verbal noun [sakaran, ‘intoxicant’], and 
this [verse] came before it was prohibited — and goodly provision, such as dates, raisins, vinegar, and

can resort, and among the trees, [also] habitations, and among the trellises which they raise, that is, the 
places which humans build for you — for otherwise it [the bee] would not resort to these [places]. 8 Then eat from every [kind of] fruit, and follow, enter, the ways of your Lord, [follow] His paths

pose no difficulty for you, even if it should be rough [terrain], and [such that] you would not lose your

[that it means that it is a cure only] for some [ailments], as indicated by the indefinite [noun] shifaun, 
‘a cure’; or [that it is a cure] for all [ailments] when supplemented with some other [remedy]; or without 
these [other remedies] but with the resolve ( niyya ) [to get better]. The Prophet (s) used to prescribe it for 
anyone suffering from stomach pains, as reported by the two Shaykhs [Bukhari and Muslim]. Surely in 
that there is a sign for a people who reflect, upon God’s handiwork, exalted be He.","Allah sends down rain from the sky and revives thereby the earth after its death. Indeed, there is a sign in this for people who listen[40]. . And there is surely a lesson for you in livestock.

And from the fruits of palm trees and grapevines, you make intoxicants[42] and good provision[43]. Indeed, there is a sign in this for people of understanding. . Your Lord inspired the bees, “Make homes in the mountains, the trees, and in the trellises that people put up, . Then feed on every kind of fruit and follow the ways that your Lord made easy for you.” There comes out from their bellies a drink[44] of various colors, in which there is healing for people.

16,70,72,"And God has created you, when you were nothing, then He takes you [in death], when your 
terms [of life] are concluded; and there are some among you who are relegated to the moil abjeCl Stage

to be shared [equally] between them and their slaves, so that they, that is, the slaves and [their] masters, 
become equal, partners, in reaped thereof. The meaning is: they do not have partners from among their 
slaves in reSped: of their wealth, so how can they make certain of God’s servants partners of His? Is it 
then the grace of God that they deny?, [that] they reject!, when they ascribe partners to Him? And God made for you mates from your own selves, thus He created Eve from Adam’s rib and 
[created] all mankind from the seminal fluids of men and women, and made for you, from your mates, 
children and grandchildren, and He provided you with the good things, of [all] kinds of fruits, seeds 
and animals. Is it then in falsehood, [in] the idol, that they believe and in the grace of God that they 
disbelieve?, when they associate others [with God]?","Allah has created you, then He causes you to die. Among you are some who are left to reach the most decrepit age[45], so that they may know nothing after having known much. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, Most Capable. . Allah has favored some of you over others in provision. Those who are favored will not share their provision with their slaves, so that they may become equal to them[46]. Do they then deny the favors of Allah? . Allah has made for you spouses of your own kind[47], and has given you through your spouses children and grandchildren, and has given you provision from good things. Do they still believe in falsehood and deny the favors of Allah?","[45] i.e., old age when both the physical and mental powers of a human diminish. .

— and these are the idols. So do not Strike any similitude for God, [do not] ascribe to God likenesses and then associate 
them with Him [in power]. Tridy God knows, that there is nothing like Him, and you do not know, 
this. God Strikes a similitude ( mathalan, this is substituted by [the following, ‘abdan mamlukan ]) a 
slave who is a chattel (mamlukan, an adjedive to distinguish him [this type of slave] from a free man, 
who is the servant of God [alone]) having no power over anything, since he has no maStery, and one on 
whom (man, is an indefinite [noun], adjedivally qualified, in other words, a free man) We have bestowed 
a fair provision from Us, such that he Spends thereof secretly and openly, that is, disposing of it as he 
wishes: the firSt similitude is for the idols, while the second is His, exalted be He. Are they equal?, the 
powerless slaves and the dispensing free men? No. Praise belongs to God, alone. But moSt of them, that 
is, the people of Mecca, do not know, the chastisement they will come to, and so they associate others 
with God. And God Strikes a similitude (mathalan, this is substituted by [the following, rajulayn]) two 
men, one of whom is dumb [from birth], having no power over anything, as he cannot understand nor 
be understood, and who is a liability, burdensome, to his master: — the [legal] guardian of his affairs 

— wherever he directs him, he does not bring, therefrom, any good, he does [not] succeed, and this is 
the similitude of the disbeliever. Is he, that is, the dumb one mentioned, equal to one who enjoins jus¬ 
tice, that is, to one who is able to Speak, of benefit to people, since he enjoins it [justice] and encourages 
[others to] it, and follows a path, a way, that is Straight? — this being the second [man], the believer 

— No [he is not equal to him]. It is also said that this [laSt similitude] is a similitude of God, while the 
[similitude of the] dumb one is of the idols, so that the preceding [verse] contains the similitude of the 
disbeliever and the believer.","They worship besides Allah those who have nothing to provide for them from the heavens and earth[48], nor are they capable of doing so. . So do not make comparisons to Allah[49]. Indeed, Allah knows and you do not know[50]. . Allah makes a comparison of a bonded slave who has no power over anything and a [free] person whom We granted good provision from Us, and he spends from it secretly and openly. Are they equal? All praise be to Allah. But most of them do not know[51]. . And Allah makes a comparison of two men, one of them is dumb and unable to do anything, and he is a burden to his master; wherever he directs him, he brings no good[52]. Is he equal to the one who enjoins justice and follows a straight path?","[48] i.e., rain from the sky or plants from the earth. . [49] As there is none comparable to Him.

nearer, since it takes place as a result of the words, ‘Be’ and it is (kun fa-yakun). Truly God has power 
over all things. And God brought you forth from the bellies of your mothers while you did not know anything

their wool, that is, the sheep’s, and their fur, that is, the camels’, and their hair, that is, the goats’, [He has 
made for you] furniture, chattels such as rugs and blankets, and wares, for you to use, for a while, until

people of Mecca, might submit, [that you might] affirm His Oneness. But if they turn away, [if] they rejed Islam, your duty, O Muhammad (s), is only to convey [ the

virtue, performance of the [religious] obligations, or that you should worship God as if you were able to 
see Him, as [reported] in the hadith; and giving to kinsfolk — He has singled it [kinship] out for mention 
by way of [highlighting] its importance — and He forbids lewdness, fornication, and abomination, with 
regard to the [Stipulations of the] Law, [abomination] such as disbelief and aCts of disobedience, and ag¬ 
gression, wrongdoing againSt people — He also singles this out for mention by way of [showing] its impor¬ 
tance; juSt as He began with [the mention of] ‘lewdness’, in this way, He admonishes you, through com¬ 
mands and prohibitions, so that you might remember, [that you might] be admonished ( tadhakkaruna, 
‘you [might] remember’, the original ta [of tatadhakkaruna] has been assimilated with the dhal). In the 
MuStadrak [of al-Hakim al-Naysaburl] it is reported from Ibn Mas'ud that [he said]: ‘This [verse] is the 
moSt comprehensive verse in the Qur’an in terms of [what is] good and [what is] evil’. And fulfil God’s covenant, [effected] byway of pledges of allegiance and oaths and in other ways, 
when you made a covenant, and do not break [your] oaths after pledging them and having made God 
surety over you, that you will fulfill [the covenant], for you have sworn [the oath] by Him (the sentence 
wa-qad jaaltumu’Lldha ‘alaykum kafilan, ‘and having made God surety over you’, is a circumstantial 
qualifier). Truly God knows what you do — [this is] a threat for them. And do not be like her who undoes. Spoils, her yarn, that which she has S]iun, after having made 
it Strong, [having] set and S]iun it, [breaking it up] into fibres ( ankdthan is a circumstantial qualifier, 
[ankdth is] the plural of nikth, and means that which is undone [yunkathu]) — this was an imbecile Mec¬ 
can woman who used to S]iin all day and then undo it — by making ( tattakhidhuna is a circumstantial 
qualifier referring to the person of [the verb] takunu, ‘[do not] be like’), in other words, [what is meant 
is] ‘do not be like her by making’, your oaths a [means of] deceit, ( dakhal, is what enters [yadkhulu] into 
something but does not belong to it), in other words, as [a means of causing] mischief or as trickery, 
between you, by breaking these [oaths], so that one group may become more numerous than [another] 
group. They used to enter into an alliance with a given group, but if they encountered another more 
numerous and more powerful [group], they would renege on their alliance with the former and forge 
a [new] alliance with these [latter]. God only tries, teSts, you thereby, in other words, by that which He 
enjoins, in the way of fulfilling the covenant, so that He may observe the obedient and the disobedi¬ 
ent among you, or when [it is the case that] one group is more numerous [than another], that He may 
observe whether you fulfil [your obligation to them] or not; and certainly He will make clear to you 
on the Day of Resurrection that wherein you used to differ, during [the life of] this world, with regard 
to covenants and otherwise, by punishing he who reneged and rewarding he who was faithful [to his 
covenant]. For if God had willed, He could have made you one community, people of a single religion, but 
He leads aStray whom He will and guides whom He will, and you will surely be questioned, on the Day of 
Resurrection, a questioning of rebuke, about what you used to do, so that you might be requited for it.","Allah enjoins justice, kindness, and giving relatives[56] [their dues], and He forbids shameful acts, evil deeds and oppression. He exhorts you, so that you may take heed. . Fulfill the covenant of Allah when you pledge, and do not break oaths after confirming them, having made Allah your witness, for Allah knows all what you do. . Do not be like the woman who unravels her yarn after spinning it firmly, by taking your oaths as a means of deceit between yourselves so that one party might gain an advantage over the other[57]. Allah only puts you to the test thereby[58], and on the Day of Resurrection, He will surely make clear to you all that over which you used to differ. . If Allah had willed, He would have made all of you a single community [of believers], but He causes to stray whom He wills and guides whom He wills[59], and you will surely be questioned about what you used to do.","[56] Degree of kinship: Parents, then offspring, then brothers and sisters, then paternal uncles and aunts, then maternal uncles and aunts, and then other relatives. .

16,94,97,"And do not make your oaths a [means of] deceit between you — He repeats this [here] for 
emphasis — leSl afoot should slip, that is, [leSt] your feet [should slip] off the path of Islam, after being 
Steady, having been set upon it, and [leSl] you should taSte evil, that is, ch a St i s e m ent, forasmuch as you 
barred [people] from the way of God, in other words, for your refraining to fulfil covenants or barring 
others from [doing] this, since your custom [once established] will be followed [by others], and there be 
a tremendous chastisement for you, in the Hereafter. And do not sell God’s covenant for a small price, of this world, so that you break it in return for 
this [small price]. For truly what is with God, of reward, is better for you, than all that is in this world — 
if you should know, this, then do not break it. That which is with you, of [the things of] this world, will come to an end, will perish, but that

those who ascribe partners to Him, that is, to God. And when We exchange a verse in place of a [ different] verse, by abrogating it and revealing an¬ 
other, for the welfare of [God’s] servants — and God knows bed what He reveals — they say, that is, the 
disbelievers [say] to the Prophet (s): ‘You arejud a fabricator’, a liar, making it up yourself. Nay, mod of 
them do not know, the true nature of the Qur’an and the benefit [to God’s servants] of abrogation. Say, to them: ‘The Holy Spirit, Gabriel, has revealed it from your Lord with truth ( bi’l-haqq, 
this is semantically connecfted to nazzala, ‘he [Gabriel] has revealed [it]’) to confirm [the faith of] those 
who believe, by their believing in it [when it is revealed], and as guidance and good tidings for those

He only has power over those who take him as their patron[64], and who - under his influence - associate partners with Allah. .

16,103,109,"And verily (wa-laqad is for confirmation) We know that they say, ‘It is only a human that is 
teaching him, the Qur’an — this was a Christian blacksmith whom the Prophet (s) used to frequent. 
God, exalted be He, says: The tongue, the language, of him to whom they refer, to whom they incline, 
[with the accusation] that he is [the one] teaching him, is foreign’; while this, Qur’an, is [in] a clear 
Arabic tongue, one of lucidity and clarity: so how can a foreigner be teaching him? 10 Indeed those who do not believe in God’s signs — God shall not guide them and there is a 
painfid chadisement for them. Only those invent falsehood who do not believe in God’s signs, the Qur’an, by saying that 
these are the words of a human, and it is they who are the liars (the emphasis is [effected] by way of 
repetition; 11 wa-inna, ‘and indeed’, and other [combinations of inna] are [used] in refutation of their say¬ 
ing, ‘You are jud a fabricator’ [above, Q. i6:ioi]) 12 . Whoever disbelieves in God after [having affirmed] his faith — except for him who is com¬ 
pelled, to pronounce [a statement of] unbelief and so pronounces it, while his heart is at red in faith

^Jionse [to this conditional], is [an implied] lahum waidun shadid, ‘there is for them a severe threat [of 
chastisement]’; this is indicated by [the Statement that follows]) — but he who opens up his bread to 
unbelief, that is, [he who] opens it up and expands it [with unbelief], meaning that his soul is content 
with it, upon such shall be wrath from God, and there is a great chadisement for them. That, threat [of chastisement] for them, is because they have preferred the life of this world, they 
have chosen it [in preference], to the Hereafter, and because God does not guide the disbelieving folk. 

9 Judging by his comment, Suyuti does take the superlative here, ahsan, literally, preferring to understand it simply as ‘good’, and 
thus as mere hyperbole. The translation of the verse, however, has been given in the literal sense. 

10 The expression ajaml specifically means non-Arab, or non-Arabic. 

11 The emphasis is of the fad that they are the liars, while the repetition is that of the third person plural: ulaika, ‘those’, and the 
tree standing pronoun hum , ‘they’. 

12 In this verse the Arabic contains an example of one such combination, innama.

well], and it is they who are heedless, of what [punishment] is being prepared for them.  Without a doubt — verily — in the Hereafter they are the ones who will be the losers, because 
their journeys end shall be the Fire, in which they shall be perpetually.","We surely know that they say, “It is only a human being who teaches him[67].” But the language they refer to is foreign, whereas this is eloquent Arabic language. . Those who do not believe in the verses of Allah, Allah will not guide them, and for them there will be a painful punishment. . No one fabricates lies except those who do not believe in the verses of Allah; it is they who are the liars. . Whoever disbelieves in Allah after having believed – except one who is compelled while his heart is firm in faith – but those who embrace disbelief willingly, upon them will be the wrath of Allah, and for them there will be a great punishment. . That is because they prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter, and Allah does not guide the disbelieving people. . These are the ones whose hearts, hearing and sight are sealed up by Allah[68]; it is they who are the heedless. . No doubt that it is they who will be the greatest losers in the Hereafter.",[67] The pagans of Makkah falsely claimed that a non-Arab teaches Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). .

people away from belief’), and then struggled and were patient, in obedience — indeed your Lord after 
that, that is, [after] such a trial, 13 is Forgiving, of them, Merciful, to them (the predicate of the fl rs't inna, 
‘indeed’, is indicated by the predicate of the second one). 14 Mention, the day when every soul will come pleading, arguing, for itself, not concerned for any 
other [soul] — this is the Day of Resurrection — and every soul will be repaid, the requital [of], what it 
has done and they will not be wronged, at all.","As for those who emigrated after being persecuted, then strove [for the cause of Allah], and were patient[69] – indeed, your Lord is after that All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. .

16,112,113,"And God strikes a similitude ( mathalan is substituted by [the following, qaryatan]) a town, 
Mecca — meaning its inhabitants — secure, from any raids, never becoming agitated, and peaceful, 
without anyone ever needing to emigrate from it, on account of anxiety or fear, its provision coming to 
it plenteously, abundantly, from every place. But it rejetted God’s graces, by denying the Prophet (s), so 
God made it tatte the garb of hunger, and so they suffered seven years of drought, and fear, as a result 
of the raiding parties of the Prophet (s), [all] because of what they used to do. And verily there came to them a messenger from among them, Muhammad (s), but they denied 
him, and so the chastisement, of hunger and fear, seized them while they were evildoers.","Allah presents an example of a town[70] that was safe and secure, receiving its provision in abundance from all directions. Yet its people showed ingratitude to Allah’s favors, so Allah made them taste overwhelming hunger and fear for what they used to do. . There came to them a messenger[71] from among themselves, but they rejected him, so the punishment seized them[72] while they were wrongdoers.","[70] i.e., Makkah. . [71] i.e., the Prophet (ﷺ).

16,114,119,"So eat, O believers, of the lawful and good food which God has provided you, and be thankful 
for God’s grace, if it is Him that you worship. He has forbidden you only carrion, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been hal¬ 
lowed to other than God. Yet whoever is compelled, neither craving nor transgressing, then truly God 
is Forgiving, Merciful. And do not say, concerning that which your own tongues qualify, falsehood [such as] ‘This 
is lawful, and this is unlawful’, for what God [respectively] has not made lawful, and what He has not 
made unlawful, in order to invent lies againtt God, by attributing such [claims] to Him. Truly those who 
invent lies againtt God will not prosper. For them [there will be], a brief enjoyment, in this world, and for them, in the Hereafter, there 
will be a painful chattisement. And to those of Jewry, that is, the Jews, We forbade that which We have related to you already, 
in the verse, And to those of Jewry We forbade every beatt with hoof... to the end [Q. 6:146]; and We did 
not wrong them, by forbidding [them] that, but they used to wrong themselves, by committing acfts of 
disobedience which necessarily bring about such [consequences]. Then indeed your Lord — to those who did evil, associating others [with God], out of igno¬ 
rance, and then repented, returned [to God’s way], after that and made amends, in their actions — 
indeed your Lord after that, that is, [after] that ignorance, or that repentance, is Forgiving, of them, 
Merciful, to them. 

13 The difficulty here is finding a suitable English translation of fitna; in the Arabic this term works with both readings, that is, 
whether one reads futinu or fatanii, the verbal noun is fitna. Thus, the reader has to bear in mind that the commentary is meant to 
be understood in one of the following ways: God is Forgiving of them after they suffered fitna, in other words, persecution; or He 
is Forgiving of them even when they had actually disbelieved, but had then returned to jihad and patience. 

14 In other words, the predicate is la-ghafurun rahitn, ‘Indeed He is Forgiving, Merciful’.

the Farthest Mosque, the Holy House [of Jerusalem], so called because of its distance from the former; 
the environs of which We have blessed, with fruits and rivers, that We might show him some of Our 
signs, the marvels of Our power. Indeed He is the Hearing, the Seeing, that is to say, the Knower of the 
Prophet’s (s) sayings and deeds. Thus He [God] was gracious to him by way of [carrying him on] the 
night journey, which comprised his encountering the [other] prophets, his ascension to heaven and the 
sight of the marvels of the [Divine] Realm and His communion, exalted be He, with him. For he [the 
Prophet] (s) said: ‘I was brought al-Buraq, a white animal, larger than a donkey but smaller than a mule; 
it was able to place its hoof [back] towards its extremity and so I mounted it. It set off carrying me until 
I reached the Holy House [of Jerusalem]. [There] I fastened the animal to the ring where the prophets 
fasten [their animals]. I then went in and prayed two units inside it. As I came out, Gabriel came to me 
with a jug of wine and a jug of milk, and so I chose the milk. Gabriel said [to me], “You have made the 
right choice [by choosing] the primordial nature (fitra )”.’ He [the Prophet] continued [the narration], 
‘We then ascended to the heaven of this world, whereat Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked, “Who 
are you?”. He replied, “Gabriel”, “And who is with you?” “Muhammad (s)”, he said. “Has he been sent 
for?” “Yes, he has been sent for”. Then it was opened for us, and lo! Adam Stood before me; he greeted 
me and prayed for well-being for me. We then ascended to the second heaven and Gabriel asked to be 
let in. Someone asked, “Who are you?”. He replied, “Gabriel”, “And who is with you?”, “Muhammad (s)”, 
he said. “Has he been called forth?”. “Yes, he has been called forth”. And it was opened up for us, and 
lo! there were the two [maternal] cousins, John and Jesus. They greeted me and prayed for well-being 
for me. We then ascended to the third heaven and Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked, “Who are 
you?”. He replied, “Gabriel”, “And who is with you?”, “Muhammad (s)” he said. “Has he been sent for?” 
it was asked. “Yes, he has been sent for”. And it was opened up for us, and lo! there was Joseph standing 
before me, and indeed he had been given one half of all beauty! He greeted me and prayed for well-being 
for me. We then ascended to the fourth heaven and Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked, “Who 
are you?” He replied, “Gabriel” “And who is with you?” “Muhammad (s)” he said. “Has he been called 
forth?” it was asked. “Yes, he has been called forth”, he replied. And it was opened up for us, and lo! there 
before me was Enoch (Idris). He greeted me and prayed for well-being for me. We then ascended to the 
fifth heaven and Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked, “Who are you?”. He replied, “Gabriel”. “And 
who is with you?” it was asked, “Muhammad (s)”, he replied. “Has he been sent for?” it was said. “Yes, 
he has been sent for”, he replied. And it was opened up for us, and lo! there before me was Aaron. He 
greeted me and prayed for well-being for me. We then ascended to the sixth heaven and Gabriel asked 
to be let in. Someone asked, “Who are you?”. He replied, “Gabriel”; “and who is with you?” “Muhammad 
(s)”, he said. “Has he been called forth?”, it was asked. “Yes, he has been called forth”. And it was opened 
up for us, and lo! there before me was Moses. He greeted me and prayed for well-being for me. We then 
ascended to the seventh heaven and Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked, “Who are you?”. He re¬ 
plied, “Gabriel”, “And who is with you?”; “Muhammad (s)”, he said. “Has he been called forth?”, it was 
asked. “Yes, he has been called forth”, he replied. And it was opened up for us, and lo! there before me 
was Abraham, leaning [seated] againSt the Frequented House ( al-bayt al-ma‘mur), into which 70,000 
angels enter every day never to return thereto. I was then taken to the Lote-Tree of the Boundary ( sidrat

beauty’. He [the Prophet] continued: ‘God then revealed to me what He revealed and prescribed for me 
fifty prayers each day and night . 3 1 then descended until I reached Moses and he said, “What has your 
Lord prescribed for your community?” I said, “Fifty prayers each day and night”. He said, “Go back to 
your Lord and ask Him for an alleviation, for your community will not have the capacity for it: I have 
tried the Children of Israel and have experience of them [not being up to the task].” I then went back to 
my Lord and said, “My Lord! Lighten that [prescription] for my community” and so He reduced it for 
me by five. I went back to Moses who asked me, “What did you do?” I said to him, ‘He has reduced it 
for me by five’, to which he said, “Your community will not have the capacity for this; so go back to your 
Lord and ask Him for an alleviation for your community”. Thus I kept going back and forth between my 
Lord and Moses, with Him reducing it by five each time until He said, “O Muhammad (s)! They shall be 
five prayers each day and night, every prayer will be worth [the reward of] ten [prayers]; that then makes 
fifty prayers. And whoever intends a good deed but does not perform it, I shall count it for him as one 
[done]; and if he performs it, I shall count it for him as ten; and whoever intends an evil deed, but does 
not perform it, it shall not be recorded against him; but if he performs it, it shall be recorded [only] as one 
evil deed”. I then descended until I reached Moses. I informed him and he said, “Go back to your Lord 
and ask Him for an alleviation for your community, because your community will not have the capacity 
for this”; and I said, “I have gone back to my Lord so many times that I am ashamed [to go again] ”. This 
[ hadlth ] is reported by the two Shaykhs [al-Bukharl and Muslim]; but the wording [of this version] is 
that of [the report in the Sahlh of] Muslim. Al-Hakim [al-Naysaburi] reports in the Muftadrak by way of 
Ibn ‘Abbas that he said, ‘The Prophet (s) said, “I did see my Lord, Mighty and Majestic”.’","Glory be to the One Who took His slave [Muhammad] by night from the Sacred Mosque [in Makkah] to the Aqsā Mosque [in Jerusalem] whose surroundings We have blessed, so that We may show him some of Our signs.

17,2,8,"God, exalted be He, says: And We gave Moses the Scripture, the Torah, and made it a guidance 
for the Children of Israel [saying] that they should not choose beside Me any guardian, to whom they 
delegate their affairs (a variant reading [for yattakhidhu, ‘they should [not] choose’] is tattakhidhu, ‘you 
should [not] choose’, thus turning away [from the third person address], in which case [the particle] an, 
‘that’ is extra and the ‘saying’ is implicit). O, descendants of those whom We carried with Noah, in the Ark. Indeed he was a grateful serv¬ 
ant, giving thanks to Us frequently, and offering praise in whichever .fiate he found himself. And We decreed, We revealed, to the Children of Israel in the Scripture, the Torah: ‘You shall 
indeed work corruption in the land, the land of Syria, through adts of disobedience, twice and you shall 
indeed become great tyrants’, you shall perpetrate grave injustice. So when the time for the fir & of the two [prophecies], the first of the two occasions for corruption, 
came, We roused against you servants of Ours of great might, men who are strong in war and assault, 
who ransacked, who came and went, seeking you out [through], [your] habitations, in the [very] mid,ft 
of your homes, in order to slay you and take [others among] you captive, and it was a promise fulfilled. 
Their firs't adt of corruption was their slaying of [the prophet] Zachariah. 4 So Goliath and his army were 
roused against them, and they slew them and took their children captive and destroyed the Holy House 
[of Jerusalem]. Then We gave you back the turn, the [rule of the] .‘State and vidtory, [to prevail] over them, one 
hundred years later, by having Goliath slain, and We aided you with children and wealth, and made you 
greater in number, in clan. And We said: ‘If you are virtuous, through [adts of] obedience, you are being virtuous to your 
own souls, since the reward thereof is for them [your souls]; and if you do evil, by way of [working] 
corruption, it is for them’, your evildoing. So when the time, the occasion, for the other [prophecy] 
comes. We will raise them forth, that they might ravage you, make you grieve through [their] slaying 
and taking captive [of you], a grief that will be manifest on your faces, and that they might enter the 
Temple, the Holy House [of Jerusalem], and destroy it, juft as they entered it, and destroyed it, the fir

prophet] John. 5 Thus Nebuchadnezzar was roused against them, and so he slew thousands of them and 
took their children captive and destroyed the Holy House [of Jerusalem]. And We said in the Scripture: It may be that your Lord will have mercy upon you, after the second 
time, if you were to repent; but if you revert, to [working] corruption, We [too] will revert, to punish¬ 
ment. And assuredly they did revert by denying the Prophet (5), and so he was given power over them, 
through the slaying of the [Banu] Qurayza, the expulsion of the [Banu] Nadir and the exacting of the 
jizya- tax from them; and We have made Hell a dungeon for the disbelievers, a place of detention and a 
prison [for them].","We gave Moses the Scripture and made it a guide for the Children of Israel, “Do not take besides Me anyone as a Disposer of Affairs[1]. . O descendants of those whom We carried [on board] with Noah[2]. He was indeed a grateful slave.” . We declared to the Children of Israel in the Scripture, “You will surely spread corruption on earth twice, and you will surely become exceedingly arrogant[3]. . When the first of the two warnings came to pass, We sent against you some of Our slaves of great might, and they ravaged through the land[4]; this warning was bound to be fulfilled[5]. . Then We gave you the upper hand over them and strengthened you with wealth and children, and made you greater in number. . If you do good, it is for your own good, but if you do evil, it is to your own loss. Then when the second warning came to pass, your enemies would disgrace and suppress you[6], and enter the Temple [of Jerusalem][7] as they entered it the first time, and utterly destroy whatever fell into their power[8]. . Your Lord may bestow mercy upon you, but if you return [to sin], We will return [to punishment][9]. And We have made Hell a prison for the disbelievers.”","[1] i.e., rely upon none except Allah, for He alone is the Disposer of Affairs of the whole universe. .

gives tidings to the believers who perform righteous deeds that there is a great reward for them. And, it [this Qur’an] informs, that those who do not believe in the Hereafter, We have prepared 
for them a painful chastisement, namely, the Fire. And man prays for ill, against himself and his family when he is frustrated, as [avidly as] he 
prays for good. And mankind is ever haSty , 6 to pray agai nsd himself, without contemplating the conse¬

17,12,17,"And We made the night and the day two signs, [both] indicators of Our power. Then We effaced 
the sign of the night, extinguishing its light with darkness, so that you might repose therein (the annexa¬ 
tion [ayata’layli, ‘the sign of the night’, is explicative), and made the sign of the day sight-giving, in other 
words, one in which it is possible to see because of the light; that you may seek, therein, bounty from 
your Lord, by earning [your livelihood], and that you may know, by both [day and night], the number 
of years and the reckoning, of the times [of the day], and everything, that might be needed, We have 
detailed very distinctly, We have explained clearly. And We have attached every person’s omen — his deeds — for him to carry, upon his neck — 
this [site] is singled out for mention because fastening [something] to it is [much] more severe; Mujahid 
[b. Jabr al-Makkl] said, ‘There is not a child born but it has a leaf around its neck in which it is decreed 
[that the child will be either] fortunate or damned’ — and We shall bring forth for him, on the Day of 
Resurrection, a book, in which his deeds are recorded [and], which he will find wide open ( yalqahu 
manshuran: both are adjectival qualifications of kitaban, ‘a book’). And it will be said to him: ‘Read your book! This day your soul suffices as your own reckoner’. Whoever is guided, is guided only to [the good of] his own soul, because the reward of his guid¬ 
ance will be for him; and whoever goes aStray, goes aStray only to its [his soul’s] detriment, because the 
sin thereof will be held against it. No burdened, [no] sinful, soul shall bear the burden of another, soul.

of Our messengers; but they fall into immorality therein, rebelling againsd Our command, and so the 
Word is justified concerning it, that it should be chastised, and We destroy it utterly. We annihilate it by 
annihilating its inhabitants and leaving it in ruins. How many — in other words, many — generations, communities, We have destroyed since 
Noah! And your Lord suffices as One Informed and Beholder of the sins of His servants, Knower of

for him, in the Hereafter, Hell, to which he will be exposed, [to which] he will be admitted, condemned, 
blameful, and rejected, banished from [God’s] mercy. And whoever desires the Hereafter and Strives for it with the necessary effort, [that is] he per¬

Lord’s bounty, in this world. And your Lord’s bounty, therein, is not confined, [it is not] forbidden to 
anyone. See how We have given preference to some of them over others, in provision and renown. And 
truly the Hereafter is greater, grander, in degrees and greater in preferment, to this world, and so one 
ought to devote one’s attention to it [the Hereafter], to the exclusion of the other.","Whoever desires this fleeting life[16], We hasten therein whatever We will to whoever We please. Then We prepare for him Hell, which he will enter, despised and rejected. . But whoever desires the Hereafter and strives for it as he should, being a believer – it is those whose efforts will be appreciated[17]. .

show, kindness to parents, by being dutiful to them. If they should reach old age with you, one of them 
(ahaduhuma is the subjed [of the verb]) or both (a variant reading [for yablughanna ] has yablughan, 
‘both [should] reach’, in which case ahaduhuma would be substituting for the [dual indicator] alif [of

on me when [they], reared me when I was little’. Your Lord knows be ft what is in your hearts, [in the way] of what may be concealed of dutiful¬ 
ness or disobedience [to parents]. If you are righteous, obedient to God, then truly, to those who are 
penitent, those who return to obedience of Him, He is Forgiving, of any slip that might have issued on 
their part regarding their duty to the parents, so long as they do not conceal [within themselves] any 
disreSJied [towards them], And give the kinsman his due, of dutifulness and kindness, and the needy and the traveller [as 
well]; and do not squander, by expending for [any purpose] other than in obedience to God. Indeed squanderers are brothers of devils, that is, they follow their way, and the Devil was ever 
ungrateful to his Lord, extremely rejedive of His graces: likewise his brother the squanderer. But if you [have to] overlook them, that is, the kinsmen and the others mentioned, and do not 
give to them, seeking mercy from your Lord, [a mercy] which you expeft [in the future], that is, [you 
do not give to them] because of a request for provision which you are waiting to come to you [from 
your Lord], before you give to them, then fpeak to them gentle words, pleasant and reasonable [words], 
promising them that you will give to them when the provision [from God] arrives. And do not keep your hand chained to your neck, in other words, do not withhold it completely 
from expending, nor open it, in order to expend, completely, or you will sit blameworthy — this refers 
to the fird case — and denuded, cut off, having nothing — this refers to the latter case.

Sura al-Isra Truly your Lord expands provision. He makes it abundant, for whomever He will and He Strait¬ 
ens, He resdridts it for whomever He will. Indeed He is ever Aware and Seer of His servants, Knower of 
what they hide and what they manifest, giving them provision in accordance with their welfare.","Do not set up with Allah any other god, or else you will be despised and forsaken[20]. . Your Lord has ordained that you worship none but Him, and show kindness to parents.

Give relatives their due, and the needy and the stranded travelers, and do not spend wastefully. . Indeed, the wasteful are Satans’ brothers[24], and Satan is ever ungrateful to his Lord[25]. . But if you must turn away from [those in need] while hoping to receive bounty from your Lord[26], then say to them words of comfort. . Do not be too tight-fisted[27], nor too open-handed[28], for you will end up blameworthy and destitute. . Your Lord extends provision to whom He wills or restricts it[29].

17,31,35,"And do not slay your children, by burying them alive, fearing penury, poverty. We shall provide 
for them and for you. Slaying them is truly a great sin. And do not come [anywhere] near fornication — this [form of expressing it] is more effective 
than [saying] ‘Do not commit it’. It is indeed an indecency, an abomination, and, it is, an evil way. And do not slay the soul [whose life] God has made inviolable, except with due cause. Whoever 
is slain wrongfully, We have certainly given his heir, the one inheriting from him, a warrant, a sanction 
[to retaliate] against the slayer; but let him not commit excess, [let him not] overstep the bounds, in slay¬ 
ing, by slaying other than the killer [of the one slain], or by other than that [instrument] with which he 
[the slain] was killed; for he is supported [by the Law]. And do not come [anywhere] near an orphan’s property, except in the fairest manner until he 
comes of age. And fulfil the covenant, should you make a covenant with God or with people [in general]. 
Indeed the covenant will be enquired into. And give full measure, complete it, when you measure, and weigh with a right balance, [with]

Do not go near adultery[31], for it is indeed a shameful act and an evil way. . Do not kill any soul that Allah has forbidden, except in the course of justice. If anyone is killed wrongfully, We have given his heir authority [of compensation], but he should not exceed the bounds in killing, for he is already supported [by law]. . Do not approach the property of an orphan except with good [intent][32], until he reaches maturity; and fulfill the covenant, for you will certainly be questioned about the covenant. . Give full measure when you measure, and weigh with accurate scales; that is fair and best in the end[33].","[30] Abdullāh ibn Mas‘ūd (رضي الله عنه) reported: “I said: “O Messenger of Allah, what is the greatest sin?” He said: “That you set up rivals with Allah, when He is the One Who created you!” Then I said: “What is next?” He said: “That you kill your child because he eats with you!” [Al-Bukhāri: 6811]. .

not rend the earth, [you will not] pierce it and reach its depths with your pride, nor attain the mountains 
in height: the meaning is that you shall never attain such ends, so how can you be so arrogant? Allofthat, [which has been] mentioned— the evil of it is hateful in the sight of your Lord. This is [part] of the wisdom, the admonition, which your Lord has revealed to you, O Muhammad

So he went to him and recited Surat al-Fātihah and blew over him. The chief was invigorated and went on walking with no sign of ailment. They gave them the agreed reward. Some of the Companions said: “Let us divide it!” Others said: “Do not, until you reach the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), tell him what has happened and see what he bids us do”. They went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and told him. He said: “How did you come to know that it can be used as ruqyah? You have done the right thing. Divide it and allocate a share for me” [al-Bukhārī: 5749; Muslim: 2201]. ‘Ā’ishah (رضي الله عنه) narrated that: “When ill, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to recite al-Mu‘awwidhāt (the Sheltering surahs, al-Falaq and al-Nās) and blow.

Am I anything but a human, sent as a messenger?” . Nothing prevented people from believing when guidance came to them except that they said, “Has Allah sent a human as a messenger?” . Say, “If there had been angels walking on earth peacefully, We would have certainly sent down to them from the heaven an angel as a messenger.” . Say, “Allah is Sufficient as a witness between me and you. He is indeed All-Aware, All-Seeing of His slaves.”","[80] Showing miracles are of no use, even if it is catastrophic to them."

find for them [any] guardians, to guide them, besides Him. And We shall assemble them on the 
Day of Resurrection, walking, on their faces, blind, dumb, and deaf; their abode shall be Hell — 
whenever it abates, [whenever] its flames subside, We shall intensify for them the blaze, the flame 
and [its] burning. That is their requital because they disbelieved Our signs and said, in denial of the Resurrection:

Sura al-Isra 


‘What, when we are bones and fragments, shall we really be raised in a new creation?’ Have they not seen, realised, that God, [He] Who created the heavens and the earth, with all 
their immensity, has the power to create the like of them?, that is, [the like of] these human beings, [es¬ 
pecially] given their smallness? He has appointed for them a term, until [the time for their] death and 
resurrection, whereof is no doubt; yet the wrongdoers insist on disbelief, on denial of such [a term]. Say, to them: ‘Ifyou possessed the treasuries of my Lord’s mercy, [those treasuries] of provision 
and rain, you would surely withhold [them], [you would] Hint, for fear of spending, fearing that they 
would be depleted if [one] ^Jient [from them] and [that] you would then become impoverished; 13 and 
man is ever niggardly’.","Whoever Allah guides is truly guided; and whoever He causes to stray, you will find none to protect them besides Him. On the Day of Resurrection, We will gather [and drag] them on their faces – deaf, dumb and blind. Their abode will be Hell; every time it subsides, We will flare it up for them[81]. . That will be their recompense because they rejected Our verses and said, “What! When we are turned into bones and crumbled particles, will we really be raised as a new creation?” . Do they not see that Allah, Who created the heavens and earth, is able to create the like of them? He has decreed for them an appointed time, about which there is no doubt, yet the wrongdoers persist in denial. . Say, “If you were to own the treasuries of my Lord’s mercy, you would surely hold them back for fear of spending, for man is ever miserly.”",[81] As a consequence of his own preference.
17,101,104,"And verily We gave Moses nine manifest signs, clear [signs], namely, [those of] the hand, the 
£taff, the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs, the blood and the obliteration [of their possessions, cf. Q. 
10:88], the years [of dearth] and scarcity of fruits [cf. Q. 7:130]. 14 Ask, O Muhammad (s), the Children of 
Israel, about this (a [rhetorical] question meant as an affirmation for the idolaters of your sincerity; or [it 
means that] We said to him [Muhammad, s], ‘Ask’; a variant reading has the pa^t tense \fa-saala, ‘and he 
asked’]), 15 when he came to them, Pharaoh said to him, ‘O Moses, I truly think that you are bewitched’, 
duped, your mind deceived. He [Moses] said, ‘Indeed you know that none revealed these, signs, except the Lord of the heav¬ 
ens and the earth, as proofs, lessons; however, you are being stubborn (a variant reading [for ' alimta, 
‘you know’] has ‘alimtu [‘I know’]); 16 and I truly think that you, O Pharaoh, are doomed’, [that you] 
will be destroyed — or [it, mathburan, means that Pharaoh has been] turned away from [all deeds that 
are] good. And he. Pharaoh, desired to scare them, to expel Moses and his people, from the land, the land 
of Egypt; so We drowned him and those with him, all together. And after him We said to the Children of Israel, ‘Dwell in the land; but when the promise of 
the Hereafter, namely, the Hour, comes to pass, We shall bring you [gathered] in mixed company’, all 
together, you and them.","We gave Moses nine clear signs. Ask the Children of Israel when he came to them, Pharaoh said to him, “O Moses, I certainly think that you are bewitched[82].” . Moses said, “You already know that none sent down these [signs] except the Lord of the heavens and earth as clear proofs, and I certainly think that you, O Pharaoh, are doomed!” . So he decided to exile them out of the land, but We drowned him and all those who were with him. . Thereafter[83] We said to the Children of Israel, “Dwell in the land, but when the promise of the Hereafter comes, We will bring you all together.”",[82] Makkans are warned by his example not to hasten their punishment by asking for miracles that they would not believe. . [83] After the drowning of Pharaoh and his people.
17,105,111,"With the truth have We revealed it, that is, the Qur’an, and with the truth, it comprises, has it 
been revealed, in the way it has, unaffecfted by any alterations; and We have not sent you, O Muhammad 
(s), except as a bearer of good tidings, of Paradise, for those who believe, and as a Warner, of the Fire, 
for those who disbelieve. And [it is] a Qur’an (qur’anan is in the accusative because of the verb governing it [which is the 
following]) that We have divided, that We have revealed in portions over 20 or 23 years, that you may 
recite it to mankind at intervals, gradually and with deliberateness so that they [are able to] comprehend 
it, and We have revealed it by [successive] revelation, one part after another, according to what is best 
[for mankind]. Say, to the disbelievers of Mecca, ‘Believe in it or do not believe, as a threat to them; indeed 
those who were given knowledge before it, before its revelation, namely, the believers from among the 
People of the Scripture, when it is recited to them, fall down in prostration on their faces, and say, “Glory be to our Lord, exalting Him above [the claim] that [His] promise [of sending a 
prophet] had not been fulfilled. Indeed (in, softened) Our Lord’s promise, of its [the Qur’an’s] revelation 

13 This seems to be the correct reading (fa-taftaqiru ), given the overall sense, although the reader should note that some editions 
might have the reading fa-tuqattiril, ‘you will therefore be niggardly’. 

14 These laft two should be taken as one sign. 

15 This is not a reading recognised by Ibn Mujahid’s seven readers. It would be difficult to maintain the Prophet Muhammad as the 
subjedt of the verb in this case, and so the sense might be that Moses posed the question to the Children of Israel concerning (the 
truth of?) the nine signs given to him by God. 

16 In other words, it is Moses who knows that these signs are from God.

and the sending of the Prophet (s), is bound to be fulfilled”. And they fall down on their faces, weeping (yabkuna is a supplement [to yakhirruna, ‘they fall 
down] also containing an adjectival qualification [of those falling down]); and it, the Qur’an, increases 
them in humility’, in humbleness before God. The Prophet (s) would often say, ‘O God, O Compassionate One’. So they said, ‘He [Muhammad, 
s] forbids us to worship more than one god, and yet he calls upon another [god] together with Him 
[God]’. The following was then revealed: Say, to them: ‘Invoke God or invoke the Compassionate One, 
that is to say, invoke Him by either of these [Names] or call upon Him by saying, ‘O God! O Compassion¬ 
ate One!’, whichever ( ayyan is conditional; md is extra), in other words, whichever of these two [Names], 
you invoke, is beautiful — this [predicate, ‘beautiful’] is indicated by the following [Statement]), to Him, 
to the One called by these two [Names], belong the Moil Beautifid Names’, these two [Names] being 
from among them; and they [the other Names] are [the following] as [mentioned] in haditk. God, there 
is no god except Him, the Compassionate, the Merciful, the King, the Holy, the Peace, the Securer, the

be He, says: And do not be loud in your prayer, when you recite [the Qur’an] therein, leSt the idolaters 
hear you and curse you, as well as the Qur’an and the One Who has revealed it; nor be silent, do [not] 
murmur, therein, so that your companions might [be able to hear it and] benefit [therefrom]; but seek 
between that, loudness and silence, a, middle, way. And say: ‘Praise be to God, Who has neither taken a son, nor has He any partner in sover¬ 
eignty, in divineness, nor has He [taken] any ally, to assist Him, out of, because of [any], weakness’, that 
is to say, He would never become weak and thus need an assistant. And magnify Him with magnifica¬ 
tions [worthy of Him], extol Him with a perfecft extolling above that He should have taken a son or a 
partner, and [above] any weakness and [above] all that does not befit Him. The arrangement whereby 
‘praise’ is [invoked] together with this [Statement] is meant to indicate that He is the One worthy of all 
praise, because of the perfection of His Essence and the faCt that He alones possesses those attributes of 
His. Imam Ahmad [b. Hanbal] relates in his Musnad [by way of a report] from Mu'adh al-Juhanl [who 
heard it] from the Messenger of God (5), who used to say, ‘The “glory” verse [in the Qur’an] is: Praise be 
to God, Who has neither taken a son, nor has He any partner in sovereignty ... to the end [of the above- 
mentioned sura, 17:111]’, and God, exalted be He, knows beSt. 

The author of this [commentary] says, ‘This [laSt commentary] constitutes the end of my com¬ 
plement to the commentary on the Noble Qur’an composed by the inquisitive scholar, the shaykh. Imam 
Jalal al-Dln al-Mahalll al-Shafi‘1, may God be pleased with him. I have expended every effort in it and 
reflected throughout it exhaustively, [especially] in those precious things that I have deemed, God will¬

Spoken to by God [sc. Moses] 17 and I have made it a means to attaining the Gardens of Bliss. It [this com¬

standing of] those allegorical verses. 18 May God have mercy on one who examines it with impartiality, 
chances upon an error and informs me of it. As I have said: 

“I praise God, my Lord, for He guided me in what I have expressed depute my incapacity and 
weakness; for who [other than God] is there to avert me from error and who is there to accept from me 
even a single letter”. 

In faCt, it never occurred to me to embark upon such [a task], knowing that I was incapable of 
delving into such issues. Perhaps God will make it of ample profit [to others] and through it open sealed 
hearts, blinded eyes and deaf ears. I have the impression that I am before those [sort of readers] who 
would prefer works of prolixity, refraining from [referring to] this complementary work, rejecting it 
outright, tending to obvious obstinacy [regarding it], without addressing its intricacies with any under¬ 
standing: And whoever is blind in this world shall be blind in the Hereafter [Q. 17:72]. May God thereby 
provide us with a [way of] guidance to the path of truth, with success, an awareness of the subtle intrica¬ 
cies of His words and with an ascertainment. May He thereby also make us with those to whom God has 
been gracious from among the prophets and the truthful and the martyrs and the righteous — and excellent 
companions are they! [Q. 4:69]. He [Jalal al-Dln al-Suyutl] completed the composition of this [work] on 
Sunday, 10 th of Shawwal, in the year 870 (AH) [1465 AD], having commenced it on the firSt Wednes¬ 
day of Ramadan of the same year. He completed the fair copy [of this work] on Wednesday, 6 th of Safar 
in the year 871 (AH) [1466 AD], and God knows beSt. Shaykh Shams al-Dln Muhammad b. Abi Bakr 
al-Khatlb al-Tukhl said: my friend the erudite shaykh Kamal al-Dln al-Mahalll, brother of the above- 
mentioned shaykh of ours, shaykh Jalal al-Dln al-Mahalll, may God have mercy on both of them, that he 
saw his brother, the above-mentioned shaykh Jalal al-Dln, in his dream: before him Stood our friend the 
inquiring erudite scholar shaykh Jalal al-Din al-Suyutl, compiler of this complement. He [Mahalll] had 
this complement in his hand and, perusing it, he was saying to its above-mentioned compiler [SuyutI], 
‘Which of the two is better, my composition or yours?’. He [SuyutI] said, ‘Mine’. He [Mahalll] then said, 
‘But look at this ...’, and he showed him parts of it, politely pointing out to him his objections thereto. 
Each time he [Mahalll] brought something up, the compiler of this complement [SuyutI] would respond 
to him, while shaykh [Mahalll] would smile and laugh. Our shaykh, the imam, the erudite scholar Jalal 
al-Dln ‘Abd al-Rahman b. Abi Bakr al-Suyutl, compiler of this complement said: What I believe, and 
what I am absolutely certain of, is that the part composed by shaykh Jalal al-Dln al-Mahalll, may God 
have mercy on him, in his section [of the commentary] is actually better than mine by far. How [could it 
be otherwise], when most of what I have written here draws on his work and relies on it? I have no doubt 
about this. As regards what was seen in the above-mentioned dream, then perhaps it is the case that the 
shaykh meant to point out those few places in which I disagreed with what he had written on account of 
some little comment [that I had made therein]. But these [instances] are very few and I do not think that 
they add up to more than ten such instances. Among these is where shaykh [al-Mahalll] comments in 
siirat Sad : 19 ‘The Spirit is a delicate organism (jism latif) that gives life to a human being by permeating it’. 
I followed this [opinion] at firSt, but then I remembered the restriction [made by God] while [working on 
the commentary] at siirat al-Hijr; 2 ° and so I erased it because of where God says, And they will question 
you concerning the Spirit. Say, 'The Spirit is of the command of my Lord. And of knowledge you have not 
been given except a little [...]’ [to the end of] the verse [Q. 15:85]. For, it is explicit, or almoSt explicit, in 
Stating that the [true nature of the] Spirit is of God’s knowledge [only], exalted be He — we do not know 
it. Thus, it is better that we should refrain from trying to define it. For this reason also, shaykh Taj al-Dln 
b. al-Subkl says in [his work] Jam‘ al-jawami‘ (The compendium of compendiums’): ‘As for the Spirit, 
Muhammad (s) never SJioke about it and we should [also] therefore refrain [from Sneaking about it].’ An¬ 
other [instance] 21 is where the shaykh says in [his commentary to] siirat al-Hajj [Q. 22:17],‘The Sabaeans 
( al-sabi’un ) are a Jewish seCf. I mention this in [my commentary to] siirat al-Baqara [Q. 2:62], where I 
added the following [gloss] ‘or [they are] a Christian [seCt]’, in order to point out a variant opinion, gen¬ 
erally acknowledged, particularly by our colleagues, the [Shafi‘1] jurists, and [also acknowledged] by the

together his complementary commentary to form the Tafsir al-Jalalayn.

20 Possibly, when SuyutI had reached Q. 15:29, because of the reference therein to Adam’s 3 j)irit.

Minhaj (‘The Method [...]’)> 22 where it is stated that the Samaritans opposed the Jews and the Sabaeans 
[opposed] the Christians [respectively] over the fundamentals of their religion. In his [Mahallis] Shark 
(‘Commentary’), 23 al-Shafi‘I, may God be pleased with him, is reported to have said that the Sabaeans 
were a Christian seCt. At this moment, I cannot recall a third instance [of Mahalli’s objections]. Perhaps 
these are the sort of examples which the Shaykh, may God have mercy on him, was pointing out [in the 
dream]. And God knows beSt what is correCt, and to Him is the return and the [final] resort.

Meccan, except for verses 28, and from [verses] 82 to the end of 101, which are Medinese; it consists of 
110 or 115 verses, revealed after surat al-Ghashiya. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","With the truth We have sent down this [Qur’an] and with the truth it has descended[84], and We have not sent you [O Prophet] except as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner. . This is a Qur’an that We have revealed over stages so that you may recite it to people at a slower pace, and We have sent it down in a successive manner[85]. . Say, “Believe in it, or do not believe. Those who were given knowledge before it[86], when it is recited to them, they fall on their faces in prostration, . and they say, “Glory be to our Lord. The promise of our Lord is bound to be fulfilled.” . They fall down on their faces weeping, and it increases their humility.” . Say, “Call upon Allah or call upon the Most Compassionate[87] – whichever name you call, to Him belong the Most Beautiful Names.” Do not be too loud in your prayer, nor too quiet, but seek a way in between[88]. . And say, “All praise is for Allah Who has not taken a son, nor does He have any partner in His dominion, nor does He need any protector out of weakness. And proclaim His greatness immensely.”","[84] It is repeated twice in the face of the ardent denial of the pagans of Makkah and their demand to provide them with miracles, asserting here that the Qur’an is a revelation from Allah: it contains truthful news and just rulings, as it is sent down by Gabriel (عليه السلام), the strong and trustworthy, to Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), safeguarded against the devils, free from alteration, additions or omission, throughout all times. . [85] In separate segments, one coming after another over the duration of 23 years of his mission. . [86] Of the People of the Book who recognize the truth. . [87] The Makkans heard the Prophet (ﷺ) praying to Allah, once as Allah and on another occasion as Al-Rahmān, and claimed that he was praying to two different gods. [Majmū‘ al-Fatāwā, Ibn Taymiyyah, 14:15] Both are two Names for Allah, the One and Only God.
 [88] Abdullāh ibn Abbās (رضي الله عنهما) reported the reason behind the revelation of this verse: “It came down when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was lying low in Makkah. When he used to lead his Companions in Prayer and raise his voice and the pagans heard him, they would curse the Qur’an and He Who sent it down. So Allah said to His Messenger: “Do not raise your voice is Prayer upon which the pagans would hear you, yet not too quiet that your Companions may not hear you. Make them hear the Qur’an but do not raise your voice to that extent; seeking a middle way between them.” [Al-Bukhārī: 4722; Muslim: 446]."
18,1,6,"Praise — which is the attribution [to a person] of that which is beautiful — is established [as 
something that], belongs to God [alone], exalted be He. Now, is the intention here to point this out for 
the purpose of believing in it, or to praise [God] thereby, or both? All are possibilities, the most profitable 
of which is [to understand] the third [as being the intention behind this Statement]; Who has revealed 
to His servant, Muhammad (s), the Book, the Qur’an, and has not allowed for it, that is, [He has not al¬ 
lowed that there be] in it, any crookedness, [any] variance or contradiction (the [laSt] sentence [wa-lam

of, to make, by this Book, the disbelievers fear, severe chastisement from Him, from God, and to bring 
to the believers who perform righteous deeds the good tidings that theirs will be a fair reward, wherein they will abide forever, and this [reward] is Paradise; and to warn those, from among the disbelievers, who say, ‘God has taken a son’. They do not have, in this, in this saying, any knowledge, nor did their fathers, before them, who 
[also] used to say this. Dreadful, grave, is the word that comes out of their mouths ( kalimatan, ‘word’, is 
for Specification and it explains the unidentified [feminine] person [of the verb, kaburat, ‘dreadful’]; and 
that which is the object of censure has been omitted, and that is their above-mentioned saying [that God 
has taken a son]). They Speak nothing, thereby, but, an utterance of, lies. Yet it may be that you will consume, destroy, yourself in their wake — following [your being with] 
them, that is, after they have left you — if they should not believe in this discourse, [in this] Qur’an, out 
of grief, out of rage and anguish on your part, because of your eagerness that they believe ( asafan, ‘out of 
grief’, is in the accusative because it functions as an objeCt denoting reason).","All praise be to Allah Who has sent down upon His slave the Book, and has not allowed any crookedness therein[1], . an upright Book, to warn of severe punishment from Him[2], and to give glad tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds, that they will have a good reward, . wherein they will abide forever; . and to warn those who say, “Allah has begotten a son[3].” . They have no knowledge of it, nor did their forefathers[4]. What a monstrous word that comes out of their mouths! They say nothing but lies. . Perhaps you will grieve yourself to death [O Prophet] over them[5] if they do not believe in this message[6].","[1] From the straight path or from the truth. .

And We will surely turn all that is on it into a barren land[7].","[7] It shows the transient nature of life in this world, so one should invest in it for what comes after death."
18,9,16,"Or did you think, did you suppose, that the Companions of the Cave, the cavern in the mountain, 
and the Inscription, the tablet wherein their names and lineages had been inscribed — the Prophet (s) 
had been asked about their tale — were, with regard to their tale, a [unique] marvel from among, the 
entirety [of], Our signs? (‘ ajaban, ‘a marvel’ is the predicate of [the defective verb] kana [sc. kanu], the 
preceding [min dydtina, ‘from among Our signs’] being a circumdantial qualifier). In other words, [did 
you suppose] that they were a marvel exclusively from among all [Our] other signs, or that they were the 
mod marvellous among them? Not so. Mention, when the youths took refuge in the Cave (fitya, ‘youths’, is the plural of fata, and de¬ 
notes a mature young man) fearing for their faith from their disbelieving people, they said, ‘Our Lord! 
Give us mercy from Yourself and remedy for us our affair through reditude’, [through Your] guidance. So We smote their ears, that is, We made them sleep, in the Cave for several years, for a [fixed]

We will never call upon any god other than Him, or we would be uttering an outrageous lie[10].” . These people of ours have taken besides Him other gods. Why do they not bring clear proof about them? Who does greater wrong than one who fabricates lies against Allah? . When you have distanced yourselves from them and what they worship other than Allah, take refuge in the cave; your Lord will extend His mercy to you and make for you an easy way out of your ordeal.”","[8] Rather, there are many other wonders of Allah such as the creation of heavens and earth. . [9] The youths have sought refuge in the cave for the sake of their religion, so they asked Allah to keep them firm on the straight path. . [10] i.e., too far away from the Truth."
18,17,20,"And you might have seen the sun, when it rose, inclining (read tazzawaru or tazdwaru ) 2 away 
from their Cave towards the right, side of it, and, when it set, go paSt them on the left, avoid them and 
pass over them, so that it does not fall on them at all, while they were in a cavern therein, in an ample 
,<]iace inside the Cave where the coolness and the gentle breeze of the winds reached them. That, which is 
mentioned, was [one] of God’s signs, [one of] the proofs of His power. Whomever God guides, he indeed 
is rightly guided, and whomever He leads aStray, you will not find for him a guiding friend. And you would have supposed them — had you seen them — awake, that is, conscious, because 
their eyes were open ( ayqdz, ‘awake’, is the plural of yaqiz), though they were asleep ( ruqud is the plural 
of rdqid ). And We caused them to turn over to the right and to the left, led the earth consume their flesh, 
and their dog [lay] stretching its forelegs, his paws, on the threshold, at the opening of the cave: when¬ 
ever they turned over it would turn over jud like them, both during sleep and consciousness. If you had 
observed them you woidd have turned away from them inflight and you woidd have been filled (read 
la-mulli’ta or la-muli’ta) with awe because of them (read ruban or ru’uban, ‘awe’): [it was] through this 
awe that God protected them from anyone entering upon them. And so, jud as We did with them that which We have mentioned, it was that We aroused them. 
We awakened them, that they might question one another, concerning their date and the length of their 
day [in the cave]. One of them said, ‘How long have you tarried?’ They said, ‘We have tarried a day, or 
part of a day’: [he said this] because they had entered the cave at sunrise and were awakened at sunset, 
and so they thought that it was [the time of] sunset on the day of their entry. Then, they said, unsure 
about this [facft], ‘Your Lord knows beSt how long you have tarried. Now send one of you with this silver 
coin of yours (read bi-warqikum or bi-wariqikum ) to the city — which is said to be the one now called 
Tarsus ( Tarasus ) — and let him see which is the purest food, that is, which of the foods of the city is 
the pured, and [let him] bring you a supply thereof. Let him be careful and not make anyone

aware of you . 3 For indeed if they should come to know of you, they will [either] Hone you, kill you by atoning, 
or make you return to their creed, and then, if you do return to their creed, you will never prosper’.","You would have seen the sun when it rose, it would incline away from their Cave to the right; and when it set, it would turn away from them to the left[11], while they were in its open space. That was one of the signs of Allah. Whoever Allah guides is rightly guided, and whoever He causes to stray, you will never find for him a protecting guide. . You would have thought they were awake, although they were asleep. We turned them over on their right and left sides, when their dog stretched its forelegs at the entrance. If you had seen them, you would have fled away from them, filled with horror[12]. . Similarly, We awakened them so that they might question one another. One of them said, “How long have you been here?” They said, “We have been here for a day or part of a day.” They said, “Your Lord knows best how long have you been here. Send one of you with these silver coins of yours to the city, and let him see who has the most pure food and bring some provision from it. And be cautious and let no one know about you. . For if they find out about you, they will stone you or force you back to their religion, and then you will never succeed.”","[11] As such they would get all the air and ventilation they needed to sustain. . [12] Should anyone were to see them, he would see a group of awake men with a dog standing guarding them, and would surely be filled with horror, which was a factor in preserving them, so no one would dare to draw close to them."
18,21,22,"And so, juff as We aroused them, it was that We disclosed them, [to] their people and the believ¬ 
ers, that they, that is, their people, might know that God’s promise, of resurrection, is true: by virtue of 
the facft that One Who has the power to make them sleep for [such] a long period of time, or sustain 
them in that .hate without nourishment, also has the power to resurred the dead; and that, as for the 
Hour, there is no doubt, no uncertainty, concerning it. Behold ( idh adverbially qualifies a’tharna, ‘We 
disclosed’) they were disputing, that is, the believers and the disbelievers, among themselves their affair, 
the affair of the youths, with regard to building something around them [as a monument]; so they, the 
disbelievers, said, ‘Build over them, that is, around them, a building, to cover them up; their Lord knows 
them betf.’ Those who prevailed regarding their affair, the affair of the youths, namely, the believers, ‘We 
will verily set up over them, around them, a place of worship’, for prayers to be performed therein. 4 And 
this indeed took place at the entrance of the cave. I 7 i ey will say, that is, [some of] those diluting the number of the youths [of the cave] at the time 
of the Prophet (s), in other words, some of these will say that they [the youths] were: ‘Three; their dog the 
fourth of them’; and they, some [others] among them, will say, ‘Five; their dog the sixth of them’ — both 
of these sayings were those of the Christians of Najran — guessing at random, in other words, out of sup¬ 
position, not having been present with them [at the time], and this [Statement ‘guessing at random’] re¬ 
fers back to both sayings, and is in the accusative because it is an objed denoting reason, in other words, 
[they said this] for the reason that they were [merely] supposing it. And they, that is, the believers, will 
say, ‘Seven; and their dog the eighth of them’ (the sentence is [part of] the subjed clause, the predicate 
of which is the adjectival qualification of sab’a, ‘seven’ [namely, thaminuhum, ‘the eighth of them’] with 
the additional wow [wa-thaminuhum], which is said to be for emphasis, or an indication that the adjec¬ 
tive is [semantically] attached to that which it is qualifying). The qualification of the firff two sayings as 
being ‘random’, but not the third, is proof that [the latter] is the satisfactory and correct [number]. Say: 
‘My Lord knows beil their number, and none knows them except a few’: Ibn ‘Abbas said, ‘I am [one] of 
these “few” [described]’, and he mentioned that they were seven. So do not contend concerning them 
except with an outward manner [of contention], [except] with that which has been revealed to you, and 
do not question concerning them, do not ask for opinions [from], any of them, [from] the People of the 
Scripture, the Jews. The people of Mecca asked him [the Prophet] about the ffory of the People of the 
Cave, and so he said to them, ‘I will tell you about it tomorrow’, but without adding [the words], ‘If God 
wills’ (insha a’ Llahu) and so the following was revealed:","This is how We made their case known so that the people might know that the promise of Allah is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour. When they were disputing among themselves[13] concerning their matter [of resurrection], they said, “Build a structure over them. Their Lord knows best about them.” Those who prevailed in their matter said, “We will surely build over them a place of worship.” . Some will say, “They were three, their dog was the fourth,” while others will say, “They were five, their dog was the sixth,” – merely guessing at the unseen. And others will say, “They were seven, their dog was the eighth.” Say, “My Lord knows best their number; no one knows about them except a few[14]. So do not argue about them except in a brief manner, nor ask anyone about them.”","[13] i.e., the inhabitants of the city. . [14] i.e., that which is the sure argument, one in the Qur’an."
18,23,24,"Mid never say regarding something, that is, for the purpose of [doing] something, ‘I will indeed 
do that tomorrow’, in other words, [I will do something] at some future [point] in time, without [adding], ‘If God will’, in other words, unless [firmly] adhering to the will of God, 
exalted be He, by saying, ‘If God will’ (insha a’Llah). And remember your Lord, that is, [remember] His 
will, making [things] conditional on it, if you forget, to make [things] conditional on it: mentioning it 
after forgetting [it] is the equal [in validity] to mentioning it at the time of the statement — as al-Hasan 
[al-Basrl] and others have said — as long as the person is ffill in the [same] place [in which he made the 
statement], And say, ‘May be my Lord will guide me to [something] closer [in time] than this, [closer] 
than the story of the People of the Cave, as an indication of [the truth of] my prophethood, by way of 
guidance, and God indeed did so.","And never say about anything, “I will surely do this tomorrow[15],” . without adding, “if Allah wills.” And remember your Lord if you forget, and say, “My Lord will hopefully guide me to something closer to what is right[16].”","[15] For you do not know whether you will be able to do it or you will be diverted from it. . [16] As soon as one remembers not saying inshā’ Allah concerning doing something in the future, he should say it. Also when one forgets something, he should mention Allah so as to remember things."
18,25,26,"Mid they tarried in the Cave three hundred (read [with tanwin ] thaldthami’atin ) years (sinin 
is an explicative supplement to thalathami’atin, ‘three hundred’): these three hundred years in the case 
of the People of the Cave were solar years; but for [the number of] lunar ones, the Arabs add nine years 

3 The expression lutf commonly denotes ‘gentleness’, hence the usual English translations of this verse as ‘let him be courteous’ (cf. 
Pickthall, Arberry); but lutf also has the meaning of ‘subtlety’, hence ‘careful’ which makes better sense since the idea was not to 
attrad: attention.

dred solar years, while three hundred and nine lunar ones. Say: ‘God is more knowledgeable of how long they tarried, [more knowledgeable] than those 
contending over this [issue] — and this [facft] has already been mentioned [above, verse 19]. To Him 
belongs the Unseen of the heavens and the earth, that is, [to Him belongs] the knowledge thereof. How 
well He sees!, namely, God — this form 5 is for [expressing] amazement [at something]. How well He 
hears!, likewise [for expressing amazement]. 6 These two [expressions] are being used metaphorically. 
What is meant is that nothing can escape God’s sight or hearing. They, the inhabitants of the heavens and 
the earth, have no guardian, someone to assist [them], besides Him, and He makes none to share in His 
rule’, for He is Independent, without need of a partner.","They remained in their cave for three hundred years, plus nine[17]. . Say, “Allah knows best how long they remained. To Him belongs [the knowledge of] the unseen of the heavens and earth. How well He sees and how well He hears[18]! They have no protector besides Him, and He shares His command with none.”","[17] i.e., 309 years. . [18] i.e., Nothing can escape Allah’s Sight and Hearing."
18,27,28,"And recite that which has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord. There is none who can 
change His words. And you will not find, besides Him, any refuge. And restrain yourself, detain [yourself], along with those who call upon their Lord at morning 
and evening, desiring, through their worship, His Countenance, exalted be He, and not any of the tran¬ 
sient things of this world — and these are the poor; and do not let your eyes overlook, turn away [from], 
them — these [the eyes] are being used to refer to the person [addressed] — desiring the glitter of the 
life of this world. And do not obey him whose heart We have made oblivious to Our remembrance, that 
is, [to] the Qur’an — this was ‘Uyayna b. Hisn and his companions — and who follows his own whim, 
by attributing partners [to God], and whose conduct is [mere] prodigality, excess.","Recite what has been revealed to you from the Book of your Lord. None can change His Words, and you will never find any refuge except with Him[19]. . Be patient with those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure. Do not turn your eyes away from them, desiring the adornments of the life of this world. And do not obey one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance, who follows his desires and whose affairs [deeds] are at loss.","[19] There is no escape from the punishment of Allah, should the Message not be conveyed, recited, and followed accordingly."
18,29,31,"And say, to him and to his companions that this Qur’an is, ‘The truth [that comes] from your 
Lord; so whoever will, let him believe, and whoever will, let him disbelieve’ — this is [meant as] a threat 
to them. Indeed We have prepared for the wrongdoers, that is, the disbelievers, a Fire, and they will be 
surrounded by its pavilion, [by] that which encloses [the Fire itself]. If they cry out for help, they will 
be succoured with water like molten copper, like thick [burning] oil, which scalds faces, because of [the 
intensity of] its heat, if it is brought near them. What an evil drink, that is, and how ill, is the Fire [as],

will reward them with what it [the reward of good-doers] comprises). Those, for them there shall be Gardens of Eden, as a [place of] residence, underneath which riv¬ 
ers flow; therein they shall be adorned with bracelets of gold ( min asawir : it is said that min here is either 
extra or partitive; it [asawir] is the plural of aswira — similar [in pattern] to ahmira [for himdr] — which

(iStabraq is that [silk] which is coarse: [God says] in the verse of [surat] al-Rahmdn [Q. 55:54], lined with 
[heavy] silk brocade); reclining therein on couches ( araik is the plural of arika, which is a bed inside a 
[curtained] canopy, and is also a tent adorned with garments and curtains for a bride). How excellent a 
reward, a requital, is Paradise, and how fair a reSling-place!","Say, “The truth is from your Lord. Whoever wills may believe, and whoever wills may disbelieve.” We have prepared for the wrongdoers a Fire which will encompass them like the walls.

Those who believe and do righteous deeds, We will not let the reward of those who do good deeds to go to waste. . It is they who will have Gardens of Eternity, under which rivers flow.

vines, and We had surrounded them with date-palms and had set between them [ afield of] crops, from 
which he acquired [his] food supplies. Each of the two gardens (kilta, ‘each [of the two]’ is a singular [noun] that indicates a dual 
[number]; and [the entire clause] is the subjedt) yielded ( atat is the predicate thereof) its produce, its 
fruit, without Stinting, diminishing, any thing thereof And We caused a Stream to gush forth therein, to 
run through them. And he had, together with his two gardens, fruit (read thamar, thumur, or thumr, [all of which 
constitute] the plural of thamra, [sing.] ‘a fruit’, similar [in pattern] to shajara [pi.] shajar, khashaba [pi] 
khushb, or badana [pi.] budn) and he said to his companion, the believer, as he conversed with him, 
boaSting before him: ‘I have more wealth than you and am Stronger in reSpeSl of men’, in reSJied of 
clansmen. And he entered his garden, [taking] with him his companion, accompanying him all around it, 
showing him its fruits — God does not say [here] his ‘two gardens’, because what is meant is the beauti¬ 
ful [part of the] garden ( rawda ); or because [to mention juSt] one suffices — having wronged himself, 
through [his] disbelief. He said, ‘I do not think that [all] this will ever perish, become non-exiStent. Moreover, I do not think that the Hour will ever come; and [even] if I am indeed returned to 
my Lord, in the Hereafter, according to your claim, I shall surely find better than this as a resort’, as a 
[place of] return. His companion said to him, as he conversed with him, responding to him: ‘Doyou disbelieve in

thing good in the way of family or wealth and upon receiving it says, “What God wills [comes to pass]; 
there is no power except in God” ( ma shaa’Llah la quwwata ilia bi’Llah), he will never experience any 
ill therefrom’. If you see me ( and is a pronoun separating two diredt objedts) as less than you in wealth 
and children, maybe my Lord will give me [something] better than your garden (this is the response to the 
conditional clause [beginning with lawla, ‘and if only’]) and unleash upon it bolts ( husban is the plural 
of husbana ), that is to say, thunderbolts, from the heaven so that it becomes a bare plain, a [piece of]

of a believer.","And [beware of] the Day when We will move the mountains away, and you will see the earth laid bare[26]; We will gather them all and not leave behind anyone of them. . They will be presented before your Lord in rows, “Now you have come to Us as We created you the first time[27], although you claimed that We would never appoint a time for your return.” . And the record [of deeds] will be placed before them, and you will see the wicked scared of what it contains. They will say, “Woe to us! What is this book that leaves nothing, small or big, except that it has recorded it?” They will find all what they did before them, and your Lord does not wrong anyone.","[26] i.e., flattened. . [27] Nude, uncircumcised, and lonely."
18,50,53,"And when ( idh is dependent because it is governed by [an implicit] udhkur, ‘mention [when]’) 
We said to the angels, ‘Prostrate before Adam’, a prostration involving a bow, not placing one’s forehead 
down [to the ground], as a greeting to him; and so they prostrated, [all] except Iblis. He was [one] of the 
jinn — some say that these [creatures] are a Species of angels, in which case the exceptive clause [ilia Iblis, 
except Iblis’] is a continuous one; but it is also said to be discontinuous, since Iblis is [considered] the 
progenitor of [all] the jinn, having offering who are mentioned alongside him further below; 11 angels, 
on the other hand, do not have offering; and he transgressed again St his Lord’s command, that is to say, 
he rebelled againSt obedience to Him by refraining from [performing] the prostration. Will you then 
take him and his offspring — this address is to Adam and his progeny (the [final pronominal suffix] ha 
in both words refers to Iblis )' 2 for your patrons instead of Me, obeying them, when they are an enemy to 
you?, in other words, [when they are your] enemies ( wa-hum lakum ‘aduwwun is a circumstantial quali¬ 
fier). How evil for the evildoers is that substitute!, of Iblis and his offspring, in obeying them instead of 
obeying God. / did not make them a witness, that is, Iblis and his offspring, to the creation of the heavens and 
the earth, nor to their own creation, that is to say, I did not make any of them present at the [moment of 
the] creation of the other. Nor do I take misleaders, devils, as [My] support, as assistants in [the process 
of] creation, so why do you obey them? And the day (yawma is in the accusative because it is governed by [the implicit] udhkur, ‘men¬ 
tion’) when He will say ( yaqul, or [it may be] read as naqiil, ‘We will say’), ‘Call those partners of Mine, 
[those] graven images, as you used to claim’, let them intercede for you in the way you used to claim; and 
then they will call them, but they will not respond to their call, they will not answer them, and We shall 
set between them, between the graven images and those who worship them, a gulf of doom — a valley 
from among the valleys of Hell, in which they shall all be destroyed (the term [ mawbiq ] derives from [the 
verb] wabaqa meaning halaka, ‘he was destroyed’). And the criminals will behold the Fire and realise that, are certain that, they are about to fall 
into it. And they will find no means of avoiding it, of circumventing [it].","And [remember] when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all prostrated except Iblīs, who was one of the jinn, but he disobeyed the command of his Lord. Will you then take him and his progeny as protectors instead of Me[28], even though they are your enemies[29]? What a terrible exchange for the wrongdoers! . I did not call them to witness the creation of the heavens and earth, nor even the creation of their own selves, and I would not take those who misguide others as helpers[30]. . And [beware of] the Day when He will say, “Call upon those whom you claimed to be My partners.” So they will call them, but they will not respond to them[31], and We will make them share the same doom. . The wicked will see the Fire and realize that they are bound to fall into it, and they will find no escape from it.","[28] Demons could possess their idols and communicate through them; they also used to seek refuge from the evil of the jinn by appraising them and slaughtering sacrifices for them.
 [29] Satan along with his fellow demons continues to lead people astray from the right Path. . [30] Allah, the source of guidance, would not take false deities who are the main cause of misguidance as helpers. . [31] The false deities they took besides Allah will let them down when they need them most on Judgment Day."
18,54,56,"And verily We have dispensed. We have explained, for mankind in this Qur’an [an example] of 
every kind of similitude ( min kulli mathalin is an adjecftive qualifying an omitted clause, in other words, 

‘ [We have dispensed therein] a similitude from every kind of similitude), that they may be admonished. 
But man is moSt disputatious, [he is] moSt contentious in matters of falsehood (jadalan is a Specification 
derived from [al-insan, ‘man’] the subjecft of kana ) in other words, the meaning is that the disputatious¬ 
ness of man is what can be found in him moSt. And nothing prevented people, that is, the disbelievers of Mecca, from believing (an yu’minu is 
[after al-nasa, ‘people’] constitutes the second direcft objecft clause) when the guidance, the Qur’an, came 
to them, and from asking forgiveness of their Lord, without that there should come upon them the prec¬ 
edent of the ancients (sunnatu’l-awwalin constitutes the subjecft of the verb) that is to say, Our precedent 
of dealing with them, which is the deStrudion decreed for them, or that the chastisement should come 
upon them before their very eyes, in front of them and for them to see — which was their being killed 
on the day of Badr (a variant reading [for qibalan ] has qubulan, which [in the accusative] is the plural of 
qabilin, meaning, ‘of various kinds’). 13 And We do not send messengers except as bearers of good tidings, to believers, and as warners, 
as threateners to disbelievers. But those who disbelieve dispute with falsehood, when they say that, ‘Has 
God sent a human as a messenger [from Him]?’ [Q. 17:94] and the like of such [Statements], that they 
may refute thereby, that by way of their disputing they may invalidate, the truth, the Qur’an. And they

13 Of course, it is qubulun in the nominative, plural of qabilun; the variant reading gives the alternative sense thus: ‘Or that there 
should come upon them various kinds of chastisement’.

have taken My signs, namely, the Qur’an, and that whereof they have been warned, in the way of the 
Fire, derisively, in mockery.","We have surely diversified in this Qur’an every kind of example for people[32], but man is the most quarrelsome of all beings[33]. . Nothing prevents people from believing when guidance comes to them and from seeking forgiveness from their Lord except that the fate of the earlier nations should come to them, or that the punishment should come before their eyes. . We do not send the messengers except as bearers of glad tidings and warners. But those who disbelieve seek to undermine the truth with false arguments, and they take My verses and warnings in ridicule.","[32] So that people may become mindful and be guided.
 [33] Humans always defend their position instead of yielding to the truth. It pertains to disbelievers more than anyone else."
18,57,59,"And who does greater wrong than he who has been reminded of the signs of his Lord, yet turns 
away from them and forgets what his hands have sent ahead?, what he has committed in the way of 
disbelief and acfts of disobedience. Indeed on their hearts We have caft veils, coverings, left they should 
understand it, that is, le\s‘t they should comprehend the Qur’an, in other words, and so [as a result] they 
do not comprehend it; and in their ears a deafness, a heaviness, and so they do not hear it; and though 
you call them to guidance, they will not be guided in that case, that is, given the casting [of veils] men¬ 
tioned, ever. And your Lord is the Forgiver, Full of Mercy. Were He to take them to task, in this world, for 
what they have earned, He woidd have hastened for them the chastisement, therein; but they have a 
try ft, which is the Day of Resurrection, from which they will not find any escape, any refuge. And those towns, that is to say, the inhabitants of those [towns], such as ‘Ad and Thamud, as well 
as others, We destroyed them when they did evil, [when] they disbelieved, and We appointed for their 
destruction (a variant reading [for mahlikihim] has muhlakihim) 1 * a try ft.","Who could be more wrong than one who is reminded of the verses of his Lord, but he turns away from them and forgets what his hands have sent forth? We have placed veils on their hearts so that they cannot understand it, and deafness in their ears. Even if you call them to guidance, they will never be guided. . But your Lord is the All-Forgiving, Lord of Mercy. If He were to take them to task for what they did, He would have hastened their punishment. Yet there is an appointed time for them from which they will find no escape. . Those are the towns We destroyed when they persisted in wrongdoing, and We set an appointed time for their destruction.",
18,60,77,"And, mention, when Moses, son of Amram (‘Imran), said to his lad, Joshua son of Nun ( Yusha 
bin Nun), who used to follow him around, serve him and acquire knowledge from him, ‘I will not give 
up, I will not ,<ftop journeying, until I have reached the juncture of the two seas — the point where the 
Byzantine sea and the Persian sea meet, beyond the cash, 15 — though I march on for ages’, for a very long 
time before reaching it, if it be far. So when they reached a juncture between the two, between the two seas, they forgot their fish 
— Joshua forgot his luggage [leaving it behind] at the moment of departure, and Moses forgot to remind 
him — and so it, the fish, made its way into the sea, that is, it formed it — through God’s forming it — 
by burrowing, that is, like [through] a burrow, which is a passage that is long and enclosed; this was [so] 
because God, exalted be He, held back the flow of the water [preventing it] from [engulfing] the fish and 
it [the water] withdrew from around it [the fish] and remained thus like a cleft without closing, and what 
was beneath it [the cleft] &ood £till. And when they had made the traverse, of that location, having journeyed until the morning of 
the following day, he, Moses, said to his lad, ‘Bring us our breakfast, (ghada ) that [meal] which is con¬ 
sumed at the beginning of the day. We have certainly encountered on this journey of ours much fatigue’, 
exhaustion, which took its effecft [on them] after the traverse. He said, ‘Do you see? — in other words, remember, when we sheltered at the rock, in that loca¬ 
tion, indeed I forgot the fish — and none but Satan made me forget (al-shaytan, ‘Satan, substitutes for 
the [suffixed pronoun] ha [of ansani-hu]) to mention it (an adhkurahu, an inclusive substitution, in 
other words [it should be understood as] ansani dhikrahu, ‘he [Satan] made me forget the mentioning 
of if) — and it, the fish, made its way into the sea in an amazing manner’ (‘ajaban constitutes the sec¬ 
ond direcft objecft), that is to say, Moses and his lad were amazed by it, because of what has already been 
explained concerning it. Said he, Moses, ‘That, namely, our losing the fish, is what we have been seeking!’, what we have 
been after, for it is a sign for us of the presence of the one whom we seek. So they turned back, retracing 
their footsteps, until they reached the rock. 

14 Cf. Ibn Mujahid ( Qiraat , 393). The variants, though identical in their English translation, emphasise different aSJieCts of‘the 
destruction’: mahlikihim emphasises the faCt that God will destroy them, while muhlakihim, merely points to the time of their 
demise without reference to the agency involved. 

15 Presumably, the Byzantine sea would denote the Mediterranean, while the Persian sea might have been the Red sea, if seen as 
an extension of the Persian Gulf coastline; all of which suggests that the area in question is juSt beyond the Sinai desert near the 
modern-day Suez Canal. To translate the term majma as ‘confluence’ suggests that the two waters actually join, something which is 
not implicit in the text, nor is it the case in geographical reality. Moreover, in the following verse it is said majma' baynihima which 
suggests a juncture that brings the two seas together such as a traCt of land.

Sura al-Kahf So [there] they found one of Our servants, namely, al-Khidr, to whom We had given mercy from 
Us — according to one opinion this [mercy] was prophethood; according to another it was authority, 
and this [latter] is the opinion of the majority of scholars — and We had taught him knowledge from Us 
(‘ilman is the second direct object), in other words, some knowledge of unseen things; al-Bukharl reports 
the [following] hadith: ‘Moses was delivering a sermon among the Children of Israel and was asked, 
“Who is the moSt knowledgeable of people?” to which he [Moses] said, “Myself”. God then reproached 
him for not having attributed [his] knowledge as [coming] from Him. God then revealed to him the fol¬ 
lowing: “Truly, there is a servant of Mine at the juncture of the two seas; he is more knowledgeable than 
you”. Moses then asked, “My Lord, how do I reach him?” He [God] said, ‘Take a fish with you and place 
it in a basket and [the place] where you lose the fish will be [the place] where he is.” He [Moses] took a 
fish and placed it in a basket and departed together with his lad Joshua son of Nun until they reached 
the rock. [There] they placed their heads back and fell asleep. The fish began to move about in the bas¬ 
ket, until it escaped from it and fell into the sea, and it made its way into the sea in an amazing manner. 
God then held back the flow of the water [preventing it] from [engulfing] the fish, forming a kind of 
arch over it. When he awoke, his companion [Joshua] forgot to inform him of [what had happened to] 
the fish, and so they journeyed on for the remainder of that day and night until on the morning [of the 
second day] Moses said to his lad, ‘ Bring us our breakfast’, to where he says, and it made its way into the 
sea in an amazing manner’. He [Bukhari] said, ‘For the fish, it [the way into the sea] was [by] ‘burrowing’ 
(saraban ), and for Moses and his lad it [this way] was ‘amazing’ (‘ ajaban ) ...’ [and so on] to the end [of 
Bukhari’s report]. Moses said to him, ‘May I follow you for the purpose that you teach me of what you have been 
taught [ in the way] of probity?’, namely, [something] of right conduct through which I might be rightly- 
guided (a variant reading [for rashadan] has rushdan, ‘probity’); he asked him this because to increase 
[one’s] knowledge is [something which is] always sought. Said he, ‘Truly you will not be able to bear with me. And how can you bear with that whereof you have never been informed?’: in the above-men¬ 
tioned hadith [of Bukhari] after this verse [there is the following statement]: ‘O Moses, I possess knowl¬ 
edge which God has taught me and which you do not have, and [equally] you possess knowledge which 
God has taught you and which I do not have’. (His saying khubran, ‘informed’, is a verbal noun meaning 
that which you have never encompassed, in other words, the truth of which you have never been in¬ 
formed of.) He said, ‘You will find me, God willing, patient, and I will not disobey, in other words, and [you 
will also find me] non-disobedient [towards], you in any matter’, with which you charge me. He [Moses] 
made this [Statement] conditional upon the Will [of God] because he was not confident of himself in 
what he had committed himself to. Indeed, this is the custom of prophets and saints, namely, that they 
do not put their truSt in themselves for a single moment. He said, ‘Ifyou follow me then do not question me (la tas’alni, a variant reading has la tas’alanni ) 
concerning anything, that you might find objectionable in what I do, according to your [limited] knowl¬ 
edge, and be patient, until I [myself] make mention of it to you’, in other words, [until] I mention it 
to you with [an explication of] the reason for it. Moses accepted his precondition bearing in mind the 
rested which a student should exercise in the presence of a teacher. So they setoff, making their way on foot along the coaSt of the sea, until, when they embarked on 
the ship, which was carrying them, he, al-Khidr, made a hole in it, by destroying a plank or two on the 
Starboard side with an axe after they had sailed into deep waters. Said he, Moses, to him, ‘Did you make 
a hole in it to drown its people? ( li-tughriqa ahlahd, ‘for you to drown its people’; a variant reading has 
li-yaghraqa ahluha, ‘so that its people might drown). You have certainly done a dreadful thing’, that is, 
a grave and reprehensible thing — it is reported that the water did not [actually] penetrate it. He said, ‘Did I not say [that] you would not be able to bear with me?’

[ 18:73] He said, ‘Do not take me to task on account of that which I forgot, that is, [on account of the facft 
that] I was not mindful of submitting to you [in the matter] and of refraining from showing disapproval 
of your actions, and do not exhaust me, [do not] charge me, in this affair of mine with difficulty’, [with] 
hardship during my companionship of you, in other words, treat me throughout it with forgiveness and 
indulgence.  So they set off, after leaving the ship, making their way on foot, until, when they met a boy, who 
had not yet reached puberty, 16 playing with [other] boys, among whom his face was the fairest — and he, 
al-Khidr, slew him, by slitting his throat with a knife while he lay down, or by tearing his head off with his 
hand, or by smashing his head against a wall, all of which are [different] opinions (the coordinating fa 
[oifa-qatalahu, and he slew him ] is used here because [it indicates that] the slaying took place after the 
encounter; the response to idha, ‘when is [the following statement, qala ...]) — he, Moses, said, to him: 
‘Have you slain an innocent soul, that is, a pure one that had not reached the age of [legal] responsibil¬ 
ity (a variant reading [for zakiya ] has zakiyya ), [one slain] not in retaliation for another soul?, in other 
words, one that has not slain any soul. Verily you have committed an dreadful thing’ (read nukran or 
nukuran ), that is to say, an abomination. He said, ‘Did I not say to you that you would never be able to bear with me?’ ( laka, ‘to you, has 
been added to that [same Statement] which was made before because this time there could not be any 
excuse [for Moses’s impatience]. And for this reason, he said, ‘If I ask you about anything after this, after this instance, then do 
not keep me in your company, do not allow me to follow you, for truly you [will] have found from me 
(read ladunni or laduni), on my part, [sufficient enough] excuse’, for you to part company with me. So they set off, until, when they came to the folk of a [ certain ] town, namely, Antioch ( Antakya ), 
they asked its folk for food, they asked them for food by way of hospitality, but they refused to extend 
them any hospitality. They then found in it a wall, one hundred cubits high, about to collapse, that is, 
it was close to falling down because of its tilt; so he, al-Khidr, Straightened it, with his [own] hands. He, 
Moses, said, to him, ‘Hadyou wished, you could have taken (a variant reading [for la-ttakhadhta ] has 
la-takhidhta) a wage for it’, some [sort of] payment, since they did not extend us any hospitality deSpite 
our need for food.","And [remember] when Moses said to his servant, “I will not give up until I reach the junction of the two seas, or I travel for ages.” . But when they reached the junction of the two seas, they forgot their fish, which made its way into the sea, slipping away. . When they traveled further, he said to his servant, “Bring us our morning meal; this journey has truly exhausted us.” . He said, “You remember when we rested by the rock, I forgot the fish; it was none who made me forget to mention it except Satan, and it made its way into the sea amazingly.” . Moses said, “That is exactly what we were looking for.” So they turned back, retracing their footsteps. . There they found one of Our slaves[34] upon whom We bestowed Our mercy[35] and We taught him from Our Own knowledge[36]. . Moses said to him, “May I follow you so that you may teach me some knowledge that you have been taught?” . He said, “You will never be able to have patience with me.” . How can you have patience with that which you have no knowledge about?” . Moses said, “You will find me patient, if Allah wills; and I will not disobey any of your orders.” . He said, “Then if you follow me, do not ask me about anything until I mention it to you.” . So they both set out, until when they boarded a ship, he made a hole in it. Moses said, “Did you make a hole in it to drown its people? You have done something terrible!” . He said, “Did I not tell you that you will never be able to have patience with me?” . Moses said, “Do not take me to task for what I forgot, and do not make it too difficult for me to follow you.” . Then they proceeded until they met a boy, and the man killed him. Moses said, “Did you kill an innocent soul who killed none? You have done something monstrous!” . The man said, “Did I not tell you that you will never be able to have patience with me?” . Moses said, “If I ask you about anything after this, do not keep me in your company, for then you would be excused concerning me.” . Then they went on until they came to the people of a town[37]. They asked its people for food, but they refused to offer them hospitality. They found there a wall that was about to collapse, but he repaired it. Moses said, “If you wished, you could have taken some payment for it.”","[34] i.e., Al-Khidr.
 [35] i.e., Prophethood or being a righteous servant of Allah.
 [36] i.e., the knowledge that Allah gave him such as knowledge of some unseen events, of which others were unaware. . [37] Who were extremely mean folk."
18,78,82,"Said he, al-Khidr, to him, ""litis is the parting, that is, the moment for parting, between me and 
you (bayni wa-baynika, here [the preposition] bayna has been annexed to a non-multiple [noun], but 
this is allowed [grammatically] because it is then repeated with [its other noun together with] the coor¬ 
dinating wdw ).' 7 1 will inform you, before I part company with you, the interpretation of that over which 
you were not able to maintain patience. As for the ship, it belonged to poor people, ten [in number], who earned a living on the sea, with 
it, leasing it [to others], as a way of gaining [a living]; and I wanted to make it defective, for behind them, 
whenever they returned — or [meaning] before them now — was a king, a disbeliever, seizing every 
ship, that was usable, by force ( ghasban, is in the accusative as a verbal noun containing an explanation 
of the nature of such ‘seizure’). And as for the boy, his parents were believers and We feared leSl he should overwhelm them 
with insolence and disbelief — for he is as [described] by the hadith of Muslim, ‘He was [incorrigibly] 
disposed to disbelief, and had he lived [longer] this [disposition of his] would have oppressed them, be¬ 
cause of their love for him, they would have followed him in such [a path of disbelief]’. 

16 Literally, hinth is ‘sin’, in other words the age at which a persons deeds begin to be recorded, generally regarded as being upon 
his reaching puberty ( hilm). 

17 In other words, baynana , ‘between us’ would have been the usual expression, since bayna, ‘between, naturally requires two 
objedts for it to make sense. Hie author justifies the grammatical soundness of the preposition bayna being repeated and attached 
to a singular noun in both cases. This is peculiar to suffixed personal pronouns, as one would not need to repeat the preposition in 
the case of two proper nouns, for example bayna’I-shajarati wa’l-haif, ‘between the tree and the wall’.

Sura al-Kahf So We desired that their Lord should give them in exchange (read yubaddilahuma or 
yubdilahuma) one better than him in purity, that is, in righteousness and God-fearing, and closer, than 
him, to mercy (read ruhman or ruhuman, in other words [it is to be understood as] rahmatan, ‘by way 
of mercy’) namely, [closer to] dutifulness towards his parents. Thus God, exalted be He, gave them in 
exchange a girl, who [afterwards] married a prophet and gave birth to a prophet through whom God 
guided an entire community. And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys [who lived] in the city, and beneath it there 
was a treasure, a buried trove of gold and silver, belonging to them. Their father had been a righteous 
man, and so because of his righteousness they were protected both in [terms of] their souls and their 
possessions, and your Lord desired that they should come of age, that is, [He desired for them] the at¬ 
tainment of maturity, and extract their treasure as a mercy from your Lord (rahmatan min rabbik is a 
direct objeCt denoting reason, operated by [the verb] arada, ‘He desired’). And I did not do it, namely, 
what has been mentioned of [his] making a hole in the ship, the slaying of the boy and the repair of the 
wall, of my own accord, that is, [out of] my own choosing; nay, it was because of a command in the form 
of an inspiration from God. This is the interpretation of that over which you could not maintain pa¬ 
tience’ (one may say istaa or iSlataa to mean ‘he had the capacity for [something]’; in this instance and 
the previous one both forms [of the verb] have been used. Moreover, there is a variety of expression in 
the use of fa-aradtu, ‘I desired’, fa-aradna, ‘We desired’, and fa-arada rabbuk, ‘Your Lord desired’).","The man said, “This is the parting of ways between me and you. I will inform you of the interpretation of that which you could not bear with patience. . “As for the ship, it belonged to some poor people who worked at sea. I wanted to make it defective because there was a king ahead of them who seized every [good] ship by force. . “As for the boy, his parents were believers, and we feared that he would overburden them with his rebellion and disbelief[38]. . So we hoped that their Lord would give them another in his place, more righteous and tender-hearted. . As for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and there was a treasure under it that belonged to them. Their father was a righteous man, so your Lord willed that they should reach their maturity and retrieve their treasure[39], as a mercy from your Lord; I did not do it of my own accord. This is the interpretation of that which you could not bear with patience.”","[38] Even though the parents were believers, the son was to become a disbeliever, and it was feared that he would make them fall into disbelief out of their love for him. . [39] Had they not mended the wall, it would have subsequently fallen; they, being young, weak, and surrounded by mean people, would certainly have lost their treasure."
18,83,89,"And they, the Jews, question you concerning Dhu’l-Qarnayn, whose name was Alexander; he 
was not a prophet. Say: ‘I shall recite, relate, to you a mention, an account, of him’, of his affair. Indeed We empowered him throughout the land, by facilitating [for him] the journeying therein, 
and We gave him to everything, of which one might have need, a way, a route to lead him to that which 
he sought. And he followed a way, he took a route towards the weSt, until, when he reached the setting of the sun, the place where it sets, he found it setting in a 
muddy spring (‘ayn hami’a: [a Spring] containing ham’a, which is black clay): its setting in a Spring is 
[described as seen] from the perspective of the eye, for otherwise it is far larger [in size] than this world; 
and he found by it, that is, [by] the Spring, a folk, of disbelievers. We said, ‘O DhuT-Qarnayn — by 
[means of] inspiration — either chastise, the folk, by slaying [them], or treat them kindly’, by [merely] 
taking them captive. He said, As for him who does wrong, by way of [practising] idolatry, we shall chastise him. We 
shall slay him. Then he shall be returned to his Lord and He shall chaStise him with an awful chastise¬ 
ment (read nukran or nukuran ), that is, a severe [one], in the Fire. But as for him who believes and aids righteously, he shall have the faireSt reward, namely, Para¬ 
dise (the annexation construction [jazd’u l-husnd, ‘the faireSt reward’] is explicative; a variant reading 
has jazaan al-husnd, ‘[he shall have] as a requital that which is faireSt’; al-Farra’ said that this accusative 
[reading of jaza an] is [intended] as an explanation [of the nature of the requital] by way of attribution 
[to ‘that which is faireSt’]; and we shall Speak to him mildly in our command’, that is to say, we shall 
command him with what he will find easy [to bear]. Then he followed a way, towards the eaSt,","They ask you about Dhul-Qarnayn[40]. Say, “I will tell you something about him.” . We established him on earth and gave him the means to achieve everything[41]. . He pursued a course[42], . until when he reached the far west, he found the sun setting in a dark body of water, and he found some people nearby. We said, “O Dhul-Qarnayn, either punish them or treat them with kindness.” . He said, “As for one who does wrong[43], we will punish him, then he will be brought back to his Lord, and He will punish him grievously. . But he who believes and does righteous deeds, he will have the best reward[44], and we will enjoin upon him to do what is easy.” . Then he pursued another course,","[40] The Two-Horned Sovereign, about whom the Quraysh pagans asked the Prophet (ﷺ), along with that of the Companions of the Cave, testing his prophethood. He was named thus because he reached the rising point and the setting point of the sun; or two generations (qarns) of people passed away during his reign; or he had two long locks of hair; or his crown had two horns. . [41] Such as soldiers, weaponry, etc. . [42] Utilizing these means. . [43] By persisting in disbelief and associating partners with Allah. . [44] i.e., Paradise."

namely, Negroes ( zanj),for whom We had not provided againSt it, that is, [againSt] the sun, any [form

Tafsir al-Jalalayn 

pertained to him, that is, what Dhu’l-Qarnayn possessed in the way of machinery, men and otherwise, 
in knowledge. Then he followed a way, until, when he reached between the two barriers (read al-saddayn or al-suddayn here and [like¬ 
wise] further below [at verse 94, saddan or suddan ]) — [these were] two mountains [lying] in the remote 
regions beyond the land of the Turks; Alexander sealed the breach between the two, as will be described 
[below] — he found on this side of them, that is, in front of them, a folk that cotdd scarcely compre¬ 
hend speech, in other words, they could only understand it after much agonising (a variant reading [for 
yafqahuna, ‘comprehend’] has yufqihuna, ‘be understood’). 18 They said, ‘O Dhu’l-Qarnayn, truly Gog and Magog (read Ya’juj wa-Ma’juj or Yajuj wa-Mdjiij: 
these two are non-Arabic names of two tribes and are therefore indeclinable) are causing corruption in 
the land, plundering and oppressing [us] when they come forth to attack us. So shall we pay you a trib¬ 
ute, some [form of] payment (a variant reading [for kharjan ] is kharajan ), on condition that you build 
between us and them a barrier?, an obstruction, so that they will not be able to reach us. He said, ‘That, wealth and so on, wherewith my Lord has empowered me ( makkanni, a variant 
reading has makkanam) is better, than the tribute that you offer me, and so I have no need for it. I shall 
build for you the barrier without [demanding] a fee; so help me with strength, in that which I [will] de¬ 
mand from you, and I will build between you and them a rampart, a fortified barricade. Bring me ingots of iron!’, namely, pieces thereof, as large as the [blocks of] Stone to be used in 
the construction; he used these [ingots] in his construction, placing between them firewood and coal. 
Until, when he had levelled up [the gap] between the two flanks (read al-sudufayn, or al-sadafayn or 
al-sudfayn, meaning, the two flanks of the two mountains) he set up bellows and [lit a] fire around this 
[construction] — he said, ‘Blow!’, and they blew, until, when he had made it, namely, the iron, afire, 
that is, like a fire, he said, ‘Bring me molten copper to pour over it’ (the two verbs [atuni, ‘bring me’, and 
ufrigh, ‘pour’] are in contention over this [direct object, qitran, ‘molten copper’]; it [this direct object] has 
been omitted before the firSt [verb] because it is being governed by the second [verb]). Thus he poured 
the molten copper over the hot iron so that it penetrated between the [individual] ingots, making a 
[solid] single whole. And so they, Gog and Magog, were not able to scale it, to climb up its length, because of its 
[great] height and smoothness, nor could they pierce it, because of its firmness and thickness. Said he, Dhu’l-Qarnayn, ‘This, namely, the barrier, the ability to make it, is a mercy from my 
Lord, a grace [from Him], because it prevents them from coming forth. But when the promise of my 
Lord comes to pass, [the promise] of their coming forth, which will be near [the time of] the Resurrec¬ 
tion, He will level it, pulverised and flattened, for my Lord’s promise, of their coming forth and [of] 
other things, is [always] true’, it will be. God, exalted be He says:","until when he reached the far east, he found the sun rising on a people for whom We provided no shelter from it[45]. . So it was, and We had full knowledge about him[46]. . Then he pursued another course, . until when he reached [a valley] between the two mountains, he found beyond them a people who could barely understand a word[47]. . They said, “O Dhul-Qarnayn, Gog and Magog are spreading corruption in the land. Can we give you some payment in return for you to construct a barrier between us and them?” . He said, “What my Lord has given me is better. But help me with manpower, I will construct a barricade between you and them. . Bring me iron blocks” – until when he leveled between the two mountainsides, he said, “Blow [with bellows],” until when he fired them up to extreme heat, he said, “Bring me molten copper to pour over it.” . Thus they could not climb over it nor could they pierce it[48]. . He said, “This is a mercy from my Lord. But when the promise of my Lord comes to pass[49], He will raze it to the ground. The promise of my Lord is ever true.”","[45] They had nothing to shade them from the sun; trees, mountains, or buildings. . [46] i.e., Dhul-Qarnayn. . [47] They could not speak except their own language. . [48] They could not climb the dam for its smooth surface as well as it was as high as the mountains, and could not pierce it for its fortitude. . [49] Before the Day of Judgment."
18,99,106,"And on that day, the day of their coming forth, We shall let some of them surge againft others, 
mixing with one another, on account of their multitude, and the Trumpet, namely, the Horn signalling 
the Resurrection, shall be blown and We shall gather them, namely, creatures, in one place, on the Day 
of Resurrection, a [single] gathering. 

[ 18:100] And on that day We shall present. We shall bring close. Hell to the disbelievers, plain to view,  those [disbelievers] whose eyes (alladhina kanat ayunuhum substitutes for al-kafirina, ‘the dis¬ 
believers’) were masked from My remembrance, namely, the Qur’an, such that they were blind, unable 
to be guided thereby, and who could not [bear to] hear, that is to say, they were unable to listen to what 
the Prophet used to recite to them, out of SJiite for him, and so they did not believe therein. 

18 In other words, their Speech could scarcely be understood.

Sura al-Kahf 

[ 18:102] Do the disbelievers reckon that they can take My servants, namely, My angels, [as well as] Jesus 
and Ezra, as patrons, as lords, beside Me? ( awliyaa, ‘as patrons’, constitutes the second [direcft] objed 
of [the verb] yattakhidhu, ‘that they can take’; the second direcft objecft of [the verb] hasiba, ‘reckon, has 
been omitted). The meaning is: do they suppose that the mentioned ‘taking [as patrons]’ will not incur 
My wrath and that I will not punish them for this? No! Truly We have prepared Hell for the disbeliev¬ 
ers, these [the ones mentioned above] and others, as [a place of] hospitality, in other words, it has been 
prepared for them jud as a house is prepared for a gueSt.  Say: ‘Shall We inform you who will be the greatest losers in [regard to] their works? ( al- 
akhsarina a’malan, a Specification that happens to correspond to that which is Specifically meant); 19 and 
these [losers] are described in His words [as being]: Those whose effort goes aStray in the life of this world, [those] whose deeds are invalid, while 
they reckon, they think, that they are doing good work, [good] deeds for which they will be rewarded. Those are they who disbelieve in the signs of their Lord, in the proofs of His Oneness, [proofs] 
such as the Qur’an and otherwise, and the encounter with Him’, that is, and [who disbelieve] in resurrec¬ 
tion, reckoning, reward and punishment. So their works have failed, they are invalid, and on the Day of 
Resurrection We shall not assign any weight to them, in other words, We shall not accord them any value. That, namely, the matter which I [God] have mentioned concerning the failure of their deeds 
and so on ( dhalika, ‘that’, constitutes the subjed) is their requital — Hell — because they disbelieved 
and took My signs and My messengers in mockery, that is to say, [taking] both of them as something to 
be derided.","On that Day[50] We will let some of them surge like waves over others, and the Trumpet will be blown, then We will gather them all together. . On that Day We will show Hell to the disbelievers clearly[51], . those whose eyes were blind to My signs[52] and they were unable to hear [the truth][53]. . Do the disbelievers think that they can take My slaves as allies instead of Me? We have prepared Hell as a dwelling place for the disbelievers. . Say, “Shall we inform you of the greatest losers in terms of their deeds? . Those whose efforts in the life of this world are wasted, while they think that they are doing well[54].” . It is those who disbelieve in the verses of their Lord and their meeting with Him; their deeds will be nullified, and We will give no weight to them on the Day of Resurrection[55]. . That is their recompense: Hell, because of their disbelief and taking My verses and messengers in ridicule.","[50] When the dam is destroyed. . [51] Before they enter it on the Day of Judgment. . [52] Or of the Qur’an. [53] To believe in it. . [54] For they follow other than their Lord’s path, and justify their deviant actions until they finally believe that they are on the right path. . [55] It shows the ghastly fate of the disbelievers."
18,107,108,"Truly those who believe and perform righteous deeds — theirs will be, according to God’s 
prescience, the gardens ofFirdaws, which are at the centre of Paradise 20 and [at] its highest part (the an¬ 
nexation thereto [of firdaws to jannat, gardens’] is explicative) as [a place of] hospitality, as an abode; wherein they will abide, with no desire, demand, to be removed from them, to be transferred 
to some other [gardens].","As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, they will have gardens of Paradise[56] as a dwelling place[57], . abiding therein forever, never desiring to leave.","[56] i.e., al-Firdaus: the highest level of Paradise.
 [57] It shows the regal fate of the believers."
18,109,110,"Say: ‘If the sea, in other words, [if] its waters, were ink ( midad is what one writes with) for the 
Words of my Lord, [Words] that testify to His laws and His marvels, such that these [Words] are written 
with it, the sea would be Spent, in recording them, before the Words of my Lord were Spent (read as tan- 
fada or yanfada) even though We brought the like of it, namely, [the like of] the sea, as replenishment’, 
in order to add it to the other [sea], it would [also] be ^penfi while they [God’s Words] would not be 
exhausted ( madadan, ‘as replenishment’, in the accusative because it is a specification). Say: ‘I am only a human being, a son of Adam, like you; it has been revealed to me that your 
God is only One God ( annama, the anna assimilated with the ma retains [its funcftion of referring to] the 
verbal noun), in other words, the Oneness of the Divine is [what is being] revealed to me. So whoever 
hopes to encounter his Lord, through the Resurrection and the Requital, let him do righteous work and 
not associate with the worship of his Lord, that is to say, [let him not commit idolatry] in [performing] 
it by feigning [faith] before, anyone’. 


19 In other words, they are losers in terms of their works and at the same time they are losers because of their works. In order to 
clarify this, the reader might consider if the Verification had been another word such as ‘ aqibatan : ‘(the greatest losers) in terms 
of consequence’. 

20 Although ‘paradise’ is the same word as firdaws, the latter has been transliterated to allow for the subtle di^findiion in the text.

Zachariah (an explication of it [the direcft objecft]), when (idh is semantically connected to rahma, ‘mercy’) he called out to his Lord a call, entailing a 
supplication, in secret, in the middle of the night, because this [time of the night] invites a fader reponse 
[to one’s supplication]. He said, My Lord, truly the bones, all [the bones], within me have become feeble, weak, and 
my head is alight with grey hair ( shayban, a .specification derived from the subjed of the verb in other 
words, hoariness has pread throughout his hairs jud as a park of fire preads through firewood) 2 and I 
wish to supplicate to you, and I have never been in my supplications to You, my Lord, unsuccessful, that 
is, [I have never been] disappointed, in the pad, so do not disappoint me in what follows. And truly I fear my kinsfolk, namely, those who will succeed me [as closed after me] in kinship, 
such as [my] paternal cousins, after me, that is, after my death, [I fear] for the religion, led they forsake it, 
as You have witnessed in the case of the Children of Israel, in the way that they changed [their] religion, 
and my wife is barren, she does not conceive. So grant me from Yourself a successor, a son, who may inherit from me (read yarithni in apocopated form as a reponse to the imperative date- 
ment [fa-hab li, ‘grant me’], or read yarithuni as an adjecftival qualification of waliyyan, ‘a successor’) and 
inherit (also read in both ways [mentioned]), 3 /rom the House of Jacob, my forefather, [inherit] knowl¬ 
edge and prophethood, and make him, my Lord, acceptable’, that is, pleasing to you. God, exaltedbe He, in reponding to his requed for a son that will be the incarnation of His mercy, 
says: ‘O Zachariah! Indeed We give you good tidings of a boy, who will inherit in the way that you have 
requeded — whose name is John. Never before have We made anyone his namesake’, that is, [never has 
there been] anyone with the name ‘John’. He said, ‘My Lord, how shall I have a son when my wife is barren and I have reached infirm 
old age?’ (‘ itiyyan, [derives] from [the verb] ‘ata, ‘it became withered’) in other words, [he had reached] 
extreme old age, 120 years; and his wife had reached the age of 98 (‘atiya in terms of its root derives from 
‘utuwwun, but the ta is vowelled as -ti-, to soften it, the fird wdw [vowel] is changed into a yd’ to be in 
harmony with the -ti- vowelling, while the second [wdw letter] is changed into a yd’ so that the [previ¬ 
ous] yd’ can be assimilated with it). He said, ‘It, the matter [in quedion], of creating a boy from both of you, shall be so! Your Lord 
says, “It is easy for Me, namely, to redore your sexual potency and tear open your wife’s womb [in prepa¬ 
ration] for conception,/or I certainly created you before when you were nothing’”, [you were nothing] 
before your created form became manifed. As God wished to manifed this great power. He inpired him 
[the form of] the quedion, in order for him to receive the reponse that will indicate it [this power]. And 
when his soul yearned for the prompt arrival of that whereof he had been given good tidings: 

1 In other words, rahma here functions as a verbal noun, so that the import is: ‘a mention of your Lord’s being merciful to His 
servant, Zachariah’. 

2 The allusion to the way in which fire breads is because the Arabic verb used metaphorically for the ^reading of the grey hairs 
is ishta’ala, ‘to be ablaze’.

Sura Maryam He said, ‘Lord, appoint for me some sign’, namely, some indication of my wife’s becoming preg¬ 
nant. Said He, ‘Your sign, for this, is that you shall not tpeak to people, that is, that you [should] refrain 
from peaking to them, but not [from peaking] the remembrance of God, exalted be He, for three 
nights, that is, together with the days thereof, as [Stated] in [surat] Al ‘Imran, for three days’ [Q. 3:41], 
while [you are] in sound health’ (sawiyyan, a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb 
tukallima, ‘you shall [not] SJieak’) in other words, deSJiite there being no defecft [in you]. So he emerged before his people from the sanduary, that is, from the temple — they had been 
waiting for him to open it in order to perform [their] prayers therein after his command, as was the 
cuStom — and signalled, indicated, to them, ‘Make glorifications, perform prayers, at morning and 
evening’, at the beginning of the day and [at] its end, as per usual. He then realised, upon his being pre¬ 
vented from Sneaking to them, that she was pregnant with John.","Kāf Ha Ya ‘Ayyn Sād[1] . This is a reminder of the mercy of your Lord to His slave Zachariah, . When he called upon his Lord in private. . He said, “My Lord, my bones have grown feeble, and gray hair has spread across my head,[2] yet never have I been disappointed in my prayer to You, my Lord. . And I fear my kinsmen after me,[3] and my wife is barren; so grant me from Yourself an heir, . who will inherit [prophethood] from me and from the house of Jacob, and make him, O Lord, well pleasing to You.” . [Allah said], “O Zachariah, We give you the glad tidings of a son, whose name will be John – a name that We have not given to anyone before.” . He said, “My Lord, how can I have a son when my wife is barren, and I have reached an extremely old age?” . [The angel] said, “Thus it will be; your Lord says, ‘It is easy for Me; I did create you before when you were nothing.’” . Zachariah said, “My Lord, give me a sign.” He said, “Your sign is that you will not be able to speak to people for three nights,[4] despite being sound.” . Thereupon he came out to his people from the sanctuary and signaled to them to glorify Allah morning and evening.","[1] See footnote 2:1 . [2] Lit., ""ignited."" The spread of white hair across the head is likened to igniting of fire in the bush. . [3] i.e., my successors. . [4] i.e., without being ill."
19,12,15,"And two years after his birth, God, exalted be He, said to him: ‘O John! Hold on to the Scripture, 
namely, the Torah, firmly’, earnestly. And We gave him judgement, prophethood, while dill a child, a 
three-year old; and compassion, a mercy for mankind, from Us, from Our presence, and purity, a charity for 
them, and he was God-fearing — it is related that he never committed a sin, nor contemplated [com¬ 
mitting] one; and dutiful to his parents, that is, virtuous towards them. And he was not arrogant or rebellious, 
disobedient to his Lord. ‘Andpeace, from Us, be upon him, the day he was born, and the day he dies, and the day he 
shall be raised alive!’, that is, [on] those fearful days in which he sees what he will never have seen before 
— in these he will be given security [from fear].","[Allah said], “O John, hold the Scripture with all your strength.” And We gave him wisdom when he was still a child, . as We made him compassionate and righteous, and he was fearing Allah, . and dutiful to his parents, and he was not an oppressor or disobedient. . Peace be on him the day he was born, the day he will die, and the day he will be raised up to life again!",
19,16,33,"And mention in the Book, [in] the Qur’an, Mary, that is, [mention] her tale, when she withdrew 
from her family to an eaderly place, that is, [when] she secluded herself in a place on the eaSt side of 
[her] home. Thus she veiled herself from them, she draped herself in a veil to conceal herself while she washed 
her hair [from lice], or [washed] her clothes, or cleansed herself from her menses; whereupon We sent to 
her Our Spirit, Gabriel, and he assumed before her, after she donned her clothes, the likeness of a well- 
proportioned human, perfecft in physical form. She said, ‘Lo! I seek refuge in the Compassionate One from you! If you fear God’, and leave me 
alone on account of my invocation of refuge in God. He said, ‘lam only a messenger of your Lord, that I may give you a boy [who shall be] pure’, in 
[his] prophethood. She said, ‘How shall I have a boy when no human being has [ever] touched me, byway of con¬ 
jugality, neither have I been unchaste?’, [neither have I been] a fornicator. He said, ‘It, the matter in question, of creating a boy from you without a father, shall be so! Your 
Lord has said: “It is easy for Me, in other words, by Gabriel’s breathing into you, by My command, so 
that you become pregnant with him — since what has been mentioned is meant as a reason, the follow¬ 
ing [Statement] is added as a supplement thereto: and so that We may make him a sign for mankind, 
of Our power, and a mercy from Us, to whoever believes in him. And it, the creation of him, is a thing 
[already] decreed’”, according to My knowledge. So Gabriel breathed into the opening of her shirt, 
whereupon she sensed the formed foetus in her womb. Thus she conceived him and then withdrew, retreated, with him to a distant place, far from her family. And the birth pangs, the pains of childbirth, brought her to the trunk of the palm-tree, that she

may support herself against it, and then she gave birth: the conception, formation [of the foetus] and de¬ 
livery [all] took place within one hour. She said, ‘O (yd is [used] to call attention [to something]) would 
that I had died before this, affair, and become a forgotten thing, beyond recall!’, a thing abandoned 
which no one knows or mentions. Then he called her from below her, namely, Gabriel — for he was lower than her, ‘Do not grieve. 
Your Lord has made below you a rivulet, a river of water, which had dried up. And shake the trunk of the palm-tree towards you, [a palm-tree] which had withered (the bi-

coming together) any human being, and should he ask you about your child, then say, “I have vowed to 
the Compassionate One a fail, that is to say, an abstention from Sneaking of his affair and from [Sneak¬ 
ing to] any other humans — which is indicated by [the following Statement]), so I will notipeak to any 
human today’”, that is, after [saying] this. Then, carrying him, she brought him to her folk ( tahmiluhu, ‘carrying him’, a circumstantial 
qualifier), and they saw him, and they said, ‘O Mary, truly you have done a curious thing!, an astound¬ 
ing [thing], for you have begotten a son without [his having] a father. O sifter of Aaron — he was a righteous man, in other words [what is meant is], O you who are 
like him in [terms of] chaStity — your father was not a wicked man, that is, a fornicator, nor was your 
mother unchafte’, that is, a fornicatress: so how is it that you have this child? Thereat she pointed, them, to him, intimating [to them that they], ‘talk to him’. They said, ‘How 
can we talk to one who is, who happens to be, in the cradle, [ftill] a little child?’ He said, ‘Lo! I am God’s servant. He has given me the Scripture, namely, the GoSjiel, and made 
me a prophet. And He has made me blessed wherever I may be, that is, [He has made me] of great benefit to 
mankind — [this is] a foretelling of what had been preordained for him — and He has enjoined upon me 
prayer and alms-giving. He has commanded me to [do] both of these, as long as I remain alive; and [He has made me] dutiful towards my mother (barran, in the accusative because of the 
implicit [verb] ja’alani, ‘He has made me’). And He has not made me arrogant, haughty, wretched, 
disobedient to his Lord. And peace, from God, be upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall 
be raised alive!’ — the same is being said about him as [was said above] regarding the lord John. God, 
exalted be He, says:","And mention in the Book [the story of] Mary when she withdrew from her family to a place towards the east. . She screened herself from them, then We sent to her Our Spirit [Gabriel] and he appeared before her in the form of a perfect human being. . She said, “I seek refuge in the Most Compassionate from you; [do not approach me] if you fear Allah.” . He said, “I am only a messenger from your Lord to grant you a righteous son.” . She said, “How can I have a son when no man has touched me, nor have I ever been unchaste?” . He said, “Thus it will be; your Lord says, ‘It is easy for Me; We make him a sign for people and a mercy from Us. This matter has already been decreed.’” . So she conceived him and withdrew with him to a distant place.[5] . The pains of labor drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She said, “Oh, would that I had died before this and had been completely forgotten!” . Then he[6] called her from beneath her, “Do not grieve; your Lord has provided a stream beneath you. . Shake the trunk of the palm tree towards yourself; fresh ripe dates will drop upon you. . Eat and drink, and be glad. And if you see any human being, say, ‘I have vowed silence[7] to the Most Compassionate, so I will not talk to any human being today.’” . Then she came to her people carrying him. They said, “O Mary, you have committed something monstrous! . O sister of Aaron,[8] your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste.” . Thereupon she pointed to him. They said, “How can we talk to someone who is still a baby in the cradle?” . Jesus said, “I am a slave of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet. . He has made me blessed wherever I may be, and has enjoined upon me prayer and zakah as long as I am alive, . and has made me dutiful to my mother, and has not made me an oppressor or disobedient. .

plied subject, in other words, ‘the statement of the son of Mary [is a statement of truth]’; or read qawla’l- 
haqqi, because of [it being the objeCt of] an implied [verb] qultu, ‘I say’, meaning, ‘[I say] a statement of 
truth’) concerning which they are in doubt ( yamtaruna , derives from [the infinitive] al-mirya ) — they 
are the Christians, who say, ‘Indeed Jesus is the son of God’; [but] they lie. It is not [befitting] for God to take to Himself a son. Glory be to Him — in affirmation of His 
being transcendent above [doing] such a thing. When He decrees a thing, that is, [when] He will for it 
to happen, He only says to it, ‘Be!’, and it is (read fa-yakunu because of an implied [pronoun] huwa [sc. 
fa-huwa yakunu ]; or read fa-yakuna because of an implied an [sc. an yakuna ]). An example of this is His 
creating Jesus without [his having had] a father. And indeed God is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him (read [the introductory particle] 
as anna, with an implicit [preceding] udhkur, ‘mention’; or read [it] as inna, with an implicit [preceding] 
qul, ‘say’, 5 [a reading] indicated by [the facft that God says elsewhere] ‘I only said to them that which You 
commandedme: “Worship God, my Lord and your Lord” ’ [Q. 5:117]). This, that has been mentioned, is a 
Straight path, a route leading to Paradise. But the factions differed among themselves, that is to say, the Christians, [they differed] regard¬ 
ing Jesus: was he the son of God? A god alongside Him? Or [was he] the third of three [gods]? So woe 
— [meaning] severe punishment [will be meted out] — to those who disbelieve, [those who disbelieve] 
in the way mentioned and in other ways, at the scene of an awful Day, that is to say, [woe to them] when 
they are present at the Day of Resurrection and [witnessing] its terrors. How hearing they are and seeing, they are (these two constructions [are used to] express ‘amaze¬ 
ment’, meaning, ‘how well they [will] hear and how well they [will] see’) on the Day when they come to 
Us, in the Hereafter. Yet the evildoers (an example of a proper noun [evildoers’] replacing a third person 
pronominalisation) 6 today, that is, in this world, are in manifest error, that is, [error] that is evident 
therein, having been deaf [unable] to listen to the truth and blind [unable] to see it. In other words, [the 
meaning is]: O you, the one being addressed, marvel at how [well] they will [be able to] hear and see in 
the Hereafter after they had been deaf and blind in this world. And warn them, threaten, O Muhammad (s), the disbelievers of Mecca, of the Day of Regret, 
namely, the Day of Resurrection, on which the sinner will regret not having been virtuous in [the life of] 
this world, when the matter will be decided, for them thereupon, that they be chastised, while they, in 
this world, are [yet] heedless, of it, and do not believe, in it [the Day of Resurrection]. Indeed We (inna nahnu, [a repetition of the firSt person] for emphasis), shall inherit the earth 
and all who are on it, of rational beings and others, by destroying them, and to Us they shall be returned, 
thereon [on the Day of Resurrection] for requital.","Such was Jesus, son of Mary – a word of truth about which they are in doubt. . It is not befitting for Allah to beget a son. Glory be to Him[9]! When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, “Be,” and it is. . [Jesus said], “Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is a straight path.” . But the factions differed among themselves[10] [about him]. So woe to the disbelievers from the scene of a momentous Day! . How sharp they will hear and see on the Day they come to Us! But today the wrongdoers are clearly misguided. . Warn them of the Day of Remorse when all matters will be decided, but they are heedless and they do not believe. . It is We Who will inherit the earth and all those who are on it, and to Us they will be returned.","[9] i.e., far exalted is He above any such need. . [10] Some believed that Jesus was God or the son of God, whereas those who truly followed him considered him only as Allah's messenger."
19,41,50,"And mention, to them, in the Book Abraham, that is, [mention] his tale. Indeed he was a truth¬ 
ful one ([the intensive form siddiq] means ‘extremely truthful’), a prophet (the following [Statement] 
substitutes for the [preceding] predicate). 7 When he said to his father, Azar, ‘O my father! (the [final] ta here [of abati\ has replaced the 
[possessive] ya of [genitive] annexation [sc. of yd abt]; the two, however, are never used together) — he 
[Abraham’s father] used to worship idols. Why do you worship that which neither hears nor sees, and is 
of no avail to you, suffices you [not], in any way? whether in [terms of] benefit or harm. O my father! Indeed there has come to me of knowledge that which has not come to you. So fol¬ 
low me that I may guide you to a path, a route, that is right, [that is] Straight. 

5 In other words if one reads the Arabic as anna, then the following is implicit, ‘Mention that God is my Lord ...’; and if one reads 
it as inna, then the following is implicit, ‘Say, “Indeed God is my Lord’”, so that the former introduces a subordinate clause, while 
the latter emphasises an independent one. 

6 In other words, ‘they’ of the previous statement are identified subsequently as ‘the evildoers’. 

7 In other words, the sentence that follows, idh qdla li-abihi, substitutes for the predicate of kdna, namely, siddiqan nabiyyan.

Tafsir al-Jalalayn O my father! Do not worship Satan, by obeying him through [your] worship of idols. Truly 
Satan is disobedient ([the intensive form ‘asiyyan] means ‘one given to disobedience’) to the Compas¬ 
sionate One. O my father! I do fear left a chastisement from the Compassionate One should befall you, if you 
do not repent, and then you become an ally of Satan, an assistant and a comrade [of his] in the Fire. He said, ‘Are you renouncing my gods, O Abraham?, so that you are denouncing them [in this 
way] ? If you do not desift, from criticising them, I shall surely assail you, with atones, or with evil words, 
so beware of me; and flay away from me for a long time’. He said, ‘Peace be to you, from me — in other words, I shall not cause you any harm. I shall 
ask forgiveness of my Lord for you. Truly He is ever gracious to me ( hafiyyan, from hafiyyun, meaning 
barrun, ‘kind’) answering my prayers. And indeed he [Abraham] fulfilled his above-mentioned promise 
[as described] in [surat] al-Shuara, And forgive my father [Q. 26:86]; but this was before it became clear 
to him that he [Abraham’s father] was an enemy of God, as mentioned in [surat] Bara a [Q. 9:114]. And I shall shun you and that which you call upon, [that which] you worship, besides God. I will 
supplicate, I will worship, my Lord — hopefully in calling upon, in worshipping, my Lord I shall not be 
wretched’, as you have become wretched by your worship of idols. And so after he had shunned them and that which they worshipped besides God, by having set 
off to the Holy Land, We gave him, two sons for him to find solace in, Isaac and Jacob, and each, of the 
two, We made a prophet. And We gave them, all three [of them], out of Our mercy, wealth and offering, and We assigned 
for them a worthy repute [one] that is lofty, sublime, namely, [We assigned] fair praise [of them] among 
all the members of the [Abrahamic] religions.","And mention in the Book [the story of] Abraham. He was indeed a man of truth and a prophet. . When he said to his father, “O my dear father, why do you worship something that neither hears nor sees nor benefits you in any way? . O my dear father, there has come to me some knowledge that has not come to you, so follow me; I will guide you to a straight path. . O my dear father, do not worship Satan. Indeed, Satan is rebellious against the Most Compassionate. . O my dear father, I truly fear that a punishment from the Most Compassionate may afflict you and that you may become a companion of Satan [in Hell].” . He said, “Are you turning away from my gods, O Abraham? If you do not desist, I will surely stone you. Keep away from me for a long time!” . Abraham said, “Peace be on you[11]. I will seek my Lord’s forgiveness for you. Indeed, He is Most Gracious to me. . I will distance myself from you and from all that you supplicate besides Allah, and I will supplicate my Lord; perhaps my supplication to my Lord will not go unanswered.” . When he distanced himself from them and what they worshiped besides Allah, We granted him Isaac and Jacob and made each one of them a prophet. . We bestowed upon them of Our mercy and blessed them with a highly-esteemed reputation[12].","[11] i.e., You are secure from me, so I will not harm you in the least. . [12] As part of the prayer, Muslims invoke Allah’s blessings upon Muhammad (ﷺ) and his family and Abraham (ﷺ) and his family, on a daily basis."
19,51,58,"And mention in the Book Moses. Indeed he was devoted [to God] (read either as mukhlisan, to 
mean ‘one sincerely devoted to worship [of God]’; or read mukhlasan, [to mean ‘he was delivered’] as in 
God had delivered him from defilement) and he was a messenger, a prophet. And We called him — with the words, ‘O Moses! Verily I am God’ [Q. 27:9] — from the right side 
of the Mount (al-Tiir, is [actually] the name of a mountain) 8 that is, [from the side] to the right of Moses 
as he was approaching [the Mount] from Midian; and We brought him near in communion, as God, 
exalted be He, made him hear His ,<]ieech. And We gave him out of Our mercy. Our grace, his brother Aaron (Harun, either a substitution 
[for akhahu, ‘his brother’], or an explicative supplement [thereof]), [likewise] a prophet (nabiyyan, a cir¬ 
cumstantial qualifier, constituting the import of the ‘gift’ [to Moses], which was in response to his [Mo¬ 
ses’s] request that He [God] send forth his brother with him; he [Aaron] was older in years than him). And mention in the Book Ishmael. Indeed he was true to his promise — he never promised 
anything which he did not fulfil; he [once] waited for three days for someone whom he had promised 
[to meet]; or [it is said that he waited] an entire year until that person [finally] returned to the place in 
which he [Ishamel] was [supposed to have met the former]; and he was a messenger, to [the tribe of] 
Jurhum, a prophet [likewise]. He used to enjoin upon his kinsfolk, that is, his people,prayer and the [payment of] alms, and 
he was pleasing to his Lord (mardiyyan, ‘pleasing’, is actually marduwwun, but both waw letters have 
been changed to two ya letters, while the kasra vowel [has also been changed to] a damma vowel). 

8 This means that the translation should properly be ‘from the right side of [Mount] Tur’; however, the consensus is that tur in 
Arabic actually means ‘mountain’.

Sura Maryam And mention in the Book Idris , 9 who was Noah’s great-grandfather. Indeed he was a truthful 
one, a prophet. And We raised him to a high Station — he is alive in the fourth, or sixth, or seventh heaven, or 
[he is] in Paradise into which he was admitted after he was made to experience death and brought back 
to life, and he has not exited therefrom. Those (ulaika is the subject) to whom God has been gracious (alladhina anama’Llahu ‘alayhim 
is an adjectival qualification of it [of the subjed]) from among the prophets (mina’l-nabiyyina, an ex¬ 
plication of it [of the subjed] functioning like an adjectival qualification in terms of import. That which 
follows it [mina’l-nabiyyina, ‘from among the prophets’] up to [where] the conditional sentence begins, 
constitutes an adjectival qualification of al-nabiyyina, ‘the prophets’; and so His saying ... ) 10 of the seed 
of Adam, namely, Idris, and of those whom We carried with Noah, in the Ark, namely, Abraham — [who 
is the] son of his [Noah’s] son Shem (Sam) — and of the seed of Abraham, namely, Ishmael, Isaac and 
Jacob, and, of the seed of, Israel — who is Jacob — namely, Moses, Aaron, Zachariah, John and Jesus, 
and from among those whom We guided and chose, that is to say, from among their number 11 (the 
predicate of ulaika, ‘those’, is [the following, idha tutla ...]) when the signs of the Compassionate One 
were recited to them, they would fall down prostrating and weeping (these [sujjadan and bukiyyan ] 
constitute the plural [forms] of sajid, ‘prostrate’, and bdkin, ‘weeping’ [respectively]) in other words [what 
is meant is]: be [you] like them ( bukiyyun is originally [formed from] bakuyyin, but the wdw is changed 
into a ya and the damma vowel into a kasra).","And mention in the Book [the story of] Moses. He was indeed a chosen one and was a messenger and a prophet[13]. . We called him from the right side of Mount Tūr [in Sinai] and We brought him near by conversing with him in private. . And We granted him, by Our mercy, his brother Aaron, as a prophet. . And mention in the Book [the story of] Ishmael. He was true to his promise and was a messenger and a prophet. . He used to command his people to pray and give zakah, and his Lord was well pleased with him. . And mention in the Book [the story of] Idrīs[14]. He was a man of truth and a prophet. . And We raised him to a high status[15]. . These are the prophets whom Allah has favored from among the descendants of Adam, and from those whom We carried with Noah [in the Ark], and from the descendants of Abraham and Israel [i.e., Jacob], and from those whom We guided and chose. Whenever the verses of the Most Compassionate were recited to them, they fell down in prostration, weeping.","[13] A messenger (rasūl) is one who was sent by Allah to reform society with a new law, such as Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, etc. A prophet (nabī) is one who is charged by Allah to reform society following the law of the messenger before him, such as Jacob, Isaac, Solomon, etc. Prophets are more numerous than messengers. . [14] i.e., Prophet Enoch (عليه السلام). . [15] Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) met Prophet Idrīs (ﷺ) in the fourth heaven."
19,59,65,"But there succeeded after them a posterity who neglected the prayer, by abandoning [perform¬ 
ance of] it, [a posterity] such as the Jews and the Christians, and followed [their] luSts, in the way of 
aCts of disobedience. So they shall [soon] encounter Ghayy — a valley in Hell — that is, they shall fall 
into it; whereas those who repent and believe and att righteously — such shall enter Paradise and shall 
not be wronged, they shall [not] be diminished, in any way, in their reward; [they shall enter] Gardens of Eden, as [a place of] residence ( janndti Adnin, substitutes for 
al-janna, ‘Paradise’) which the Compassionate One has promised to His servants [a promise] in the 
Unseen ( bi’l-ghaybi, a circumstantial qualifier, in other words [a promise made while] they do not see 
it). Indeed His promise, that is to say, that which He promises, is ever fulfilled, meaning that it always 
arrives (the original [form of ma’tiyyan] is ma’tuyun ); or [what is meant by] His promise here is Paradise, 
to which those deserving of it shall arrive. Therein they shall not hear anything that is trifling, of talk, but, they shall hear, only [a greet¬ 
ing of] ‘Peace!’, from the angels to them, or from some among them to others. And therein they will 
have their provision morning and evening, in other words, according to the [equivalent] measure of 
these two in the [life of this] world, since there is no day or night in Paradise, only everlasting light and 
illumination. That is the Paradise which We shall give as inheritance, [which] We shall grant and [in which] 
We shall lodge, those of Our servants who are God-fearing, through [their] obedience of Him. When the Revelation 12 did not come for a number of days, the Prophet (s) said to Gabriel, ‘What 
prevents you from visiting us more often than you do?’ and so the following was revealed: And We do 
not descend except by the commandment of your Lord. To Him belongs all that is before us, namely, 
ahead of us, of the affairs of the Hereafter, and all that is behind us, of the affairs of this world, and all

10 This statement by the commentator fa-qawluhu, ‘and so His saying ...’ is not actually resolved later; but in light of what he has

that is between those [two], namely, all that takes place from this [point in] time until the coming of the 
Hour, in other words, to Him belongs knowledge of all of those things. And your Lord is never forgetful, 
meaning that He is never neglectful of you [even] when the Revelation is postponed from [being sent 
to] you. He is, the Lord, the Owner, of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. So wor¬ 
ship Him and be fteadfaft in His worship, in other words, [continue to] perform it patiently. Do you 
know [of] anyone who could be His namesake?, [anyone] named with that [same title]? No!","But they were succeeded by generations who neglected prayer and pursued their desires; so they will meet their doom[16], . except those who repent and believe, and do righteous deeds – it is they who will enter Paradise and they will not be wronged in the least. .

To Him belongs all that is before us, all that is behind us, and all that is in between. Your Lord is never forgetful. . Lord of the heavens and earth and all that is between them.

19,66,72,"And man, the denier of the Resurrection — namely, Ubayy b. Khalaf or al-Walid b. al-Mughira, 
concerning whom the verse was revealed — says, ‘When (read a-idha, either pronouncing the second 
hamza, or not, but inserting an alif between the two [hamzas] in both [readings]) I am dead, shall I then 
be brought forth alive?’, from the grave, as Muhammad (s) says? (the interrogative [here] statement is 
meant as a denial, in other words [he means to say] I shall not be brought forth alive after death; ma [of 
ma mittu, ‘I am dead’] is extra, for emphasis, likewise [extra is] the lam [of la-sawfa, ‘shall I then]). He 
[God] then responds to him with the following saying [of His], exalted be He: Does not man then remember (yadhdhakaru, is actually yatadhakkaru, but the ta has been 
changed to a dhal and assimilated with the [other] dhal, a variant reading leaves it as yadhkuru ) that We 
created him before, when he was nothing?, and thus infer from the first aCt [of creation] the [possibility 
of] resurrection. For by your Lord, We will surely gather them, namely, the deniers of the Resurrection, and the 
devils, that is to say, We shall gather every one of them with his devil [bound together] in a chain; then 
We shall bring them around Hell, [around] the outside of it, crouching, on their knees ( [jithiyyan is] the 
plural of jathin, and is originally [formed as] jathawuwwin or jathawiyyun [deriving] from [the verb] 
jatha, [imperfect tense] yajthu or yajthi, two [variant] forms). Then We shall pluck out from every party, every secft, whichever of them was mo ft hardened in 
disdain, in insolence, of the Compassionate One. Then indeed We shall know be ft those moil deserving of it, most worthy of [being in] Hell, 
the mo St hardened of them and others [like them], for the burning, for the admission [into it] and the 
scorching [therein], and We shall Start with them ([siliyyan is] originally [formed as] salawiyyun, from 
[the verb] saliya or salaya). There is not one of you but shall come to it, that is, [but] shall enter Hell. That is an inevitability 
[already] decreed by your Lord, [something which] He made inevitable and [which] He decreed; He 
will not waive it. Then We will deliver (read nunajji or nunji) those who were wary, of [committing] idolatry or 
disbelief, [We will deliver them] from it, and leave those who did wrong, by way of idolatry and disbelief, 
crouching therein, on their knees.","Man says, “Once I am dead, will I be raised to life again?” . Does man not remember that We created him beforehand when he was nothing? . By your Lord, We will surely gather them and the devils, then We will surely bring them all around Hell on their knees[19]. . Then We will surely drag out of every group those who were most rebellious against the Most Compassionate. . For indeed We know best those who are most deserving to burn therein. . There is none among you except that he will pass over it[20]; a decree from your Lord that must be fulfilled. . Then We will save those who fear Allah and will leave the wrongdoers in it on their knees.","[19] i.e., out of terror they will be on their knees or dragged unwillingly while on their knees. . [20] Referring to the bridge of As-Sirāt, which is placed over Hell. Everyone will pass on it. The believers will cross it easily, each according to their faith, whereas the disbelievers and the hypocrites will fall into the Fire from the bridge."
19,73,76,"And when Our manifest, evident ( bayyinatin, ‘manifest’, is a circumstantial qualifier) signs, in 
the Qur’an, are recited to them, namely, [to] the believers and the disbelievers, those who disbelieve say 
to those who believe, ‘Which of the two parties — us or you — is better in ftation, in lodging and abode

from the [fourth form] aqama, ‘he took up residence’) and more excellent in assembly?’ ( nadiyyan, 
meaning the place in which a folk assemble and converse). They [the disbelievers] mean ‘we [are the bet¬

communities of the paSt, have We destroyed before them, who were superior in [their possession of] 
gear, in wealth and chattel, and in appearance, [superior] as a sight ( ri’yan derives from [the infinitive] 
al-ru’ya). Thus in the same way that We destroyed those [ones] because of their disbelief. We will destroy

these [ones also]. Say: ‘As for him who is in error ( man kdna fi’l-dalalati, a conditional clause, the response to 
which is [fa’l-yamdud, ‘He shall prolong’ and what follows it]) the Compassionate One shall defer (fa’l- 
yamdud, functions in the sense of a predicate) him, from chastisement by [granting him] some respite, 
in this world, drawing him on [to his eventual chastisement] gradually, until, when they catch sight of 
that which they were promised, whether it be chastisement [in this world], by being killed or taken 
captive, or the Hour, the Resurrection that comprises Hell, they will enter it. Then they will surely know 
who is worse in [reSpedl of] position and weaker in [reSped of the number of] hods’, in [reSjieCt of the 
number of] supporters, themselves or the believers? Their hoSts will be the devils, while the hoSts of the 
believers againSt them will be the angels. And God increases in guidance those who found [right] guidance, through faith, [increasing 
them] by way of the signs He reveals to them; and the enduring things, the righteous deeds — namely, 
obedience [the reward of] which endures for that person — are better in your Lord’s sight in [terms of] 
reward, and better in [terms of the] return, that is, as something which will be repaid and returned to 
him [the believer], in contrast to the deeds of the disbelievers. The [use of the qualification] khayr, ‘bet¬ 
ter’, here is meant to counter [the use of the same in] their Statement, 'Which of the two parties is better 
in Station?’ [above, Q. 19:73].","When Our verses are recited to them in all their clarity, the disbelievers say to the believers, “Which of the two parties is better in terms of dwellings and superior in social gatherings?”[21] . How many generations We have destroyed before them who were superior in terms of wealth and outward appearance! . Say, “Whoever is following misguidance, the Most Compassionate will give him respite, until they see what they were warned of – be it the punishment [in this world] or the Hour – only then will they realize who is in a worse abode and who has a smaller following.” . Allah increases in guidance those who are guided, and the righteous deeds of lasting merit are better with your Lord in reward and better in return.",[21] In regard to the life of this world.

b. al-Aratt 14 — who had said to him, ‘You will be resurrected after death!’, and who had requested from 
him repayment of money — ‘I shall assuredly be given, on the supposition that there is [such a thing as] 
resurrection, wealth and children?’, and so I will repay you [then], God, exalted be He, says: Has he come to learn [something] of the Unseen, that is, has he been given [some] knowledge 
of it and [of the faCt] that he will be given what he has mentioned (here the interrogative hamza [of 
a-ittalaa, ‘has he come to learn?’] suffices in place of the conjunctive hamza, which has therefore been 
omitted) or has he made a covenant with the Compassionate One?, to [the effeCt that he] be given what 
he claims? Nay, he shall not be given [any of] that, but We will assuredly write down. We shall command 
that it be written down, that which he says and prolong for him the chastisement endlessly. We shall give 
him because of that [claim] an extra chastisement, in addition to the chastisement for his disbelief; and We shall take over from him that which he talks about, of wealth and children, and he shall 
come to Us, on the Day of Resurrection, alone, with neither wealth nor children. And they, namely, the disbelievers of Mecca, have taken besides God, graven images [as], [other] 
gods, for them to worship, that they may be for them a [source of] might, [that they may be] intercessors

gods, shall reject their worship, that is, they will deny it — as [is Stated] in another verse: It was not us 
that they used to worship [Q. 28:63]) — and they shall be [pitted] againSt them as opponents, enemies, 
supporting one another [againSt them]. Have you not regarded that We unleash the devils againSt, We have set them upon, the disbe¬ 
lievers to urge them, to incite them to [commit] aCts of disobedience, impetuously? So do not make haSte againSt them, to demand [that they receive] chastisement. Indeed We

apart (a variant reading has yanfatirna), because of it and the earth [is almost] Tplit asunder, and the 
mountains [almost] fall down crashing, collapsing on top of them, because of [the fad]: that they have ascribed a son to the Compassionate One. God, exalted be He, says: when it is not meet for [ the Majesty of] the Compassionate One to take a son, that is to say, such 
a thing does not befit Him. There is none in the heavens and the earth but he comes to the Compassionate One as a servant, 
servile, submissive, on the Day of Resurrection, including [individuals such as] Ezra and Jesus. Verily He knows their number and has counted them precisely, and therefore [the knowledge

wealth or any helper to protecft him.","They say, “The Most Compassionate has begotten a son.” .

as an affirmative, [but it is expressed as an interrogative] in order that the miracle [to be manifested] in

consume them; and I have uses for it (ma’drib, ‘uses’, is the plural of ma’ruba, with the ra taking any 
[one] of the three vowels [sc. ma’ruba, ma’raba or ma’riba] meaning needs’) in other ways, such as [us¬ 
ing it] to carry food supplies and waterskins, as well as to drive away [undesirable] animals. He [Moses] 
gives an extensive response to indicate his [many] needs for it. Hesaid, ‘CaSt it down, O Moses!’ And he caSt it down, and lo! it was a serpent, a giant snake, moving swiftly, moving about on its 
belly swiftly with the ^eed of a small snake — which is called al-jann and which is [also] used to refer to 
this [serpent] in another verse [Q. 27:10; Q. 28:31]. Hesaid, ‘Take [hold of] it and do not fear, it. We will restore it to its former Slate ( sirataha, in the 
accusative because the genitive-operating preposition has been removed). 3 And so he placed his hand in 
its mouth and it became a ftaff once again; and it became clear that the place into which he put his hand 
was the place where it [the ftaff] is held, between its two prongs. Moses was shown this [miracle] left he

side, below the arm into the armpit, and [then] take it out — it will emerge white, in contraft to the 
skin-colour that it was, without any fault, that is, [without any sign of] leprosy, radiating like the rays of 
the sun, blinding to the eyes [of onlookers]. [That is]yet another sign ( ayatan ukhrd: this together with 
bayda’a, ‘white’, conftitute two circumftantial qualifiers referring to the subject of [the verb] takhruj, ‘it 
will emerge’). That We may show you, thereby, when you do this [as described above] in order to manifeft it, 
of Our greatest signs, the sign that is the greateft proof of [the truth of] your Mission [from God]: and 
should he want it to be reftored to its former ftate, he would thruft it into his armpit, as has been men¬ 
tioned, and [then] bring it out. Go, as a messenger [from God], to Pharaoh, and [to] those with him. He has indeed trans¬ 
gressed’, he has exceeded the [usual] limits in his disbelief by claiming to be a god.","What is that in your right hand, O Moses?” . He said, “It is my staff. I lean on it and beat down leaves with it for my sheep, and I have other uses for it.”[6] . Allah said, “Throw it down, O Moses!” . He threw it down, and it suddenly became a slithering snake. . Allah said, “Pick it up and have no fear. We will restore it to its former state. . Put your hand under your armpit; it will come out shining white without blemish, as another sign[7], . so that We may show you some of Our greatest signs. . Go to Pharaoh, for he has transgressed all bounds.”","[6] Moses could only say, “A staff.” But he instead gave details about the staff, for he was interested in prolonging the conversation with Allah. .

confirm’, and ashrikhu, ‘let him share’] are in the imperative and in the apocopated imperfedt tense, con¬ 
stituting the response to the request [of Moses]). So that we may glorify You, [by making] glorifications, over and over again, and remember You, [by making] remembrance, over and over again. Indeed You are ever Seeing of us’, ever Knowing, having been gracious [to us] by way of [ap¬

So, he asked Allah to help him overcome this hurdle, and Allah answered his prayer."
20,38,48,"when ( idh, for explanation [of that favour]) We revealed to your mother, either in [her] sleep or 
by way of inspiration — when she gave birth to you and feared that Pharaoh would have you slain for 
being one of the newborn [of the Children of Israel] — that which was revealed, regarding your affair 
(this [ma yuha, ‘that which was revealed’] is substituted by [what follows, an iqdhifihi ...]), “CaSt him, place him, in the ark, then caSt him, [while] in the ark, into the river, [into] the flow 
of the Nile, and then the river shall throw him up onto the shore, that is, its bank (the imperative here 
[ fa’l-yulqihi, ‘let it throw him’] functions as a predicate); [there] an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his, 
namely, Pharaoh, shall take him”. And, after he took you, I caSt upon you love from Me, that you may 
be loved by people; and indeed Pharaoh, and all who saw you, loved you; and that you might be reared 
under My eyes, be nurtured under My guardianship and My protection of you. When (idh, for explanation) your siSler, Maryam, 5 walked up, to obtain news of you, for they 
had brought wet nurses [for you] but you would not take to the breaSt of any of them, and she then said, 
“Shall I show you someone who will take care of him?”. Her offer was accepted and so she brought 
[them] his mother and he took to her breaSts. Thus We restored you to your mother that her eyes might 
rejoice, in seeing you again, and not grieve, at that point [anymore]. Then you slew a sold, namely, the 
Copt 6 in Egypt — and you became distressed for having slain him because of [how] Pharaoh [would 
read:]; whereupon We delivered you from [great] distress, and We tried you with various ordeals. We 
teSted you by landing you in some other [ordeal] and [again] delivered you from it. Then you Stayed 
for several years, ten [years], among the people of Midian, after you had reached it having left Egypt, 
[Staying] with the prophet Shu'ayb and marrying his daughter. Then you came [hither] as ordained, in 
My knowledge, with the Message [that you will deliver] — and this was when you were forty years old, 
O Moses! And I chose you for Myself, to deliver the Message. 

4 Literally, zahri means ‘my back’. 

5 Moses’ sifter is not named in Exodus 2:4. 

6 The literal rendition of al-qibti as ‘Copt’ is actually precise, as it derives from Greek Aiguptios; and it should be taken as an indica¬ 
tor of ethnicity for the ancient inhabitants of Egypt, whom the Medieval Muslims diftinguished from Egyptians of Arab descent 
(poft-conqueft). Clearly, here ‘Copt’ is not to be confused with the pre-Islamic Monophysite Chriftian community.

Tafsir al-Jalalayn Go, you and your brother, to the people, with My, nine, signs, and do not flag, be remiss, in 
remembrance of Me, by uttering glorifications and otherwise. Go the two of you to Pharaoh. Truly he has transgressed [the bounds], in claiming to be 
the Lord. And Speak to him gentle words, for him to renounce such [claims], that perhaps he may be 
mindful, be admonished, or fear’, God and so repent — the ‘hope’ [for Pharaoh’s repentance] is [ex¬ 
pressed] from their perspective, for God knows that he was not going to repent. The two [of them] said, ‘Our Lord, We truly fear that he may forestall us, that is, by hastening 
to punish us, or become tyrannical’, against us, that is, be high-handed [with us]. He said, ‘Do not fear, for I shall be with the two of you, by [providing you with] My assistance, 
hearing, what he says, and seeing, what he does. So go to him and say, “Truly we are two messengers of your Lord, so let the Children of Israel 
go with us, to Syria, and do not [continue to] chastise them, in other words, release them from your 
exploitation of them in those oppressive works of yours, such as digging, construction and the lifting of 
heavy objects. We have verily brought you a sign, a definitive argument, from your Lord, as proof of our 
truthfulness in [delivering] the Message; and may peace be upon him who follows [right] guidance, that 
is to say, may he be secure from [God’s] chastisement. Indeed it has been revealed to us that the chastisement shall befall him who denies, [the truth 
of] what we have brought, and turns away” ’, [and who] rejects it. And so they came to him and said [to 
him] all of what has been mentioned.","when We inspired your mother, saying, . ‘Put him into the casket, then cast it into the river. The river will carry it to the shore, and he will be picked up by one who is an enemy to Me and enemy to him.’ I bestowed upon you love from Myself[9] so that you would be brought up under My [watchful] Eye. . When your sister was going along and said, ‘Shall I show you someone who will nurse him?’ Thus We brought you back to your mother, so that she may rejoice and not grieve[10]. Then you killed a man [by mistake][11], but We saved you from distress, and We put you through several trials. You stayed among the people of Midian for several years, then you came [here] at a destined time, O Moses. . I have chosen you for Myself. . Go forth, you and your brother, with My signs, and do not slacken in remembering Me. . Go, both of you, to Pharaoh, for he has certainly transgressed all bounds. .

20,49,55,"He said, ‘So who is your Lord, O Moses?’ — he [Pharaoh] restricted this [question] to him [Mo¬ 
ses], because [between him and Aaron] he is the principal [bearer of God’s Message] and also because of 
his [Pharaoh’s] having pampered him while he was being reared [as a child]. He said, ‘Our Lord is He Who gave to everything, in creation, its [peculiar] nature, through 
which it is distinguished from another [thing], and then guided [it]’, the animal among them to its 
source of food, drink and procreation and in other ways. He, Pharaoh, said, ‘So what of, the Status [of], the generations, the communities, of old?’, such as 
the people of Noah, Hud, Lot and Salih, with regard to their having worshipped graven images. Said he, Moses, ‘The knowledge thereof, that is, the knowledge of their [otherworldly] Status, is, 
preserved, with my Lord, in a Book, namely, the Preserved Tablet ( al-lawh al-mahfuz), and He shall re¬ 
quite them in accordance with it on the Day of Resurrection. My Lord does not err. He is [never] absent 
from anything, nor does He, my Lord, forget, anything. He is, the One Who made for you, as well as [for] all creatures, the earth a cradle, a bed, and 
threaded, facilitated, for you therein ways, roads, and sent down from the heaven water, rain. God, 
exalted be He, says, as a complement to Moses’s description of Him and as an address to the people of 
Mecca: and therewith We brought forth various kinds. Species, of plants ( shatta, ‘various’, adjeCt ivally 
qualifies azwdjan, ‘kinds’), in other words, [plants] of different colours, flavours and [different] in other 
ways ( shatta is the plural of shatit, similar [in pattern] to marid, [plural] marda, as [may be used] in [a 
phrase like] shatta al-amr, ‘the affair has become divided’). Eat, thereof, and pasture your cattle, therein {an dm, cattle’, is the plural of naam, which are 
camels, cows and sheep; one says matu’l-anamu, ‘the cattle grazed’ or raaytuha, ‘I grazed them’; the 
imperative here is meant as a permissive and a reminder of [God’s] grace, the sentence being a circum¬ 
stantial qualifier referring to the subject of [the verb] akhrajnd, ‘We brought forth’, in other words [what 
is meant is], ‘[We brought forth the plants] permitting you to eat thereof and to graze [your] cattle 
[thereon]’). In that, which is mentioned here, there are indeed signs, indeed lessons, for people of sense.

it We shall restore you, [when you are] interred after death, and from it We shall bring you forth, at the 
Resurrection, a second time’, in the same way that We brought you forth [from it] when We initiated 
your creation.","Pharaoh said, “So who is the Lord of you two, O Moses?” . He said, “Our Lord is the One Who gave everything its form and then guided it.” . Pharaoh said, “Then what about the former [disbelieving] nations?” . He said, “Its knowledge is with my Lord in a Record. My Lord never errs, nor does He forget.” . It is He Who spread out the earth for you and made therein pathways for you, and sent down rain from the sky; and We brought forth thereby various types of plants. . Eat and graze your livestock.

20,56,69,"And verily We showed him, that is, We made Pharaoh see, all Our signs, [all] nine, but he denied, 
them, and claimed that they were [the result of] sorcery, and refused, to affirm the Oneness [of God],

equal diftance (read si wan or suwan), in other words, in the middle, equidistant for a person coming 
from either side. Said he, Moses, ‘Your try ft shall be the Day of Adornment — a feStive day of theirs on which 
they adorn themselves and [the public] assemble — and let the people assemble, [let] the inhabitants of 
Egypt gather, at forenoon’, the time for this [trySt], to observe what will transpire. Then Pharaoh withdrew, retreated, and summoned up his guile, that is to say, those [human] 
elements of his guile from among the sorcerers, and then came, with them to the tryst. Moses said to them — and there were 72 of them, each with a rope and a Staff in his hand — 
‘Woe to you!, meaning, may God make you liable to woe. Do not invent a lie againft God, by ascribing 
partners to Him, left He annihilate you (read fa-yushitakum or fa-yashatakum) by some chaftisement, 
from Him. For verily he who invents lies, againSt God, fails’, [he] is the loser. So they difputed their matter among themselves, regarding Moses and his brother, and kept 
secret their private counsel, that is, their conversation regarding the two, I 7 i ey said, to each other, ‘These two men ( hadhan, this [form] concords with the forms used

umphing. And caft that which is in your right hand — and this was his daff. It shall swallow up that which 
they have produced. For what they have produced is only a sorcerer’s trick, that is to say, a kind thereof, 
and the sorcerer does not succeed wherever he may go’, in his sorcery. So Moses cad his daff and it swal¬ 
lowed up all of that which they [had] produced.","We showed Pharaoh all Our signs, but he rejected them and refused to believe. .

the second changed to an alif) in him before 1, myself, give you permission? He is indeed your chief, your 
teacher, who taught you sorcery. I shall assuredly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides ( min 
khildfin, a circumdantial qualifier meaning ‘alternate [hands and feet]’, in other words, the right hands 
and the left feet) and I shall assuredly crucify you on the trunks of palm trees. And you shall then know 
which of us — meaning himself and the Lord of Moses — is harsher in [inflicting] chastisement, and 
[which of us is] more lasting’, more enduring in [sudaining] opposition to him [Moses]. They said, ‘We will not choose you over what has come to us of clear signs, proving the truthful¬ 
ness of Moses, and [over] Him Who originated us, created us (wa’lladhi fatarana, either an oath, 9 or a 
supplement to [the preceding] md, ‘what’). Decree what you will decree, that is, do what you say. What 
you decree is only [relevant] in the life of this world (al-hayata’l-dunya, is in the accusative because 
the scope [of his decree] is being indicated, in other words ‘[you can only decree] in if); yet you will be 
requited for it in the Hereafter. Indeed We profess belief in our Lord, that He may forgive us our sins, in the way of ascribing 
partners [to God] and otherwise, and the sorcery to which you forced us, to learn and to perform in 
order to oppose Moses. And God is better, than you in rewarding if he is obeyed, and more enduring’, 
than you in chadisement if he is disobeyed. God, exalted be He, says: Truly whoever comes to his Lord a criminal, a disbeliever, like Phar¬ 
aoh, for him there shall be Hell wherein he shall neither die, and thus find red, nor live, a life of any 
benefit to him. And whoever comes to Him a believer, having performed righteous deeds — the obligatory and 
supererogatory deeds, for such shall be the highest degrees ( al-‘ula, the plural ot'ulyd, the feminine form

Eden] is an explication thereof [of al-darajatu’l-ula, ‘the highed degrees’]) underneath which rivers 
flow, abiding therein, and that is the reward of him who keeps pure, of sins.","So the magicians fell down in prostration[17], saying, “We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.” . Pharaoh said, “How dare you believe in him before I give you permission! He must be your master who taught you magic! I will surely cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and I will crucify you on the trunks of palm trees; you will surely know whose punishment is more severe and more lasting!” . They said, “We will never prefer you over the clear signs that have come to us, or over the One Who created us[18]. So decide whatever you will. You can only make a decision about the life of this world. . We surely believe in our Lord so that He may forgive us our sins and the magic that you have compelled us to practice, for Allah is best [in reward] and more lasting [in punishment].” . Whoever comes to his Lord as an evildoer, for him is Hell; he will neither die therein nor live[19]. . But whoever comes to Him as a believer, having done righteous deeds, it is they who will have the highest ranks: . Gardens of Eternity, under which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. Such is the reward of those who purify themselves[20].","[17] They realized that the miracles of Moses were not impressions of magic, but absolute realities. . [18] It can also be interpreted as an oath, i.e., “By the One Who created us, we will never prefer you over...”. . [19] He will neither die to relax from punishment, nor live a pleasant life. .

nay he led them to destruction, in contrast to what he said [to them] , and I guide you only to the path of 
reditude [Q. 40:29].","We inspired Moses, “Travel by night with My slaves, and strike for them a dry path across the sea. Have no fear of being overtaken, nor be afraid [of drowning].” . Then Pharaoh pursued them with his soldiers, but they were completely overwhelmed by the sea[21]. . Thus Pharaoh led his people astray and did not guide them.","[21] i.e., not only drowning in water but other things which are only known to Allah such as terror, pain, regret, etc."

them adray’, so they took to worshipping the [golden] calf.","[Allah asked], “What made you hasten from your people, O Moses?”[24] . He said, “They are following my footsteps; I hastened to You, my Lord, to please You.” .

namely, the Samaritan and his followers, said, ‘This is your God and the God of Moses: so he, Moses, 
forgot’, his Lord here and set off in search of him. God, exalted be He, says: Did they not see that ([in alia ] an has been softened in place of the hardened form, with its sub¬

that it did not give them any response in return, nor did it have any power over hurt for them, that is, 
[any power] to prevent it, or any benefit?, that is, [any power] to procure it [for them], in other words, 
how can such [a thing] be taken as a god? And Aaron had certainly said to them beforehand, that is, before the return of Moses, ‘O my 
people, you are only being tested thereby! But truly your Lord is the Compassionate One, so follow me, 
in worship of Him, and obey my command’, therein. They said, ‘We will not cease to cling to it, persisting in worship of it, until Moses returns to us’. He, Moses, said, upon his return, ‘O Aaron, what held you back when you saw them going 
aftray, by worshipping it, that ( [alia] read an [instead], the Id being extra) you did not follow me? Did you then disobey my 
command?’, by remaining among those who worship [something] other than God, exalted be He? He, Aaron, said, ‘O son of my mother (read ya’bna’ummi or ya’bna’umma, meaning ummi, ‘my 
mother’) the mention of her is more effective in provoking the affecftion of his heart — do not clutch my 
beard, which he had seized with his left hand, or my head!, for he had seized his hair with his right hand 
in anger. Indeed I feared that, if I followed you, for inevitably a group of those who did not worship the 
calf would have followed me, you would have said, “You have caused division among the Children of 
Israel — and have been furious with me — and you did not wait for my word’”, concerning what my 
opinion would have been in this matter.","So Moses returned to his people, angry and sorrowful. He said, “O my people, did your Lord not promise you a good promise[26]? Was my absence too long for you, or did you want the wrath from your Lord to befall you, so you broke your promise to me[27]?” . They said, “We did not break our promise to you out of our own free will, but we were made to carry loads of the people’s jewelry, so we threw them [into the fire], and so did the Sāmiri throw.”[28] . Then he molded for them an image of a calf that made a mooing sound. They said, “This is your god and Moses’ god, but he has forgotten.” . Do they not see that it does not respond a word to them, nor does it have the power to harm or benefit them? . Aaron told them beforehand, “O my people, you are being tested with it. Your Lord is the Most Compassionate, so follow me and obey my command.” . They said, “We will never cease to worship it until Moses comes back to us.” . Moses said, “O Aaron, what prevented you when you saw them going astray, . from following me? Did you disobey my command?”[29] . Aaron said, “O son of my mother, do not seize me by my beard or by my head!

du£t from that mentioned [hoof] and ca£t it onto what possessed no dj^irit, so that it might [thus] acquire 
a dj?irit. I had seen that your people had asked that you make for them a god, and so my soul suggested 
to me [the idea] that this calf should be their god. Said he, Moses to him, ‘Begone! It shall be yours [as your lot] throughout life, that is, for the 
duration of your life, to say, to whomever you may see, “Do not touch [me]!”, that is, do not come near 
me — he used to wander about [aimlessly] throughout the land, and whenever he touched a person, or 
a person touched him, both would succumb to a fever. And indeed there will be a try ft for you, for you 
to be chastised, which you will not fail to keep (read lan tukhlifahu, meaning ‘[a trydt] which you shall 
not miss’; or lan tukhlafahu, ‘for which you will not be forgotten, meaning: ‘nay you will be sent forth 
to [keep] if). Now look at your god to whom you remained clinging! (zalta is actually zalilta, but the 
firdt lam has been omitted in order to soften it), that is to say, [you remained] by his [your god’s] side, 
worshipping him. We will surely burn it, in fire, and then scatter [the ashes of] it into the waters, we 
will diverse it into the winds of the sea; and, after having slaughtered it, Moses did [exacftly] that which 
he has mentioned.

up therewith. And Adam disobeyed his Lord and so he erred, by [his] eating from the tree. Thereafter his Lord chose him. He brought him close [to Him], and relented to him. He ac¬ 
cepted his repentance, and guided him, that is, He guided him to seek repentance regularly.","We had already given a command to Adam before, but he forgot, and We found him lacking a firm resolve[43]. . When We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” they all prostrated, except Iblīs[44], who refused. . We said “O Adam, this is an enemy to you and to your wife, so do not let him drive you both out of Paradise, for then you will fall into misery. . Here you will neither go hungry nor naked, . nor will you suffer from thirst or from scorching heat.” . Then Satan whispered to him, and said, “O Adam, shall I show you the tree of immortality and a kingdom that will never decay?” . So they both ate from the tree, then their nakedness was revealed to each other, and they began to put together leaves from Paradise to cover themselves. Thus Adam disobeyed his Lord and fell into error[45]. . Thereafter his Lord chose him, accepted his repentance, and guided him.","[43] To resist the temptation of eating from the forbidden tree. . [44] See footnote 2:34. . [45] Unlike the Bible, the Qur’an does not put the blame on Eve for Adam’s sin, for which they were ousted from the Garden and sent down to the earth. See: (Genesis 3)."
20,123,127,"He said, ‘Go down both of you, that is, Adam and Eve, including all of your progeny, from it, 
from the Garden, all together, some of you, some of the progeny, being enemies of others, because of 
some wronging others. Yet if (the nun of the conditional particle in has been assimilated with the ma, 
which is extra) there should come to you guidance from Me, then whoever follows My guidance, the 
Qur’an, shall not go aStray, in this world, neither shall he be miserable, in the Hereafter. But whoever disregards My remembrance, [disregards] the Qur’an and does not believe in it, 
his shall be a Straitened life (read dankan with nunation, a verbal noun meaning ‘Straitened [circum¬ 
stances]’). This [Statement] has been interpreted in one hadith to mean the punishment of the grave for 
the disbeliever. And on the Day of Resurrection We shall bring him to the assembly, namely, the one who 
disregards the Qur’an, blind’, blind in eyesight. He shall say, My Lord, why have you brought be to the assembly blind, though I used to see?’.

and did not believe in them; and so, juSt as you forgot Our signs, today you will be forgotten’, abandoned 
in the Fire. And so, just as We requite him who disregards the Qur’an, We requite him who is prodigal, 
[him who] associates others with God, and believes not in the signs of his Lord. And the chastisement of 
the Hereafter is more terrible, than the chastisement of the life of this world and the punishment of the 
grave, and more enduring, longer lasting.","Allah said, “Get down, both of you, from here altogether [with Satan] as enemies to one another. Then when there comes to you guidance from Me, whoever follows My guidance will neither go astray nor fall into misery[46]. . But whoever turns away from My Reminder[47] will have a miserable life, and on the Day of Resurrection We will raise him blind.” . He will say, “My Lord, why have you raised me blind when I was able to see before?” . Allah will say, “Similarly Our verses came to you, but you ignored them, so you will be ignored Today.” . This is how We recompense those who transgress the limits and do not believe in the verses of his Lord; and the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe and more lasting[48].","[46] Neither go astray (in this life) nor fall into misery (in the Hereafter). . [47] i.e., the Qur’an. . [48] Than that of the worldly life."
20,128,132,"Is it not a guidance, has it not become clear, to them, to the disbelievers of Mecca, how many

the verb, as a way of preserving the [original] sense [of the Statement], is acceptable). Surely in that there 
are signs, lessons, for people of sense, for possessors of intellect. And but for a decree that had already preceded from your Lord, that their chastisement be de¬ 
ferred to the Hereafter, it, destruction, would have been an inevitability, [their destruction] would have 
been necessary in this world, and a Specified term, fixed for them ( ajalun musamman, a supplement to

other words, ‘ensconced in such [praise]’) before the rising of the sun, the morning prayer, and before its 
setting — the afternoon prayer — and in the watches of the night, [during] the hours thereof, and make 
glorifications, perform the sunset and the evening prayer, and at either side of the day ( wa-atrafa’l-

to go down, which is the [end] side of the firSt half [of the day] and the [Start] side of the second half [of 
the day]; that perhaps you may be pleased, with the reward that you will be given. And do not extend your glance toward what We have given to some pairs, [certain] categories, 
among them to enjoy, [as] the flower of the life of this world, its adornment and delight, that We may try 
them thereby, [to see] if they transgress [the bounds]. And your Lord’s provision, in Paradise, is better, 
than what they have been given in this world, and more enduring, longer lasting. And bid your family to prayer, and be Steadfast in [the maintenance of] it. We do not ask of 
you. We [do not] charge you with [the procurement of], any provision, [either] for yourself or for any¬ 
one else. We [it is Who] provide you, and the [beSt] sequel, Paradise, will be in favour of God-fearing, 
for such people.","Is it not yet clear to them how many generations We destroyed before them, in whose dwellings they still walk about? There are signs in this for people of sound intellect. .

So be patient with what they say, and glorify your Lord with praise before sunrise and before sunset, and glorify Him during the night and at both ends of the day, so that you may be pleased [with the reward]. . Do not turn your eyes covetously towards the various forms of splendor of this life that We have given some of the [disbelievers] to enjoy, as a trial for them. But the provision of your Lord is far better and more lasting. . Enjoin your household to perform prayer and adhere to it firmly. We ask no provision from you; rather, it is We Who give you provision. And the best outcome is for those who fear Allah.","[49] That He will not punish until the argument is established on them on the Day of Judgment.

the Statements, of what is in the former scriptures?, the tales contained in the Qur’an relating to paSt 
communities and [the details of] their destruction for denying the messengers? 

12 There are two ways of reading the Arabic here. One is to read it as, and but for a decree that had already preceded from your 
Lord, and a ^ecified term, it would have been an inevitability’, where the predicate in the Arabic word order has intervened be¬ 
tween the two subjects; or as, and but for a decree that had already preceded from your Lord, it would have been an inevitability 
and a Verified term’; cf. Baydawl, Anwar al-Tanzll, commentary to Q. 20:129.

Tafsir al-Jalalayn Had We destroyed them with a chastisement before him, before [the coming of] Muhammad 
(5) the Messenger, they would have said, on the Day of Resurrection: ‘Our Lord, if only You had sent us 
a messenger, so that we might have followed those signs of Yours, given to the messengers [to convey], 
before we were [thus] abased, at the Resurrection, and disgraced?’, in Hell. Say, to them: ‘Each, [one] of us and you, is waiting, to [see] what this affair will lead to. So wait! 
For you shall indeed know, at the Resurrection, who are the followers of the even path, the straight way, 
and who is [rightly] guided’, away from error, us or you.

If We had destroyed them with a punishment before this[52], they would have said, “Our Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger so that we would have followed Your verses before being humiliated and disgraced.” .

21,1,10,"Nigh has drawn for mankind, the people of Mecca, the deniers of the Resurrection, their reckon¬ 
ing, [on] the Day of Resurrection, yet they are heedless, of it, disregardful, of the preparation [required] 
for it by way of [embracing] faith. There does not come to them any new reminder from their Lord, [revealed] gradually, in other 
words, [new] words of the Qur’an, but they listen to it as they play, [as they] engage in mockery, with their hearts preoccupied, heedless of its meanings. And they are secret in [their] conference, 
[their] Speech, [they] the evildoers (alladhlna zalamu, a substitution for the [third person plural indica¬ 
tor] waw of wa-asarrul-najwa, and they are secret in conference) ‘Is this, namely, Muhammad (s), other 
than a [mortal] human being like yourselves?, and so what he produces is [mere] sorcery. Will you then 
take [to] sorcery, [will] you [succumb and] follow it, even though you are able to see?’, [even though] 
you know that it is sorcery? He said, to them, ‘My Lord knows the words, that are [SJroken], in the heavens and the earth, and 
He is the Hearer, of what they keep secret, the Knower’, of it. Nay ( bal, in the three instances [below] effects a transition from one subject to another) but 
they say, regarding those parts of the Qur’an he [the Prophet] has brought [to them] are: ‘A muddle of 
nightmares, a confusion [of things] he has seen in [his] sleep. Nay, he has fabricated it, he has invented 
it; nay, he is a poet, and what he has brought is [merely] poetry! So let him bring us a sign, such as was 
sent to the ancients’, like the she-camel [Salih], the Staff and the [glowing] hand [of Moses]. God, exalted 
be He, says: No town before them ever believed — meaning [none of] its inhabitants — of those that We de¬ 
stroyed, for the denial of the signs brought to them. Would they then believe? No. And We sent none before you other than men to whom We revealed (read nuhi or yuhd, ‘[to 
whom] it is revealed’) and [We sent] not any angels. Ask the People of the Remembrance, those with 
knowledge of the Torah and the GoSJjel, if you do not know, this; for they will know it. Since you are 
more likely to believe them than the believers are to believing Muhammad (s). And We did not make them, namely, the messengers, bodies that did not eat food, nay, they eat it; 
and they were not immortal, in this world. Then We fulfilled to them the promise, to deliver them. So We delivered them and whomever We 
would, [of] those who believed in them, and We destroyed the prodigal, those who denied them. Now We have sent down [as revelation] to you, O clan of Quraysh, a Book in which there is the 
remembrance that is yours, for it is in your language. Will you not understand?, and so believe in it?","The reckoning of the people has drawn near, yet they are turning away heedlessly. . Whenever new revelation comes to them from their Lord, they listen to it in jest, . with their hearts heedless. The wrongdoers whisper to one another in secret, “Is this but a human being just like yourselves? Will you then follow his magic, although you openly see?” . He said, “My Lord knows every word spoken in the heavens and earth, for He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.” . Yet they say, “This [Qur’an] is a set of jumbled dreams! Rather, he has fabricated it! Rather, he is a poet! So let him bring us a sign just as the earlier messengers were sent with[1].” . Not a single town We destroyed before them had believed[2]. Will they then believe? . We did not send before you [O Prophet] except men to whom We gave a revelation, so [O people] ask the People of the Scriptures if you do not know. . We did not give them bodies that needed no food[3], nor were they immortal. . Then We fulfilled Our promise to them: We saved them[4] and those whom We willed, and destroyed those who transgressed all bounds. . We have sent down to you [O people] a Book in which there is honor for you[5]. Do you not then understand?","[1] Such as the staff of Moses (عليه السلام), the camel of Salih (عليه السلام) and the like. . [2] Although they witnessed signs and miracles. . [3] Such as the angels. . [4] After they conveyed the message. . [5] As you have been mentioned and addressed in the Qur’an, or there is a reminder for you in it."
21,11,15,"And how many did We destroy of towns — meaning its inhabitants — that had been wrongdo¬ 
ing, disbelieving, and brought forth another people after it! And when they felt Our might, [when] the inhabitants of the town sensed destruction [to be 
near], behold, they ran away from it, they flee hastily [therefrom]. But the angels said to them scornfully: ‘Do not run [away]! Return to the opulence, the com¬ 
forts, which you were given to enjoy and your dwelling-places, that perhaps you might be asked’, for 
something of your worldly possessions as usual. 


Tafsir al-Jalalayn They said, ‘O (yd is for calling attention [to something]) woe to us!, [this is] our destruction! We 
have indeed been doing wrong’, through [our] disbelief. So that, saying, remained their cry, which they would make and repeat, until We made them as 
reaped [crops], as crops harvested with sickles when they were killed with the sword, stilled, dead, like 
the stillness of fire when it is extinguished.","[Imagine] how many towns of wrongdoers We have destroyed[6], and raised after them another people! . When they sensed Our punishment, they started running away from it. . “Do not run away, but return to your luxuries and dwellings[7], perhaps you will be questioned.” . They said, “Woe to us! We were indeed wrongdoers.” . They kept crying this out loud until We mowed them down, lifeless[8].","[6] i.e., who were persisting in wrongdoing. . [7] This is said to them in sarcasm and ridicule. . [8] i.e., extinguished like ashes."
21,16,20,"And We did not create the heaven and the earth and all that is between them, playing, being 
frivolous, but to indicate Our power and to benefit Our servants. Had We desired to find some diversion, that which provides diversion, in the way of a partner or 
a child, We would have found it with Ourselves, from among the beautiful-eyed houris or angels, were 
We to do [so]. But We did not do so, thus We never desired it. Nay, but We hurl. We caSt, the truth, faith, againSt falsehood, disbelief, and it obliterates it, and 
behold, it vanishes, disappears ( damaghahu, ‘it obliterates if, actually means ‘it struck the brain with a 
blow’, [a blow] which is fatal). And for you, O disbelievers of Mecca, there shall be woe, severe chastise¬ 
ment, for what you ascribe, to God, of mate or child. And to Him, exalted be He, belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth, as possessions, and 
those who are near Him, namely, the angels (wa-man ‘indahu, the subject, the predicate of which [is the 
following clause]) do not disdain to worship Him, nor do they weary. They glorify [Him] night and day, and they do not falter, in it, for it comes to them as [naturally 
as] breathing comes to us, [something] which we can never be diStraCted from.","We did not create the heavens and earth and all that is between them for fun. . If We had wished for a pastime[9], We could have had it from Our own, if We were to do so. . Rather, We hurl the truth at falsehood, and it crushes it[10], so it vanishes. Woe to you for what you falsely ascribe [to Allah][11]! . To Him belongs all those who are in the heavens and earth. Those [angels] who are with Him are not too proud to worship Him, nor do they ever grow weary. . They glorify Him day and night tirelessly.","[9] Such as a wife or a child. . [10] Lit. ""strikes its brain,"" disabling or killing it.

21,21,24,"Or (am, functions with the meaning of bal, ‘nay’, to effeCt a transition [in subjeCt-matter]; the 
hamza is for [rhetorical] denial) have they chosen gods, that are, from the earth, such as Stones, gold 
or silver, who, that is, gods [who], resurrect? who bring the dead back to life? No! Indeed only one who 
brings the dead back to life can be God. Had there been in [either of] them, that is, [in] the heavens and the earth, gods other than God, 
that is, other than Him, the two would have surely deteriorated, they [the heavens and the earth] would 
have deviated from their observed order, because counteractive forces would exiSt among such [gods], as 
is usually the case, when there is more than one ruler, that there is counteraction and a lack of consensus 
regarding something. So glory be to God — an exaltation — the Lord, the Creator, of the Throne, al- 
kursi, above what they ascribe, the disbelievers, to God, of His having a partner and otherwise. He shall not be questioned about what He does, but they shall be questioned, about their actions. Or have they chosen besides Him, exalted be He, other than Him, gods ? (herein is an interroga¬ 
tive meant as a rebuke). Say: ‘Bring your proof, for this — but such a thing is impossible. This is the 
Remembrance of those with me, namely, my community, and that [Remembrance] is the Qur’an, and 
the Remembrance of those before me, of communities, namely, the Torah and the Gospel and other 
Books of God, not a single one of which contains the statement that with God there exists another god, 
in the way that they claim — exalted be He above such a thing. Nay, but moSt of them do not know the 
truth, the affirmation of God’s Oneness, and so they are disregardful’, of that discernment that leads to 
[knowledge of] it.","Or have they taken gods from the earth who [cannot even] resurrect the dead? . If there had been gods besides Allah in the heavens and earth, both realms would have fallen in disorder. Glory be to Allah – Lord of the Throne – far above what they ascribe [to Him]. . He cannot be questioned for what He does, but they will be questioned. . Or have they taken other gods besides Him? Say, “Bring your proof. Here is the Book of those who are with me, and the Book of those who came before me[12].” Yet most of them do not know the truth, so they turn away.","[12] The Prophet (ﷺ) is addressed to challenge the pagans to produce their proof for the existence of other gods; whereas, the Qur’an, the Torah, and the Gospel are in agreement that there is no god but Allah alone."
21,25,29,"And We did not send any Messenger before you but We revealed to him (read niihi or yuha, ‘[but] 
it was revealed to him) that, ‘There is no god except Me, so worship Me’, that is, affirm My Oneness. And they say, ‘The Compassionate One has taken a son’, from the angels. Glory be to Him! Nay, 
but they are [merely] servants who are honoured, in His presence; for [the very] servitude [of all crea¬ 
tures to Him] is inconsistent with [the attribution of any of them as] progeny [of His]. They do not [venture to] Speak before Him — they only S]ieak after He has Spoken, and they ad

according to His command, that is, following [His issuing of] it. He knows what is before them and what is behind them, that is, what they have done and what 
they will do, and they do not intercede except for him with whom He is satisfied, that he be interceded 
for, and they, for awe of Him, exalted be He, are apprehensive, fearful. And should any of them say, ‘I am a god besides Him’, that is, [besides] God, in other words, [a 
god] other than Him — and this is Iblls, who summoned [others] to worship his soul and commanded 
that it be obeyed — such a one We will requite with Hell. Thus, in the same way that We requite him, We 
requite wrong-doers, idolaters.","“We never sent before you [O Prophet] any messenger without revealing to him that none has the right to be worshiped except Me, so worship Me.” . They say, “The Most Compassionate has begotten offspring!”[13] Glory be to Him! In fact, those [angels] are His honored slaves. . They do not speak before He speaks, and they only do as He commands. . He knows what is ahead of them and what is behind them[14]. They cannot intercede except for whom He pleases, and they are fearful in awe of Him. . If anyone of them were to say, “I am god besides Him,” We would punish him with Hell. This is how We punish the wrongdoers.",[13] The pagans claimed that angels are the daughters of Allah. . [14] See footnote 2:255.
21,30,35,"Have they not ([one may] read a-wa-lam or a-lam ) realised, [have they not] come to know, those 
who disbelieve, that the heavens and the earth were closed together and then We parted them. We made 
seven heavens and seven earths — or [it is meant] that the heaven was parted and began to rain, when 
it did not use to do so, and that the earth was parted and began to produce plants, when it did not use 
to do so; and We made, of water, [the water] that falls from the heaven and that firings from the earth, 
every living thing?, in the way of plants and otherwise: in other words, water is the cause of such [things] 
having life. Will they not then believe?, by affirming My Oneness? And We set in the earth firm mountains left it should shake with them, and We set in them, [in] 
the firm mountains, ravines, as roads ( subulan substitutes [for fijajan, ravines’, which are wide through- 
routes]), that perhaps they may be guided, to their destinations during travel. And We made the heaven a roof, for the earth, [functioning] like the roof of a house, preserved, 
from collapsing; and yet of the signs thereof, namely, [the signs of this heaven such as] the sun, the moon 
and the Stars, they are disregardful, failing to refled on them and thus realise that the Creator of such 
[things] can have no partner. And He it is Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon, each (kullun, the 
nunation of this [particle] Stands in place of the second noun [of the genitive conStrudion] that would 
have been al-shams, ‘the sun, or al-qamar, ‘the moon’, or their subsidiaries, namely, al-nujum, ‘the Stars’) 1 
in an orbit, a circular [one] like a mill in the sky, swimming, moving with S]ieed, like a swimmer in water. 
In order to effed the analogy with the latter, the plural person [of the verb employed] for rational beings 
is used. When the disbelievers said that Muhammad (s) would die, the following was revealed: And We 
did not assign to any human being before you immortality, permanence [of life] in this world. What, if 
you [are fated to] die, will they be immortal?, in it? No! (The laSt sentence constitutes the [syntadical] 
locus of the interrogative of denial). Every soul shall taile death, in this world, and We will try you. We will teSt you, with ill and 
good, such as poverty and wealth, sickness and health, as an ordeal (fitnatan, an objed denoting reason, 
in other words, for the purpose of seeing whether you will be patient and give thanks or not). And then 
unto Us you shall be brought back, that We may requite you.","Are the disbelievers not aware that the heavens and earth were joined together and then We split them apart? We created from water every living thing. Will they not then believe? . We have set on the earth firm mountains so it does not shake with them, and We have made therein broad pathways so that they may find their way. . And We have made the sky a well-protected canopy, yet they turn away from its signs[15]. . It is He Who created the night and the day, the sun and the moon – each floating in its orbit. . We did not grant immortality to any human being before you [O Prophet]. So if you die, will they live forever? . Every soul will taste death; We test you with bad and good as a trial, then to Us you will all be returned.",[15] Such as the sun and the moon.
21,36,41,"And whenever the disbelievers see you, they only take you in derision, that is, as one to be de¬ 
rided, saying: ‘Is this the one who mentions your gods?’, that is, [the one who] derides them? And yet 
when it comes to the mention of the Compassionate One, to them, they (hum, [repeated] for emphasis) 
are disbelieving, of it, saying, ‘We do not know of any such [individual]’. The following was revealed regarding their demand that chastisement be hastened: Man was 
created ofhafte, that is to say, because he is so haSty in his affairs, it is as if he had been created out of it. 
Assuredly I shall show you My signs. My promises of chastisement, so do not demand that I hasten, in 
[sending] it. And so He [God] made them suffer death at [the battle of] Badr.

Tafsir al-Jalalayn And they say, ‘When will this promise, of resurrection, be [fulfilled], if you are truthful?’, 
about it. [God] exalted be He, says: If those who disbelieved only knew of the time when they shall not [be 
able to] ward off, repel, the Fire from their faces, nor from their backs, nor shall they be helped, [nor] 
shall they be protected from it at the Resurrection (the re^Jionse to the [conditional particle] law, ‘if only] 
is [something along the lines of] ‘they would not have said that’). Nay, but it, the Resurrection, shall come upon them suddenly, dumbfounding them, confusing 
them, and they shall not be able to ward it off, nor shall they be granted any respite, [nor shall they] be 
given any [extra] time to make a repentance or offer an excuse. And verily messengers before you were derided — herein is a statement to comfort the Prophet 
(s) — but those who mocked them were encircled by, it was sent down [against them], that which they 
used to deride, namely, chastisement — likewise it shall befall those who have derided you.","When the disbelievers see you, they only take you in ridicule, [saying], “Is this the one who speaks ill of your gods?” while they reject even the mention of the Most Compassionate. . Man is created of haste. I will show you My signs, so do not ask Me to hasten them. . They say, “When will this promise come to pass, if you are truthful?” . If only the disbelievers knew the moment when they would be unable to ward the Fire off their faces or their backs, nor would they be helped[16]. . Rather, it will come upon them suddenly and stun them; they will not be able to avert it, nor will they be given respite. . Indeed, there were messengers before you who were ridiculed, but those who mocked them were encompassed by what they used to ridicule.","[16] The completion of the sentence is ""...they would not be asking for the punishment."""
21,42,44,"Say, to them: ‘Who can guard you, preserve you, by night and day from the Compassionate 
One?’, from His chastisement, if it should befall you? In other words, no one can do such a thing. Those 
being addressed [here] do not fear God’s chastisement because they deny [the truth of] it. 2 Nay, but of 
the Remembrance of their Lord, that is, the Qur’an, they are disregardful, failing to refled: on it. Or is it that they have (am, ‘or’, fundions with the sense of a hamza used to indicate denial, that 

is, [read it as] a-lahum, ‘do they have’) gods to defend them, againSt that which might cause them harm, 
besides Us? In other words, do they have anyone other than Us to defend them againSt such [things]? 
No! They, namely, the gods, cannot help themselves, and so they will not [be able to] help them; nor 
shall they, the disbelievers, be protected from Us, from Our chastisement (one may say sahibaka’Llahu, 
to mean ‘May God preserve and proted you’). Nay, but We provided [comforts] for these and their fathers, in the way of the graces which We 
beStowed on them, until life lasted long for them, so that they were deluded by such [longevity]. Do they 
not see how We visit the land, [how] We target their land, diminishing it at its edges?, by granting the 
Prophet vidory [through conqueSt]. Are they the ones who will prevail? No, it is rather the Prophet and 
his Companions [who will do so].","Say, “Who can protect you by night and by day against the Most Compassionate?” Yet they turn away from the admonition of their Lord. . Do they have gods who can defend them against Us? They cannot even help themselves, nor will they be protected from Us. . Nevertheless, We have provided for them and their forefathers luxuries which they enjoyed for a long time. Do they not see that We gradually reduce the land from its outlying sides?[17] Is it they who will then prevail?",[17] See footnote 13:41.
21,45,47,"Say, to them: 7 warn you only by the Revelation’, [that comes] from God, and not by my own

If a mere breath of your Lord’s torment were to touch them, they would surely say, “Woe to us! We were indeed wrongdoers.” .

Sufficient are We as Reckoners.","[18] i.e., as small or insignificant as a mustard seed."

Sura al-Anbiya And this, namely, the Qur’an, is a blessed Remembrance which We have revealed. Will you then 
deny it? (the interrogative here is intended as a rebuke).","We certainly gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion, shining light and admonition[19] for the righteous, . those who fear their Lord without seeing Him[20], and are apprehensive of the Hour. .

[21] i.e., pretending ignorance or refusing to acknowledge it?"
21,51,68,"And verily We had given Abraham his rectitude before, that is, his [right] guidance before he 
came of age — and We were Aware of him, in that he was deserving of such [guidance], when he said to his father and his people, ‘What are these images, [these] idols, to which you 
[constantly] cleave?’, that is, which you are constantly worshipping. They said, ‘We found our fathers worshipping them’, and so we followed their example. He said, to them, ‘Truly you and your fathers, by worshipping them, have been in manifest error’. They said, ‘Do you bring us the truth, in that which you are saying, or are you being frivolous?’, 
in this regard. He said, ‘Nay, but your Lord, the [only] One worthy of being worshipped, is the Lord, the 
Owner, of the heavens and the earth, [ the One] Who originated them, [Who] created them without any 
precedent, and to that, which I have said, I am a witness. And, by God, I shall devise [a Stratagem] againSt your idols after you have gone away, with 
your backs turned’. And so, after they had set off to a gathering of theirs on one of their festival days, he reduced them 
to fragments (read judhadhan or jidhadhan, meaning pieces’), [smashing them] with a hatchet, [all] 
except the principal one among them, around whose neck he hung the hatchet, that they might return 
to it, that is, to the principal one, and see what he had done to the others. They said, upon returning and seeing what had been done, ‘Who has done this to our gods? 
Truly he is an evildoer’, in this regard. They said, one to the other: ‘We heard a young man making [ill] mention of them, deriding 
them — he is called Abraham’. They said, ‘Then bring him before the people’s eyes, that is, openly, that they may testify’, againSt 
him as being the perpetrator. Tltey said, to him, after he had been brought [before them]: ‘So, is it you (read a-anta, [either] 
pronouncing fully the two hamzas; or substituting an alif for the second one, or not pronouncing it [the 
second one], and inserting an alif between the one not pronounced and the other one, or without [this 
insertion]) who has done this to our gods, O Abraham?’ He said, concealing his deed: ‘Rather it was this principal one among them did it. So question 
them, about the perpetrator of this, if they can Speak!’ (here the response to the conditional Statement 
precedes [the conditional clause]; in the preceding clause there is an intimation for them that an idol, 
acknowledged as being incapable of acftion, cannot be a god). So they turned [thinking] to themselves, in reflection, and they said, to themselves: ‘Truly it is 
you who are the evildoers’, for worshipping that which cannot SJieak. Hien they were turned, by God, on their heads, that is to say, they were made to return to their 
disbelief and said, ‘By God, you are certainly aware that these [idols] cannot Speak’, in other words, how 
can you thus command us to question them? He said, ‘Do you then worship, besides God, that is, in His place, that which cannot benefit you 
in any way, with regard to [granting you] provision and otherwise, nor harm you?, in any way if you 
were not to worship it?

that these idols are not worthy of being worshipped and are not fit for such [a purpose] — only God, 
exalted be He, is worthy of it. They said, ‘Burn him, that is, [burn] Abraham, and Hand by your gods, by having him burnt, 
if you are to do anything’, in the way of standing by them. Thus they gathered lots of firewood and lit a 
fire throughout it. They then tied up Abraham, placed him in a balliSta and had him hurled into the fire. 
God, exalted be He, says:","Indeed, We had given Abraham sound judgment before[22], for We know him well. . When he said to his father and his people, “What are these statues to which you are so devoted?” . They said, “We found our forefathers worshiping them.” .

He said, “Nay, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and earth, Who created them, and I am one of those who bear witness to it. . By Allah, I will surely plot against your idols after you have turned and gone away.” . So he broke them into pieces, except the biggest of them, so that they might come back to it. .

He said, “Rather, it was this biggest one who did it. So ask them, if they can speak!” . So they turned back to one another, and said, “Indeed, it is you who are the wrongdoers.” . Then they turned to their obstinacy[24], [saying], “You already know that they cannot speak.” . Abraham said, “Do you then worship besides Allah that which can neither benefit nor harm you in the least? . Fie upon you[25] and upon all that you worship besides Allah! Do you not have any sense?” . They said, “Burn him and avenge your gods if you must do something.”","[22] i.e., before Moses, or in his early youth. . [23] Or his confession about what he did. .

which he had been tied]. Its heat departed, but its luminosity remained. And by His words wa-saldman, 
and safety’, Abraham was safe from ( salima ) death because of its coolness. And they sought to outwit him, namely, by having him burnt, but We made them the greater 
losers, in what they sought. And We delivered him, as well as Lot — son of his [Abraham’s] brother Haran — from Iraq, [and 
brought them] to the land which We have blessed for all peoples, [blessed it] with an abundance of rivers 
and trees, and this is Syria. Abraham settled in Palestine, and Lot in the Sinful City ( al-mu’tafika, cf. Q. 
53:53); and between the two is [the distance of] a day’s journey. And We gave him, namely, Abraham — for he had asked for a child, as mentioned in [siirat] al- 
Saffat [Q. 37:100] — Isaac, and Jacob as a gift, that is, as [something] in addition to what was requested;

knowledge; and We delivered him from the town which had been committing, that is, whose inhabit¬

bird-games and other things. Truly they were a folk of evil [people] (saw’ is the verbal noun of saahu,

substituted by [the following, idh yahkumani ...]) when they gave judgement concerning the tillage, 
a field of crops or a vineyard, when the sheep of a [certain] people Strayed into it, that is, [when these 
sheep] grazed there at night, but without a shepherd, because they had escaped; and We were witnesses 
to their judgement ( li-hukmihim shahidina: here the plural person is being used in the case of a dual). 
David decreed: to the owner of the tillage belong the head of the sheep. Solomon decreed: he 6 shall ben¬ 
efit from [the use of] their milk, offering and wool until such time as the tillage is restored to its original 
State at the hands of the owner [of the sheep], after which he [the owner of the tillage] should return 
them [the sheep] to him [their owner]. And We gave understanding of this, that is, the judgement, to Solomon. [It is said that] both of 
their decisions were [the result of] independent judgement [exercised by both], and that David con¬ 
sulted Solomon; but it is also said [that their decisions were] by way of inspiration [from God] — the 
second [decision] abrogated the firSt. And to each, of the twain, We gave judgement, prophethood, and 
knowledge, in matters of religion. And We disposed the mountains to glorify [God] with David, and the 
birds also, were disposed to glorify [God] with him, for he [David] had commanded such [glorification 
on their part], so that whenever there was a lapse [on his part], he would [be reminded to] apply himself 
to the task [of glorifying God] promptly. And We were [certainly] doers, of this disposing of them to 
glorify [God] along with him, even if it should amaze you, that they should [be able to] respond to the 
lord David. And We taught him the art of making garments, namely, coats of mail — [which are called labus] 
because they are worn ( tulbas ). He was the firSt [human being] to make them; hitherto there were [only] 
plates [of armour] — for you, as well as all mankind, to protedyou (read nuhsinakum, [the subject being] 
‘God’; or yuhsinakum, [the subject being] ‘David’; or tuhsinakum, [the subject being] garments’) againSt 
your [mutual] violence, your wars againSt your enemies. Will you then, O people of Mecca, be thankful?, 
for My favours, by believing in the Messenger — in other words, be thankful to Me by [doing] this. And, We disposed, for Solomon the wind to blow Strongly — in another verse it is [described 
as being] rukhaan, ‘to blow softly’ [Q. 38:36]; in other words, [it is either] blowing violently or gently 
[respectively], according to what he [Solomon] wanted — making its way, at his command, to the land 
which We have blessed, namely, Syria; and We have knowledge of all things, among them the fad that 
God, exalted be He, knew that what He gave to Solomon would prompt him to be subservient to his 
Lord, and so God did this in accordance with His knowledge. And, We disposed, of the devils some that dived for him, plunging into the sea and bringing out 
of it jewels for Solomon, and performed tasks other than that, that is, other than diving, such as building 
and otherwise. And We were watchful over them, leSt they should Spoil what they had made, for when¬ 
ever they completed a task before nightfall, they would [invariably] Spoil it, unless they were occupied 
with some other [task].","And [remember] David and Solomon, when they passed judgment about the tillage into which some people’s sheep had strayed at night[31], and We were witnesses to their judgment. . We made Solomon understand it[32], although We gave each of them sound judgment and knowledge. We subjected the mountains and birds to glorify Allah along with David. It was We Who did all this. . And We taught him[33] the art of making coats of mail for you to protect yourselves in your battle. Will you then be grateful? . And to Solomon [We subjected] the raging wind, to blow by his command to the land We had blessed. It is We Who have full knowledge of everything. . And among the devils [We subjected] those who dived for him[34] and performed other duties. It is We Who were watching over them[35].","[31] Destroying the crops and eating therefrom. . [32] A man’s flock of sheep strayed into another man’s tillage. When the two men came to David for judgment, he ruled that the shepherd must give his sheep in compensation for the damage. Nonetheless, Solomon suggested that the sheep be kept with the owner of the tillage, so he may benefit from their milk and wool, while the shepherd should work on the land to restore it to its former state. Thus, the farmer would take back his tillage in perfect condition, and the sheep would be returned to its owner. David was impressed by his son’s insightful and fair judgment and approved it. . [33] i.e., David apart from Solomon. . [34] Bringing him pearls.

21,83,86,"And, mention, Job (Ayyuba, is substituted by [the following, idh nada rabbahu ...]) when he 
called out to his Lord — after he had been afflided with the loss of all of his possessions and children, 
the laceration of his body, his being shunned by all except his wife, for a period of thirteen, seventeen, 
or eighteen years, as well as [the affliction of enduring] a Straitened means of livelihood — ‘Indeed (read 
anni because of the implicit ya [of the firSt person pronoun]) harm, adversity, has befallen me, and You 
are the MoSt Merciful of the merciful’. So We responded to him, in his call, and removed the harm that had befallen him, and We gave 
him [back] his family, his male and female children, by bringing them back to life — of each sex there 
were three or seven 7 along with them [other children] the like of them, from his wife, for she was made 
younger. He had also possessed a threshing floor for wheat and another for barley, so God sent two 
clouds and one of them poured forth gold onto the wheat threshing floor and the other poured forth sil¬ 
ver onto the barley threshing floor, until they overflowed; as a mercy (rahmatan, a direCt objeCt denoting

and thus be rewarded [by God]. And, mention, Ishmael and Idris and Dhu’l-Kifl — all were of the patient, in [maintaining] 
obedience to God and staying away from acfts of disobedience to Him. And We admitted them into Our mercy, through [granting them] prophethood. Indeed they 
were among the worthy, of it. 8 Dhu 1 -Kifl was so called because he undertook (takaffala) 9 to fad: every 
day and day up every night in prayer, and to pass judgement between people without succumbing to 
anger, and fulfilled this [undertaking]. It is also said, however, that he was not a prophet. 10","And [remember] Job, when he cried out to his Lord, “I have been struck by adversity[36], and You are the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.” . So We responded to him and relieved his adversity, and We restored to him his family, twice as many, as a mercy from Us and as a reminder for Our worshipers. . And [remember] Ishmael, Idrīs and Dhul-Kifl[37]; they were all steadfast. . And We admitted them to Our mercy, for they were truly righteous.","[36] i.e., loss of health, wealth, and children. .

people, that is, furious with them because of what he had suffered at their hands — even though he had 
not been granted permission [by God to go off as he did] — thinking that We had no power over him, 
that is, that We could [not] compel him to [submit to] Our decree in the way that We did by imprisoning 
him inside the Stomach of the whale; or that We could [not] make circumstances difficult for him. Then 
he cried out in the darknesses, [through] the darkness of the night, the darkness of the sea and the dark¬ 
ness of the whale’s Stomach, that: ‘There is no god except You! Glory be to You! I have indeed been one 
of the wrongdoers’, for leaving my people without [Your] permission. So We responded to him and delivered him from the distress, by [means of] those words, and 
thus, in the same way that We delivered him, We deliver the believers, from their anguish when they call 
out to Us seeking succour.","And [remember] the Man of the Whale [i.e., Jonah] when he departed in anger[38], thinking that We would not take him to task. Then he cried out in the depths of darkness[39], “None has the right to be worshiped except You. Glory be to You! I have certainly done wrong”. .

inherit from me, and You are the be it of inheritors’, the One that endures after all of your creation has 
perished. So We responded to him, in his call, and gave him John, as a son, and We restored [fertility to] 
his wife for him, and so she bore a child, having been barren. Truly they, those prophets that have been 
mentioned, would hasten to, [they would] hurry [to perform], good works, [namely] acfts of obedience, 
and supplicate Us out of desire, for Our mercy, and in awe, of Our chastisement, and they were submis¬ 
sive before Us, humble in their worship.","And [remember] Zachariah, when he cried out to his Lord, “My Lord, do not leave me childless, for You are the Best of Inheritors.” .

selves, that is, they became divided in the matter of their religion, and at variance over it — these are the 
[different] secfts of the Jews and the Christians. God, exalted be He, says: All shall return to Us, and We 
will requite each according to his deeds. 

8 The term al-salihun means ‘the righteous’; but because the commentator has added the preposition li, it has acquired a transi¬ 
tive meaning, salih li, ‘fit for [something] In the Arabic, both senses are retained, and this is, of course, the commentator’s way of 
reinforcing his previous glossing of rahma as ‘prophethood’. 

9 Tire understanding here is that the prophet’s name derives from the Arabic root k-f-l, ‘to undertake’, ‘assume responsibility [for 
something] ’ etc. 

10 This prophet (also mentioned in Q. 38:48) may possibly be the same Ezekiel of the Old Testament; especially interesting in this 
reSpect is the correlation between the sense of ‘bearing a responsibility’ in the Arabic k-f-l root and God’s words to Ezekiel in the 
Old Testament: ‘So that you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel’ (Ezek. 4:4ff).

Sura al-Anbiya And whoever performs righteous deeds, being a believer — no rejection, that is, no denial, will 
there be of his endeavour, and We will indeed write it down for him, by commanding the guardian an¬ 
gels to record it and then We requite him for it. It is forbidden for any town, meaning [it is forbidden for] its people, which We have destroyed 
that they should (la yarjiuna: the la is extra) return, that is, their return to this world is prohibited.","Indeed, this religion of yours is one religion, and I am your Lord, so worship Me alone. . But people have divided themselves into sects, yet they will all return to Us. . Whoever does righteous deeds while he is a believer, his efforts will not be denied[40], for We are recording them all. . It is not possible for any town that We have destroyed to ever come back [to this world][41],","[40] i.e., He will not be deprived of his due reward. . [41] To repent to Allah."

never have] entered it, and they will all, both the worshippers and the worshipped, abide therein. For them, for the worshippers, there will be groaning therein and they will not hear in it, any¬

the following was revealed:","until when Gog and Magog are let loose, swarming swiftly from every mound, . when the True Promise[42] draws near, the eyes of those who disbelieved will stare in horror, [saying], “Woe to us!

from Us, and among such are those who have jus't been mentioned: they will be kept away from it. They will not hear the faintest sound from it and they will abide in what their souls desired, 
of bliss. The Supreme Terror — which is that a servant be ordered off to the Fire, shall not grieve them, 
and the angels shall receive them, upon their exiting from their graves, saying to them: ‘This is your day, 
the one which you were promised’, during the [life of the] world.","But those for whom We have decreed the finest reward, they will be far away from it. .

the lam [of li’l-kitdb ] has the sense of [the particle] ‘aid, ‘over’; a variant reading [for li’l-kitab] has the 
plural, li’l-kutub, ‘the books’). As We began the frit creation, from non-existence, We shall repeat it, 
after making it non-exiStent (the kdf[oika-md, ‘as’] is semantically connected to nuidu, ‘We shall repeat

at the ConqueSl of Mecca (Ibn al-Athir, Usd al-ghaba, in, 239-40). 

14 The particle ma is masdariyya because it is Standing in place of a verbal noun. So ka-md bada’na , ‘As We began, is in fact ka- 
bad’ind, ‘As [was] Our beginning’.

of God, after the Remembrance, meaning the Mother of the Book (umm al-kitdb), which is [kept] with 
God: ‘Indeed the land, the land of Paradise, shall be inherited by My righteous servants’ — [this prom¬ 
ise] applies to all righteous ones. Indeed there is in this, Qur’an, a proclamation, sufficient means for [securing] entry into Para¬ 
dise, for a people who are devout, aCting in accordance with [what is stipulated in] it.","On the Day when We roll up the heavens like a scroll of records. Just as We originated the first creation, so We will bring it back. That is Our binding promise, which We will surely do. .

being revealed to me with reSjieCt to the Divine is His Oneness. So will you submit?’, [will you] accede

of life are concluded (this [second] clause [wa-mataun, ‘and an enjoyment’] counters the former, which 
is the object of the optative expressed by [the particle] laalla, ‘perhaps’; the second [clause] cannot be 
an optative). Say ( qul, a variant reading has qdla, ‘He said’): ‘My Lord! Judge, between me and my deniers, 
with truth, by [assigning] chastisement for them or victory [for me] over them. And so they were chas¬

victory over them. And our Lord is the Compassionate One, Whose help is to be sought against what

[22] al-Hajj 


Medinese, except for verses 52, 53, 54 and 55, which were [revealed] between Mecca and Medina; it 
consists of 78 verses, revealed after [surat] al-Niir. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","We have not sent you [O Prophet] except as a mercy to the worlds. . Say, “It is only revealed to me that your God is only One God; will you then submit to Him? . But if they turn away, say, “I have proclaimed the message to you all alike[46], and I do not know whether what you are warned of[47] is near or far. . Indeed, He knows what is said openly and knows what you conceal. . I do not know; perhaps this [delay][48] is a test for you[49] and an enjoyment for a while.” . [The Prophet] said, “My Lord, judge [between us] in truth. Our Lord is the Most Compassionate Whose help is to be sought against what you describe[50].”","[46] i.e., We and you know that there is no peace between us.
 [47] i.e., the punishment. . [48] i.e., this postponement of punishment.
 [49] To increase sin. . [50] i.e., of lies and disbelief."
22,1,2,"0 mankind, that is, the inhabitants of Mecca and others: fear your Lord, that is, of His punish¬ 
ment, by being obedient to Him. Surely the earthquake of the Hour [of Doom], that is, the violent 
quaking of the earth after which the sun will rise from the weSt, [something] which will be near [the 
time of] the Hour, is a tremendous thing, in the way it will distress people — this itself being a sort of 
punishment. On the day when you behold it, every, actually, nursing female,' on account of this [tremendous 
day], will negleCl her suckling, that is, she will forget it; and every pregnant female will deliver her bur¬ 
den, and you will see mankind [ as though ] drunk, because of the severity of [their] fear, yet they will not 
be drunk, because of any drink; but God’s chastisement is severe, and so they will be terrified of it.","O people, fear your Lord; the earthquake of the Hour is something dreadful. . On the Day when you see it, every nursing mother will abandon her baby, and every pregnant woman will miscarry. You will see people as though they are drunk, while they are not drunk, but the punishment of Allah is severe.",
22,3,4,"The following was revealed regarding al-Nadr b. al-Harith and his companions: And among man¬ 
kind are those who dispute about God without any knowledge — they would say, ‘The angels are Gods 
daughters, and the Qur’an [a colledion of] the fables of the ancients’. In addition, they would deny resur¬ 
rection and the bringing back to life of those who had become dust — and [those who] follow, in their 
manner of diluting, every rebellious devil, about whom it has been decreed, in other words, it has been decreed with regards to a devil, that 
whoever takes him for a friend, that is, [whoever] follows him, he will make him go aStray and will lead 
him, summon him, to the chastisement of the Blaze, namely, to the Fire.","There are some people who dispute concerning Allah without knowledge, and they follow every rebellious devil. . It has been decreed that whoever takes him as an ally, he will misguide him and lead him to the punishment of the Blazing Fire.",
22,5,7,"O mankind, in other words, [O] people of Mecca, if you are in doubt about the Resurrection, 
then lo! [consider that] We have created you, that is, [We have created] your origin — Adam — from 
duSt then. We created his progeny, from a drop, a Sperm-drop, then from a clot, congealed blood, then 
from a [little] lump of flesh ( mudgha ), a piece of flesh, the size of what one would [be able to] chew 
( rnd yumdagh), partly formed, shaped, complete in form, and partly unformed, that is, uncomplete 
in form, that We may make clear to you, the perfecft nature of Our power, that you might [then] infer 
from this initial ad of creation, the [reality of its future] restoration. And We establish (nuqirru, marks a 
new [grammatically independent] sentence) in the wombs whatever We will for a Specified time, that is, 
until the time for it to come out, then We bring you forth, from the bellies of your mothers, as infants, 
and then. We extend your life, that you may come of age ( ashuddakum ), that is to say, [your] prime 
and Strength, which is [that age] between thirty and forty years. And there are some of you who are 
taken away, by death, before coming of age, and there are some of you who are relegated to the moSt 
abjeCl time of life, its moSt despicable [State] of decrepitude and senility, so that after [having had] some 
knowledge, he no longer knows anything — Tkrima said, ‘Whoever recites the Qur’an, such a State will 
not befall him’. And you see the earth torpid, barren, yet when We send down water upon it, it Stirs, it 
moves, and swells, it rises and grows, and grows [plants of] (anbatat min, min is extra) every delightful, 
fair, kind. Species. That, which is mentioned, from the commencement of man’s creation to the end of [the descrip¬ 
tion of] the earth being revived, is because God, He is the Truth, the Constant, the Permanent, and 
because He revives the dead and has power over all things; and because the Hour will come, whereof there is no doubt, uncertainty; and because God will 
resurrect those who are in the graves. 

1 The point of the gloss bi’l-fi’l is to make it clear that those who will be nursing then and there, and not those who may have nursed 
in the pad, will forget their sucklings — a way of portraying the awesome impad of the Hour. 


Tafsir al-Jalalayn","O people, if you are in doubt concerning the Resurrection, then We surely created you[1] from dust, then from a drop of sperm[2], then from a clot[3], then from a lump of flesh[4] – formed or unformed[5] – so that We may make it clear to you [Our power]. We settle in the wombs whatever We will for an appointed term. Then We bring you out as infants, then [We nurture you] so that you may reach your maturity. Then some of you die, while others are left to reach decrepit old age so that they may know nothing after having knowledge. You see the land lifeless, then as soon as We send down rain on it, it stirs and swells to life and brings forth every type of pleasant plant. . That is because Allah is the Truth; He alone gives life to the dead, and He is the Most Capable of all things. . The Hour is certainly coming; there is no doubt about it, and Allah will surely resurrect those who are in the graves.","[1] i.e., Your father, Adam. [2] Nutfah: zygote, which is resulted from the union of male and female gametes (sperm and egg).
 [3] ‘Alaqah: a clinging clot, which resembles a leech. [4] Mudghah: a chewed piece of meat.
 [5] i.e., formed ending into a healthy embryo, or defective ending in miscarriage."
22,8,13,"The following was revealed regarding Abu Jahl: And among mankind there are some who dispute 
about God without [any] knowledge or guidance, [being] with him, or an enlightening Scripture, one 
containing light, [being] with him, turning aside ( thaniya ‘itfihi, a circumstantial qualifier, meaning ‘turning his neck aside in disdain 
of belief; al-itf means ‘a side’, and can be either the left or the right) to go astray (read li-yadilla; or li- 
yudilla, ‘to lead [others] aStray’) from the way of God, that is, [from] His religion. For him there will be 
ignominy, chastisement, in this world — thus he [Abu Jahl] was slain on the day of Badr — and on the 
Day of Resurrection We shall make him taSte the chastisement of the burning, that is, [the chastisement 
of] being burnt in the Fire, and it shall be said to him: ‘That is [the chastisement] for what your hands have sent ahead, in other words, what you have 
offered [in the way of deeds] — He refers to him with reference to the two [hands] as opposed to other 
[parts], because moSt acftions are effected through them — and because God is not unjuSt to His serv¬ 
ants’, chaStising them without [their having committed] any sin. And among mankind there are those who worship God on a knife-edge: that is, with uncertainty 
in his worship — such [a person] has been likened the [knife-] edge of a mountain in his precariousness 
— if good [fortune] befalls him, [so that he enjoys] health and security with reSJieft to his own self and 
his property, he is reassured by it; but if an ordeal befalls him, a trial or ill-health with regard to himself 
or his property, he makes a turnabout, that is, he reverts to disbelief, losing both this world, when what 
he had hoped for in it has eluded him, and the Hereafter, by [his] disbelief. That is the manifest loss. He calls on, he worships, besides God, in the way of idols, that which could not hurt him, should 
he refrain from worshipping it, and that which could not profit him, if were to worship it. Such, a call, is 
extreme error, from the truth. He calls on him (the lam [of la-man] is extra) whose harm, when worshipped, is likelier than 
his benefit, even if he were to have any benefit, as he imagines [him to have]. Tridy an evil patron, is he, 
that is, [an evil] helper, and an evil friend, [an evil] companion is he. After the mention of‘the doubter’ 
and [his being in manifest] Toss’ [above, verse 11] there follows [the mention of] the believers and [their] 
reward, as follows:","There are some people who argue about Allah without knowledge, guidance or an enlightening scripture. . They turn their faces away [in arrogance] to lead people away from Allah’s way. For them there will be disgrace in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection We will make them taste the punishment of the burning fire. . “This is because of what your hands have sent forth, and Allah is not unjust to His slaves.” . There are some people who worship Allah on the edge [of faith][6]: if something good comes to them, they are content; but if they are afflicted with a trial, they turn back[7], thus losing both this world and the Hereafter. That is the evident loss. . They invoke besides Allah what can neither harm nor benefit them. That is the farthest misguidance. . They invoke those whose harm is more likely than their benefit. What a terrible protector and what a terrible associate!","[6] i.e., with uncertainty, hypocrisy, or heedlessness.
 [7] lit., they tumble on their faces, i.e., turn back to disbelief."
22,14,15,"Truly God shall admit those who believe and perform righteous deeds, in the way of obligatory 
and supererogatory acfts [of worship], into gardens underneath which rivers flow. Indeed God does 
whatever He desires, in the way of showing beneficence to those who obey Him and degrading those 
who disobey Him. Whoever supposes that God will not help him, namely, Muhammad (s) His Prophet, in this 
world and the Hereafter, let him extend a rope to the ceiling, [to] the roof of his house, fixing it there and 
[tying it] to his neck, and let him hang himself, that is, let him choke to death because of it, by severing 
his soul from [any existence on] the earth, as [reported] in the [various] Sahih compilations. 2 Then let 
him see whether his strategy, against the Prophet being helped, dispels that which enrages him, about it. 
In other words, let him choke to death with rage because of it, for it is inevitable. 3","Allah will surely admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to gardens under which rivers flow. Allah surely does what He wills. . Whoever thinks that Allah will never help His Prophet in this world and the Hereafter, let him stretch out a rope to the ceiling and strangle himself, then let him see if his effort can remove what enrages him[8].","[8] i.e., Allah will never stop supporting His Prophet (ﷺ), no matter what the disbelievers do."
22,16,18,"So, just as We revealed the previous verse, We revealed it, that is, the remainder of the Qur’an, as 
clear signs, manifest [signs] ( bayyindt, ‘clear signs’, is a circumstantial qualifier) and indeed God guides 
whomever He desires, that he be guided ( wa-anna’Llaha yahdi man yuridu, a supplement to the [suffixed

Sura al-Hajj 

Fire. Assuredly God, over all things, [the things] which they do, is Witness, Knowing them a knowledge 
of direCt vision (' ilm mushahada ). Have you not seen, [have you not] realised, that to God prostrate whoever is in the heavens and 
whoever is in the earth, together with the sun and the moon, and the Stars and the mountains, and the 
trees and the animals, that is, how they are submissive to Him in what He wills of them, as well as many 
of mankind?, namely, the believers, [who prostrate to Him] in addition to their submissiveness [to Him] 
when prostrating in prayer. And for many the chastisement has become due, and these are the disbeliev¬ 
ers, for they refuse to prostrate, [an aCtion] which is contingent on belief. And he whom God abases, 
[he whom] He makes unproSJierous, there is none to give him honour, [none] to make him fortunate. 
Indeed God does whatever He will, in the way of abasing or giving honour.","This is how We sent down this [Qur’an] as clear verses, and Allah guides whom He wills. . Indeed, those who believe, those who are Jews, the Sabians, the Christians, the Magians[9] and those who associate partners with Allah – Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection; Allah is Witness over all things. . Do you not see that to Allah prostrate[10] all those who are in the heavens and all those on earth: the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, the moving creatures, and many humans? But there are many to whom the punishment has become due[11]. Whoever Allah disgraces, none can honor him. Allah surely does what He wills.","[9] i.e., Zoroastrians; fire-worshippers. . [10] i.e., all things submit to Allah's Will.
 [11] Because they did not submit to Allah's Will."
22,19,22,"These twain are two contenders, that is, the believers constitute one contending party, and the 
five [categories of] disbelievers 4 constitute the other contending party (the term [khasm, contender’] 
may be used to refer to one or many) who contend concerning their Lord, that is to say, concerning His 
religion. As for those who disbelieve, garments of fire will be cut out for them, [garments] which they 
will wear — meaning that the Fire will encompass them — and boiling water will be poured over their 
heads, [hamim is] water that has reached an extreme temperature, whereby will be melted that which is in their bellies, of fats and otherwise, and, whereby will be 
grilled, their skins. And there will be hooked rods of iron for them, for their heads to be beaten with. Whenever they desire to exit from it, that is, [from] the Fire, on account of [their] anguish, 
they are made to return into it, they are driven back into it with the hooked rods, and, it shall be said 
to them: ‘TaSte the chastisement of the burning!’, namely, the one that has reached ultimate [degree of] 
combustion.","These are two opponents[12] who are in dispute about their Lord. As for the disbelievers, garments of Fire will be tailored for them, and scalding water will be poured over their heads, . melting all that is in their bellies and their skins. . And for [striking] them there will be maces of iron. . Every time, in their anguish, they try to get out of it, they will be forced back into it, “Taste the burning punishment!”","[12] i.e., the believers and the disbelievers."
22,23,24,"And He [God] says of the believers: Indeed God shall admit those who believe and perform right¬ 
eous deeds into gardens underneath which rivers flow; adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearl

or read wa-luluan, accusative, as a supplement to the [syntactical] locus of min asawira, ‘bracelets’); 5 and 
their raiment therein will be silk, namely, the one forbidden for men to wear in this world. And they shall be guided, in this world, to wholesome words, namely, ‘There is no god except 
God’, and they shall be guided to the path of the Praised, that is, to the praiseworthy way of God and 
His religion.","Allah will surely admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to gardens under which rivers flow.

prostrate ([ al-rukka and al-sujud ] are the plural forms of raki and sajid [receptively]), those praying. And announce, call out, among the people the [season for] Pilgrimage. Thus he cried out from

to him [thus]: At Your service, our Lord, [we are] at Your service’ ( labbayka’Lldhumma labbayk). The 
response to the command [clause] is [the following]: and they shall come to you on foot, walking ( rijal, 
plural of rajil, similar [in pattern] to qaim, ‘standing’, and [its plural] qiyam) and, riding, on every lean

in the way of offerings and sacrifices, and perform the circumambulation, the circumambulation fol¬

prohibition is of that which has died and so on. So avoid the abomination of idols ( mina’l-awthan: min 
here is explicative [as opposed to partitive], in other words, ‘[avoid abomination], namely, idols’), and 
avoid false speech, that is to say, ascribing partners to God in your [uttering of the] talbiya, or [avoid] 
bearing false witness; being hanifs to God, [being] of those who have submitted [to God], inclining away from every re¬ 
ligion except His religion, not ascribing partners to Him (this [clause] emphasises the preceding one, both 
[clauses] being circumftantial qualifiers referring to the [third person plural indicator] waw [of ijtanibu, 
‘avoid’]). For whoever ascribes partners to God, it is as though he had fallen from the heaven and been 
snatched away by [vulture] birds, that is, [as though] they had seized him swiftly, or [as though] the wind 
had blown him, dropped him, into a far-off place, so that there is no hope of his being saved. That ( dhalika, an implied subject, al-amru, ‘the matter [is]’, is taken to precede this [predicate]). 
And whoever venerates the sacraments of God, then that, in other words, then that veneration of them 
— namely, [of] the beafts of sacrifice offered in the Sandtuary, after the beft of them have been selected 
and fattened — derives from the piety of the hearts, of those individuals. These [sacraments] are called 
sha’air because they are marked out [ ish’ar ] with something to indicate that they are offerings, such as 
having a hump pierced with a piece of metal. 

7 See above Q. 2:196 n. 18. 

8 The expression muSlahabb is a technical legal term, denoting practice which is ‘recommended’ on account of the reward which 
the person is assumed to acquire as a result of such an action. This same category is sometimes alternatively qualified as sunna, 
‘[good] custom’ or mandub, ‘encouraged’; see Schacht, Introduction, 121.

Sura al-Hajj You may benefit from them, such as riding on them and carrying your loads on them in a way 
that does not harm them, until a specified time, the time for its immolation. Thereafter its lawful sac¬ 
rifice, that is, the site where its immolation becomes due, is by the Ancient House, meaning, the entire 
[Meccan] SanCtuary. And for every community, that is, [for every] believing group that came before you, We have 
appointed a [holy] rite (read mansakan as the verbal noun [ritual’], or mansikan as a noun denoting 
the site [for a rite]) in other words, [for every community We have appointed] a sacrificial slaughter or 
the site for such [a ritual], that they might mention God’s Name over the livestock that He has provided 
them, at the point of slaughtering them. For your God is One God, so submit, yield, to Him. And give 
good tidings to the humbly obedient, who, when God is mentioned, their hearts tremble, fear, and who endure [patiently] whatever 
may befall them, of ordeals, and who observe prayer, at its appointed times, and who, from that which 
We have provided them, expend, [from it] give voluntary alms. And [as for] the sacrificial camels (al-budn, plural of badana, which are camels’) — We have 
appointed them for you as one of God’s sacraments, the [ritual] ceremonies of His religion. There is 
good for you in them, benefit for you in this world, as already mentioned, and a reward in the Hereafter. 
So mention God’s Name over them, at the point of immolating them, when they are lined up, standing 
on three legs, with the left foreleg hobbled. Then, when their flanks have collapsed, fallen to the ground 
after immolation — which is the time when one may eat of them — eat of them, if you wish, and feed 
the [self-contained] beggar (al-qam, [a beggar] who is content with what he is given, neither asking nor 
approaching [people]) and the suppliant (al-mutarr, [a beggar] who asks [for charity] or approaches 
[people for that purpose]). So, that is, similar to such a disposal, We have disposed them for you, that it 
maybe immolated or ridden — for otherwise it would not have been possible — that perhaps you might 
be thankful, for My graces to you. Neither their flesh nor their blood shall reach God, that is, neither of these shall be raised up to 
Him; rather it is your piety that shall reach Him, that is, it is your righteous aCtion, performed purely 
for Him, together with [your] faith, that shall be raised up to Him. Thus has He disposed them for you, 
that you may magnify God for His guiding you, for His pointing out to you the [ritual] ceremonies of 
His religion and the rites of His pilgrimage. And give good tidings to the virtuous, namely, those who 
affirm the Oneness [of God].","Such [is the pilgrimage]; whoever honors the sacred rituals of Allah, it is best for him with his Lord. All sacrificial animals have been made lawful for you except what is recited to you[19]. So shun the impurity of idolatry and shun the words of falsehood. . Be exclusively devoted to Allah, associating no partners with Him. Whoever associates partners with Allah, it is as if he has fallen from the sky and has been snatched away by birds or swept away by the wind to a far-off place. . This is so. And whoever honors the rituals of Allah, it is from the piety of the hearts. . There are benefits for you in these [sacrificial animals] for an appointed term[20], then their place of sacrifice is near the Ancient House[21]. . For every community We ordained rites of sacrifice[22] so that they may mention the name of Allah over the sacrificial animals that He has provided for them. Your God is One God, so submit to Him alone, and give glad tidings to the humble, . those whose hearts are filled with awe when Allah is mentioned, and those who patiently endure whatever may befall them, and who establish prayer and spend out of what We have provided for them. . We have ordained the sacrificial camels [and cattle] among the rituals of Allah, in which there is much good for you. So mention the name of Allah over them when they are lined up, then when they fall down on their sides, eat of them and feed those [poor] who do not beg and those who do. Thus We have made them subservient to you, so that you may be grateful. . It is neither their flesh nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is your piety that reaches Him. This is how He has subjected them to you, so that you may proclaim Allah’s greatness for having guided you. And give glad tidings to those who do good.","[19] See 5:3. . [20] Such as milking and riding them until the time of sacrifice.
 [21] i.e., within the precincts of the Haram, which includes Mina. . [22] Rites of sacrifice have always been part of Allah's religion."
22,38,41,"Indeed God protests those who believe, against the [ruinous] misguidance of idolaters. Indeed 
God does not love the treacherous, with regard to what is entrusted to him, the ungrateful, for His grace 
— these are the idolaters —in other words, He will punish them. Permission is granted to those who fight, namely, to the believers, to fight back — this was the 
fi rSt verse to be revealed regarding the struggle [in the way of God] (jihad), because they have been 
wronged, as a result of the wrong done to them by the disbelievers. And God is truly able to help them; they are, those who were expelled from their homes without right, for their expulsion; they were 
expelled, only because they said, that is, because of their saying: ‘Our Lord is God’, alone: such a saying 
is right’, and so then to be expelled for [saying] it is to be expelled without right. Were it not for God’s 
causing some people (badahum, ‘some’, substitutes for al-ndsa, ‘people’) to drive back others, destruc¬ 
tion would have befallen (read la-huddimat to emphasise a great number [of destructions]; or read la- 
hudimat) the monasteries, (sawamij is for monks, and churches, ( kanais ) are for Christians, and syna¬ 
gogues, (salawdt ) is the Hebrew term for Jewish houses of worship (kanais), and mosques, (masajid) 
are for Muslims, in which, that is, in which mentioned places, God’s Name is mentioned greatly, and 
with such destruction aCts of worship cease. Assuredly God will help those who help Him, that is, [who] 
help His religion. God is truly Strong, overpowering His creation, Mighty, Invincible in terms of His 
dominion and power;

the conditional clause, which together with the response constitute a relative clause of the relative noun 
[‘those who’]; hum, ‘they [are]’, may be taken as the implied subject before this). 9 And with God reSls the 
outcome of all matters, in other words, to Him these [matters] return in the Hereafter.","Indeed, Allah defends those who believe, and Allah does not like every treacherous and ungrateful. . Permission [to fight] is given to those who are attacked[23] because they were oppressed, and Allah is indeed Most Capable of granting them victory, . those who have been driven out of their homes for no reason other than they say, “Our Lord is Allah.” If Allah were not to repel some people by means of others, there would have been demolished monasteries, churches, synagogues and mosques wherein the name of Allah is often mentioned. Allah surely helps those who stand up for His cause. Indeed, Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty. . It is those who, if We give them power in the land, they establish prayer and give zakah, and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong. And to Allah belongs the outcome of all matters.",[23] it is referring to the Prophet's Companions.
22,42,46,"And if they deny you — these [words] to the end [of the Statement] are meant to comfort the 
Prophet (s) — the people of Noah denied before them ( kadhdhabat, in the feminine person on the basis 
of the [overall] import), 10 and c Ad, the people of Hud, and Thamud, the people of Salih, as well as the people of Abraham, and the people of Lot, a,t d the inhabitants ofMidian, the people of Shu'ayb, and Moses was also denied: he was de¬ 
nied by the [native] Egyptians ( al-qibt ), and not by his people, the Children of Israel. In other words, 
[all of] those [people] denied their messengers, so take them [these messengers] as a good example [of 
constancy]. And I granted the disbelievers respite, I postponed [dealing with] them by deferring their 
requital, then I seized them, with chastisement, and how [terrible] was My abhorrence! ( nakir ), that is 
to say, My rebuke ( inkar ) of them for their denial, by My destroying them (the interrogative is meant as 
an affirmative, in other words,: it [My chastisement] was well-placed). How many a town I have destroyed ( ahlaktuha, a variant reading has ahlakndha, ‘We have de¬ 
stroyed’), while it was doing wrong, that is, while its inhabitants were [doing wrong] by being disbeliev¬ 
ers, but now it lies fallen down, collapsed, on its roofs and, how many, a neglected well, abandoned be¬ 
cause of the death of its owners, and a lofty palace. Stands empty because of the death of its residents. Have they, namely, the disbelievers of Mecca, not travelled in the land so that they may have 
hearts with which to comprehend, what befell deniers before them, or ears with which to hear?, the 
Stories of how they were destroyed and their dwelling-places were ruined, and so take heed? Indeed it is 
not the eyes that turn blind, but it is the hearts that turn blind within the breaSls (allati ffl-sudur, for 
emphasis).","If they reject you [O Prophet], the people of Noah, ‘Ād and Thamūd before them also rejected [their prophets], . as did the people of Abraham and the people of Lot, . and the people of Midian. And Moses was [also] rejected. But I gave respite to the disbelievers, then I seized them. How severe was My response! . How many towns We have destroyed for their persistent wrongdoing, leaving them in total ruin[24]; their wells abandoned and their lofty palaces deserted! . Have they not traveled through the land so that their hearts might understand and their ears might listen? It is not the eyes that turn blind, but it is the hearts within the breasts that turn blind.","[24] Lit., ""fallen upon its roofs,"" i.e., after the roofs of their buildings had caved in, the walls collapsed over them."
22,47,48,"And they ask you to hasten the chastisement, even though God would never break His promise, 
of sending down the chastisement [upon them] — and so He sent it down on the day of Badr. And truly 
a day with your Lord, of the days of the Hereafter, on account of the [severity of the] chastisement, is like 
a thousand years of your counting (read ta’udduna, or ya’udduna, ‘their counting’), in this world. To how many a town did I give respite while it was doing wrong; [but] then I seized it, meaning, 
[I seized] its inhabitants, and with Me lies the journey’s end, the [final] return.","They ask you to hasten the punishment, but Allah will not fail in His promise. A single day with your Lord is like one thousand years by your count. . How many towns did I give respite when they were wrongdoers, and then I seized them. And to Me is the final return.",

warning is plain; but also I am a giver of good tidings to the believers. And so those who believe and perform righteous deeds —for them there shall be forgiveness, of 
their sins, and a glorious provision, namely, Paradise. But those who Strive againSt Our signs, namely, the Qur’an, in order to invalidate them, seeking 
to incapacitate ( mu’ajjizina) those who follow the Prophet ([this meaning of mu’ajjizina ] being derived 
from their assumption that these [followers] are incapable individuals) and impeding them from [prac¬ 
tising their] faith; or [mu’ajjizina means] supposing Us to be incapable against them (a variant reading 
[of mu’ajjizina ] has mu’djizina, meaning, contending with Us’) that is to say, they suppose that they 
will [be able to] elude Us by denying resurrection and requital — those, they shall be the inhabitants of 
hell-fire. 

9 In other words, the verse actually reads as ‘they are those who ...’. 

10 Although the term qawm is usually masculine, the main verb is governed by the predominant import, which is the tribes (‘Ad 
and Thamud). As the names of tribes in Arabic are feminine, the genitive construction qawmu Niihin functions as an epithet, the 
name of the tribe, in order to concord with the remainder of the sentence.

Sura al-Hajj","Say, “O people, I am only sent to you as a clear warner. . Those who believe and do righteous deeds will have forgiveness and a generous provision. . But those who strive to discredit Our verses[25], they are the people of the Blazing Fire.”",[25] In order to defeat the Prophet (ﷺ).
22,52,57,"And We did not send before you any messenger ( rasul ) — this is a prophet who has been com¬ 
manded to deliver a Message — or prophet ( nabi ) — one who has not been commanded to deliver 
anything — but that when he recited [the scripture] Satan caSl into his recitation, what is not from the 
Qur’an, but which those to whom he [the prophet] had been sent would find pleasing."" The Prophet (s) 
had, during an assembly of the [men of] Quraysh, after reciting the [following verses from] surat al-Na- 
jm. Have you considered Lat and ‘Uzzd? And Manat, the third one? [5 3:19-20] added, as a result of Satan 
casting them onto his tongue without his [the Prophet’s] being aware of it, [the following words]: ‘those 
are the high-flying cranes ( al-ghardniq al-'ula) and indeed their intercession is to be hoped for’, and so 
they [the men of Quraysh] were thereby delighted. Gabriel, however, later informed him [the Prophet] 
of this that Satan had ca£t onto his tongue and he was grieved by it; but was [subsequently] comforted 
with this following verse that he might be reassured [of God’s pleasure]: thereat God abrogates, nullifies, 
whatever Satan had caSt, then God confirms His revelations. And God is Knower, of Satan’s casting of 
that which has been mentioned, Wise, in His enabling him [Satan] to do such things, for He does what¬ 
ever He will. That He may make what Satan has caSt a trial, a te£t ,for those in whose hearts is a sickness, dis¬ 
sension and hypocrisy, and those whose hearts are hardened, namely, the idolaters, [hardened] against 
acceptance of the truth. For truly the evildoers, the disbelievers, are [steeped] in extreme defiance, [in] 
a protracted feud with the Prophet (s) and the believers, for his tongue uttered mention of their gods in 
a way that pleased them, and yet this was later nullified. And that those who have been given knowledge, [of] God’s Oneness and the Qur’an, may know 
that it, the Qur’an, is the truth from your Lord, so that they may believe therein, and their hearts may 
find reassurance in it. And assuredly God guides those who believe to a Straight path, [a straight] route, 
namely, the religion of Islam. And those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt of it, that is, the Qur’an — because of 
what Satan had cait onto the tongue of the Prophet (s) and what had thereafter been nullified — until 
the Hour comes upon them unawares, that is, the Hour of their death or [of] resurrection, [comes upon 
them] suddenly, or there come upon them the chastisement of a day of desolation (’aqim), namely, the 
day of Badr, which held nothing of good for disbelievers, much like a sterile wind (rih ‘aqim) that bears 
no good; or it means, the Day of Resurrection, [referred to as ‘desolate’] because thereafter there will be 
no more night. 12 Sovereignty on that day, namely, on the Day of Resurrection, will be God’s, alone (the [sense of 
God’s] consolidation [of sovereignty on that Day] suggested by the clause renders the adverbial qualifier 
[yawma’idhin, ‘on that day’] into [accusative] dependent status). He will judge between them, between 
believers and disbelievers in the way that He explains next: Then those who believed and performed 
righteous deeds will be in Gardens of Bliss, as a bounty from God, while those who disbelieved and denied Our signs, for them will be a humiliating chastisement, 

a severe [one], because of their disbelief. 


11 There has been much disagreement between Muslim commentators on the proper interpretation of this verse. The problem 
centres on the thorny issue of whether the Prophet could have succumbed to insinuations from Satan (so that the expression 
tamarind means, ‘he wished for’, or ‘he entertained a thought’); or whether as God’s Messenger the Prophet’s ‘isma (‘immunity from 
error’) would have precluded the possibility of any Satanic intervention in the recital of the Qur’anic revelations (here tamanna is 
understood as meaning ‘to read’ — and this sense, however seemingly divorced morphologically from any roots relating to read¬ 
ing, reciting etc., is actually attested as meaning ‘to read’ in a famous line of poetry in the Lisdn, s.v. m-n-y). A good summary of 
the various opinions of Muslim exegetes on this verse can be found in the tafsir of Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, Mafatih al-ghayb, xn, 43ff. 
(commentary to Q. 22:52). Manuscript collation is important in such cases, for at leaSt in one edition of the Tafsir al-Jalalayn (eds. 
Abu ‘Abya, Swar and al-‘Ani, Dar al-Kitab al-'Arabi: Beirut, 1987) the commentary assumes the usual understanding of tamanna, 
‘to wish’ (p. 406), so that in this mentioned edition the section (including the remaining glosses) reads as follows: “but that when he 
wished, that his community become believers, Satan caSt into, the path of, his wish, obstacles and set up between him and what he 
sought hurdles. Thereat God abrogates, He erases and removes it from the hearts ofhis friends ( awliyd “), whatever Satan had cast, 
then God confirms His revelations, by making these [revelations] acceptable to those for whom the [promise of the] beSt reward 
( al-husna) had already gone forth and [those] who have secured the loftieSt Station. And God is Knower, of Satan’s casting of that 
which has been mentioned. Wise, in His enabling him [Satan] to do such things, for He does whatever He will.” 

12 In other words, it is a ‘barren day because in contrast to the usual day which gives birth to the night, this one will ‘bear’ nothing. 


313 


Tafsir al-Jalalayn","We did not send any messenger or prophet before you except that when he recited, Satan would cast into it [some misunderstanding]. But Allah would abolish what Satan casts, then Allah would confirm His verses[26], for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. . [That is] so that He may make what Satan casts a trial for those [hypocrites] whose hearts are sick[27] and those [disbelievers] whose hearts are hardened, for indeed the wrongdoers are in extreme dissension. . And so that those who were given knowledge may know that this [Qur’an] is the truth from your Lord, so they may believe in it and their hearts may become humbled to it. Allah surely guides those who believe to the straight path. . Yet the disbelievers will persist in doubt about it until the Hour comes upon them suddenly or there comes upon them the punishment of a barren Day[28]. . The sovereignty on that Day belongs to Allah[29]; He will judge between them, then those who believed and did righteous deeds will be in the Gardens of Bliss. . But those who disbelieve and reject Our verses, for them there will be a humiliating punishment.","[26] By clarifying those misunderstood issues, thus removing thereby any doubt. . [27] See footnote 2:10. . [28] The Day of Resurrection is described here as ‘aqīm (barren), for it will terminate all forms of life on earth and no new day will be born thereafter. .

22,58,66,"And those who emigrated in the way of God, that is, in obedience to Him, from [emigrating 
from] Mecca to Medina, and then were slain, or died, God shall provide them with a good provision, 
namely, the provision of Paradise. Tridy God is the bed of providers, the mo£t excellent of givers. Assuredly He will admit them into a place (read mudkhalan or madkhalan, [receptively] signi¬ 
fying the means of entry, or the place [entered]) that is pleasing to them, and that is Paradise. And truly 
God is Knowing, of their intentions, Forbearing, in refraining from punishing them. That, which We have related to you, [is so]. And whoever retaliates, [whoever] from among the 
believers requites, with the like of what he was made to suffer, at the hands of the idolaters wrongfully: 
that is whoever fights against them if they fight against him during the sacred month, and then is [again] 
made to suffer aggression, by them, that is to say, he is [again] wronged, by being expelled from his 
house, God will surely help him. Indeed God is Pardoning, to believers, Forgiving, them their engaging 
in combat during the sacred month. That, help, is because God makes the night pass into the day and makes the day pass into the 
night, that is to say, He makes each enter into the other by increasing the one [and decreasing the other], 
which is a sign of His power, exalted be He, [the same power] that produces [His] help, and because 
God is Hearer, of the supplications of believers. Seer, of them, giving them faith and re^onding to their 
supplications. That, help, also, is because God, He is the Truth, the Established [Truth], and what they call on 
( yad’una; also read tad’una, ‘you call on), [what] they worship, besides Him, namely, idols, that is the 
False, the transient, and because God, He is the High, the One [supreme] above all things in His power, 
the Great, besides Whom all things are insignificant. Have you not seen, realised, that God sends down water, rain, from the heaven whereupon the 
earth turns green, with plants — and this [too] is a sign of His power. Indeed God is Subtle, in dealing 
with His servants, when He brings forth plants through water, Aware, of what is in their hearts when the 
rain is delayed. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, in terms of ownership. 
Surely God, He is Independent, of His servants, Praiseworthy, to His friends. Have you not seen, realised, that God has disposed for you all that is in the earth, of beasts, and 
[that] the ships run upon the sea, for transport and to carry loads, by His command, by His leave, and 
He holds back the heaven left it should fall on the earth, save [ when it may do so ] by His leave, and you 
are destroyed. Surely God is, with mankind, Gentle, Merciful, in disposing [things for them] and hold¬ 
ing [others] back [from them]. And He it is Who gave you life, by originating you, then He will cause you to die, upon the con¬ 
clusion of your terms [of life], then He will give you life [again], at the Resurrection. Truly man, that is, 
[truly] the idolater, is very ungrateful, for God’s graces by neglecting to affirm His Oneness.","As for those who emigrate in the cause of Allah and are killed or died, Allah will surely give them a goodly provision. Indeed, Allah is the Best of Providers. . He will surely admit them to a place that they will be pleased with, and Allah is surely All-Knowing, Most Forbearing. . That is[30] so. Whoever retaliates against an aggressive act with its like and is wronged again, Allah will surely help him. Indeed, Allah is Ever-Pardoning, All-Forgiving[31]. . That is[32] because it is Allah Who causes the night to merge into the day, and causes the day to merge into the night. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing. . That is[33] because it is Allah Who is the Truth and whatever they invoke besides Him is falsehood, and it is Allah Who is the Most High, the Most Great. . Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky whereupon the earth becomes green? Indeed, Allah is Most Subtle, All-Aware[34]. . To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth, and indeed it is Allah Who is the Self-Sufficient, the Praiseworthy. . Do you not see that Allah has subjected to you all that is on the earth and the ships that sail through the sea by His command? He holds the sky from falling down on the earth except by His permission. Indeed, Allah is Ever Gracious and Most Merciful to people. . It is He Who gave you life, then will cause you to die, then He will bring you back to life. Indeed, man is ever ungrateful.","[30] i.e., Allah's admitting of the Companions into Paradise.
 [31] In spite of His ability to take revenge, the verse contains a suggestion that the believers pardon and forgive as well. . [32] i.e., Allah's capability to give assistance or victory to the oppressed. . [33] i.e., Allah's merging of the night into the day and the day into the night. .

other said. Do you not know (the interrogative here is meant as an affirmative) that God knows all that is in 
the heaven and the earth? Truly that, which has been mentioned, is [recorded] in a Book, namely, the 
Preserved Tablet ( al-lawh al-mahfuz). Indeed that, namely, the knowledge of what has been mentioned, 
is easy for God. And they, the idolaters, worship besides God that, namely, idols, for which He has never revealed 
any warrant, [any] definitive proof, and that of which they have no knowledge, [when they claim] that 
these are gods. And those who do evil, by way of [practising] idolatry, shall have no helper, to protect 
them against God’s chastisement. And when Our signs, in the Qur’an, are recited to them, [though they are] clear, manifest, signs 
(bayyinatin, a circumstantial qualifier) you perceive on the faces of those who disbelieve denial, that is to 
say, denial of these [signs], in other words [you perceive] the effect of such [denial] in the way of aversion 
and frowning. They woidd almost pounce upon those who recite Our signs to them, that is, [they would 
almoSt] fall upon them in assault. Say: ‘Shall I inform you about something worse than that?, something 
more repulsive to you than the Qur’an that is being recited to you? It is, The Fire! God has promised it to 
the disbelievers, in that their journey’s end shall be to it. And it is an evil journey’s end!’","For every community We ordained ways[35] of worship which they follow, so do not let them dispute with you [O Prophet] in this matter. But call them to your Lord, for you are indeed on the straight guidance. . And if they argue with you, say, “Allah knows best what you are doing.” . Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which you used to differ. . Do you not know that Allah knows all that is in heaven and on earth?

Allah has promised it to those who disbelieve; what a terrible destination!","[35] All prophets came with the same message of worshiping only One God, doing good and shunning evil; nonetheless, each faith-community had their own law. . [36] i.e., the Preserved Tablet (al-Lawh al-Mahfūz). . [37] i.e., worse than the rage you feel against the believers who recite Allah's verses or your threats against them."
22,73,76,"O mankind, that is to say, [O] people of Mecca, a similitude is being struck, so listen to it, and 
it is that: truly those on whom you call, [whom] you worship, besides God, that is, other than Him, and 
these are the idols, will never create a fly ( dhubab is a generic noun, the singular of which is dhubaba, 
for both the masculine and the feminine) even if they rallied together to do so, to create it. And if a 
fly should take away something from them, [such as a drop] of the scents or the saffron in which they 
drench themselves, they would not be able to recover that from it, because of their [complete] incapac¬ 
ity: so how can they worship those [whom they suppose to be] partners of God, exalted be He? An odd 
thing — which He has expressed by striking a similitude. Feeble is the seeker, the worshipper, and the 
[thing] sought, the [thing] worshipped! They do not eSteem God, exalt Him, with the esteem He deserves, with the exaltedness [He 
deserves], for they ascribe to Him partners who can neither protecft themselves from a fly, nor retaliate 
against it. Truly God is Strong, Mighty, Victor. God chooses from the angels messengers and [also chooses] from mankind, messengers — this 
was revealed after the idolaters said, Has the Remembrance been revealed to him out of [all of] us? [Q. 
38:8]. Truly God is Hearer, of what they say, Seer, of those whom He chooses as messengers, such as 
Gabriel, Michael, Abraham, Muhammad (s) and others, may God bless them and grant them peace. He knows that which is before them and that which is behind them, in other words, what they 
have offered [in the way of deeds] and what they have left behind, and what they have done and what 
they will do next; and to God all matters are returned.","O people, a similitude is set forth, so listen to it: those whom you invoke besides Allah can never create even a fly, even if they all come together for that. And if a fly snatches something away from them, they cannot retrieve it. How feeble is the invoker as well as the invoked[38]! . They have not revered Allah the reverence He deserves[39]. Indeed, Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty. . Allah chooses messengers from the angels and from mankind. Indeed, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing. . He knows all that is ahead of them and all that is behind them[40], and to Allah returns all matters.","[38] i.e., How feeble are the seekers of the fly and how feeble is the fly! . [39] Because they worshiped others besides Him Almighty. . [40] Allah's knowledge encompasses every aspect of His creations in the past, present and future."
22,77,78,"O you who believe, bow down and prostrate yourselves, in other words, perform prayer, and

in Paradise. And Struggle in the way of God, in order to establish His religion, a Struggle worthy of Him, by 
expending all effort therein ( haqqa is in the accusative because it is a verbal noun). He has elected you. 
He has chosen you for His religion, and has not laid upon you in your religion any hardship, that is, 
[any] constraint, for He has facilitated [adherence to] it during times of difficulty, such as [His permit¬

23,1,11,"Indeed (qad is for confirmation) prosperous, victorious, are the believers, those who in their prayers are humble, and who shun vain talk, and other [nonsense], and who fulfil payment of alms, and who guard their private parts, against what is unlawful, except from their Spouses, that is, to their Rouses, and what [slaves] their right hands possess, 
that is, concubines, for then they are not blameworthy, in having sexual intercourse with them. But whoever seeks [anything] beyond that, [intercourse with] wives and concubines, such as 
masturbation: those, they are transgressors, who have overstepped [the bounds] into what is not lawful 
for them. And who are keepers of their trusts (maybe read as plural, amanatihim, ‘their truSts’, or singular, 
amanatihim, ‘their truSf) and covenants, [made] between them, or between them and God, such as [the 
observance of] prayer and so on. And who are watchful of their prayers (maybe read as plural, salawatihim, ‘their prayers’, or sin¬

Heaven — wherein they will abide: herein is an allusion to the Return [in the Hereafter] and so it is fit¬ 
ting that the Beginning [of creation] should be mentioned next:","The believers have attained true success: . those who humble themselves in their prayers, . and those who turn away from all that is vain, . and those who give zakah[1], . and those who guard their sexual desires[2], . except with their wives or slave women they may own, for then they are free of blame. .

23,12,16,"And, by God, We certainly created man, Adam, from an extraction (min sulalatin, derives from 
[the verbal expression] salaltu’l-shay’a mina’l-shay’, ‘I drew one thing out of another’, meaning, ‘I extract¬ 
ed it therefrom) his [Adam’s] substance being, of clay ( min tinin is semantically connected to sulalatin, 
‘an extraction’). Then We made him, namely, man, the progeny of Adam, a drop, a SJierm-drop, in a secure lodg¬ 
ing, which is the womb. Then We transformed the drop [of semen] into a clot, congealed blood. Then We transformed 
the clot into a [little] lump of flesh ( mudgha ), a piece of flesh, about the size of what one would be able 
to chew (mayumdagh). Then We transformed the lump of flesh into bones. Then We clothed the bones 
with flesh (a variant reading in both instances [instead of the plurals ‘izaman and al-’izama, ‘the bones’] 
is [singular] ‘azman [and c al-‘azma], ‘the bone’; and in all three instances above khalaqnd, means ‘We 
made it become’ [as opposed to ‘We created’]). Then We produced him as [yet] another creature, by 
breathing into him [Our] Spirit. So blessed be God, the bed of creators!, that is, [the beSt of] determiners 
(the SJiecificier noun for ahsana, ‘the beSt’, has been omitted because it is obvious: khalqan, ‘in terms of 
creation’). Then indeed after that you die. Then on the Day of Resurrection you shall surely be raised, for reckoning and requital.

23,17,22,"And verily We created above you seven paths, that is, [seven] heavens ( taraiq is the plural of 
tariqa [so called] because they are the paths used by the angels) and of creation, that lies beneath these 
[paths], We are never unmindful, lest these should fall upon them and destroy them. Nay, but We hold 
them back, as [Stated] in the verse: And He holds back the heaven left it should fall upon the earth [Q. 
22:65]. And We sent down water out of the heaven in measure, that suffices them, and We lodged it 
within the earth; and We are indeed able to take it away, so that they die of thirst together with their 
livestock. Then We produced for you therewith gardens of date palms and vines — these being the moil 
common fruits of the Arabs — wherein is abundant fruit for you, and whereof you eat, in summer and 
winter. And, We produced, a tree that grows on Mount of Sinai (read Sina or Sayna, indeclinable as it is 
a proper noun with the feminine ending denoting a location) that produces (read either as tunbitu from 
the fourth form [anbata], or as tanbutu from the trilateral form [ nabata ]) oil (bi’l-duhni : in the case of 
the former [reading of tunbitu] the ba [bi-] here would be extra, whereas in the case of the second [read¬

and seasoning for those who eat ( wa-sibghin li’l-akilina, a supplement to biT-duhni, ‘oil’, [that is to say] it 
is [like] a dye that colours a morsel dipped in it) — and this [seasoning] is the [olive] oil. And surely in the cattle, that is, [in] camels, cows and sheep, there is for you a lesson, an admoni¬ 
tion for you to heed. We give you to drink (read nasqikum or nusqikum ) of what is in their bellies, [of] 
milk, and you have many uses in them, such as [the extraction of] wool, fur and hairs and other [uses], 
and you eat of them. And on them, the camels, and on ships you are carried.","We have created above you seven levels [of heaven], and We have never been unaware of Our creation. . We send down water from the sky in due measure and cause it to stay in the earth, and We are surely able to take it away. . With this [water] We produce for you gardens of palm trees and grapevines, in which there are many fruits from which you eat, . and [olive] tree that grows at Mount Sinai, producing oil and condiments for those who eat. .

23,23,30,"And verily We sent Noah to his people, and he said, ‘O my people, worship God, obey God and 
affirm His Oneness. You have no [other] god besides Him (ghayruhu is the subject of ma, ‘no’; the pre¬ 
ceding [min ilahin, ‘god’] is the predicate, the min being extra). Will you not then fear?’ His punishment 
in worshipping [gods] other than Him? But the council of his people, who disbelieved, said, to their followers, ‘ 77 i is is juft a human 
being like you who desires to gain superiority, to have the honour, over you, by acquiring followers, 
you being [his] followers. And had God willed, that none other than Him be worshipped, He woidd 
have sent down angels, with that [Message], and not [assigned] a human being [for it]. We never heard 
of such, an affirmation of God’s Oneness as that which Noah summons [us], among our forefathers, 
[among] paSt communities. He, Noah, is juft a man possessed by madness, a case of dementia. So bear with him for a while’, 
until he dies. He, Noah, said, ‘My Lord, help me, against them, because they deny me’, because of their denial 
of me, by destroying them. God, exalted be He, says, responding to his supplication: So We revealed to him [saying], ‘Build the Ark, the ship, under Our watch, under Our observa¬ 
tion and protection, and [by] Our revelation. Our command. Then, when Our command comes, that 
they be destroyed, and the oven, of the baker, gushes, with water — and this was Noah’s sign — bring 
into it, admit into the ship, of every kind [of animal] two mates, a male and a female, that is, [two] of 
every Species thereof ( ithnayn is an objeCt; min, ‘of’, is semantically connected to usluk, ‘bring into [it]’). 
According to the Story God, exalted be He, gathered all the beaSts of prey and the birds and other [ani¬ 
mals] for Noah. As he [Noah] pushed forth his hands into each Species, his right hand would fall upon 
a male and the left upon a female, whereafter he would take them on board the ship (a variant reading

direcft objed, with ithnayn, ‘two’, [being repeated] for emphasis thereof); together with your family — his 
wife [?]‘ and children — except for those againft whom the Word has already gone forth, that they be 
destroyed, namely, his wife and his son Canaan ( Kan an), 1 2 unlike Shem (Sam), Ham (Ham) and Japheth 
(Yafith) whom, together with their three wives, he carried on board. In surat Hud [the following is men¬ 
tioned where Noah is told who he should carry in the ship]: and those who believe.’ And none believed 
with him except a few [Q. 11:40]. It is said that these were six men and their wives. Moreover it is said that 
all those who were on the ship numbered seventy eight, half of them were men and half were women. 
And do not plead with Me concerning those who have done wrong, those who have disbelieved, that I 
should refrain from destroying them. They shall indeed be drowned. And when you have settled, [when] you are balanced, in the Ark together with those with you, 
say, “Praise be to God Who has delivered us from the wrongdoing folk”, [from] the disbelievers and the 
deftruftion that came upon them. And say, upon disembarking from the ship: “My Lord, cause me to land with a landing (read 
munzalan as the verbal noun as well as the noun of place [for ‘landing’]; or manzilan as [meaning] the 
site of the landing) blessed, being that landing or place, for You are the beft of all who bring to land” ’, 
that which has been mentioned. Surely in that, mentioned matter of Noah, the ship and the deStrudion of the disbelievers, there 
are signs, indicators of God’s power, exalted be He, and indeed (wa-in, in has been softened in place of 
the hardened form, its subjecft being the pronoun of the matter) We were putting to the teit, [indeed We 
were] trying the people of Noah by sending him [as God’s messenger] to them and [by] his admonitions 
[to them].","We sent Noah to his people. He said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no god other than Him. Will you not then fear Him?” . The disbelieving chiefs of his people said, “This is only a man like yourselves who wants to be superior to you. If Allah had willed, He could have sent down angels. We have not heard such a thing from our forefathers. . He is just a madman, so bear with him for a while[7].” . Noah said, “My Lord, help me, for they have rejected me.” . So We inspired him [saying], “Make the Ark under Our Eyes and according to Our directions. Then when Our command comes and the oven bursts with water[8], take on board a pair of each species and your family, except those against whom the decree has already been passed. And do not plead with Me concerning those who have done wrong, for they will surely be drowned.” . Then when you and those who are with you have embarked on the Ark, say, “All praise is for Allah, Who saved us from the wrongdoing people.” . And say: “My Lord, make my landing a blessed landing, for You provide the best landing’”. . Indeed, there are signs in this, and We always put people to the test.",[7] Perhaps he may recover from his insanity or his affair may become clear to people. . [8] Or the fountains of the earth gush forth.
23,31,41,"Then, after them, We brought forth another generation, [another] people, namely, and these 
were [the people of] ‘Ad. And We sent among them a messenger of their own, namely, Hud, saying, ‘Worship God! You 
have no other god besides Him. Will you not then be wary?’, of His punishment and become believers? The council of his people, who disbelieved and denied the encounter of the Hereafter, [they 
denied] that they will end up thereat, and whom We had given affluence, whom We had provided with 
comforts, in the life of this world, said: ‘This is only a human being like you: he eats what you eat and 
drinks what you drink. And, by God, if you obey a human being like yourselves (this [clause] contains both an oath and 
a conditional; the re^Jionse belongs to the former [the oath], which [at the same time] suffices in place of 
a re^Jionse for the latter [the conditional]) you will surely then, that is, should you obey them, be losers, 
you will have been duped. Does he promise you that when you have died and become duTt and bones, you shall be brought 
forth? (mukhrajuna, this is the predicate of the firft annakum, ‘that... you’; the second annakum [sim¬ 
ply] reiterates it because of the long separation [between the subjecft and its predicate]). Far-fetched, far-fetched (hayhat is a noun of acftion in the pa ft tense, funcftioning as a verbal 
noun, meaning ba’uda ba’uda, ‘far from it, far from it!’) is what you are promised!, in the way of being 
brought forth from the graves ( li-ma: the lam is extra, for explication). There is nothing, that is, there is no life, but our life in this world: we die, and we live, [again 
only] through the lives of our offering, and we shall not be raised [again]. 

1 This is likely to be a copyist error, since Noah’s wife is destroyed, as mentioned in the subsequent gloss (and in Q. 66:10). 

2 This Canaan cannot be identified with Cainan of Gen. 5:10 who is mentioned some 7 generations before Noah. On the Biblical 
version, where the three sons are mentioned, together with their wives and Noah’s wife (who is also saved) see Gen. 6:ioff. How¬ 
ever, there is a Canaan mentioned in Gen. 9:18 following the Flood, as Noah’s grandson from Ham. It is interesting, however, that 
this same Canaan is cursed by Noah (Gen. 9:25) in a passage that seems to have little relevance to the surrounding narrative.

Tablet ( al-lawh al-mahfuz), wherein deeds are written down; and they, namely, the souls in their acfts, 
will not be wronged, in a single thing thereof, and so nothing is diminished of the reward for good deeds, 
nor is anything [extra] added to the evil deeds. Nay, but their hearts, that is, [the hearts of] the disbelievers, are in ignorance of this, Qur’an, 
and they have other deeds which they will perpetrate besides, the ones mentioned, againSt the believers, 
and they will therefore be chaStised for them. Indeed ( hattd is for inceptiveness) 6 when We seize their affluent ones, their wealthy and their 
leaders, with chattisement, [with] the sword, on the day of Badr, behold! they are supplicating loudly, 
clamouring [in supplication]. It is [then] said to them: ‘Do not supplicate [out loud] on this day! Truly you will not receive help, you will not be pro¬ 
tected, againtt Us. Verily My signs, in the Qur’an, used to be recited to you, but you used to take to your heels, fall¬ 
ing back in retreat, disdainful, of [embracing] faith, because of it, that is, because of the [Sacred] House or the [Mec¬ 
can] Sancftuary and their being inhabitants thereof, secure, in contract to [the situation with] all [other] 
peoples in their hometowns, 7 while in [your] night sessions ( sdmiran is a circumstantial qualifier,) in 
other words, they come together to converse at night around the [Sacred] House, you talked nonsense’

6 That is to say, the particle is not being used in its more usual sense of ‘such that...’ or ‘until...’ where it denotes ‘end’ or ‘purpose’ 
( ghaiyya).

Tafsir al-Jalalayn 

if read] as the fourth form [tuhjiruna, from ahjara ] it means [while] ‘you ^eak falsehood’ about the 
Prophet and the Qur’an). God, exalted be He, says: Have they not contemplated (yaddabbaru should actually be 
yatadabbaru, but the ta has been assimilated with the dal ) the discourse, namely, the Qur’an that is 
proof of the Prophet’s sincerity, or has there come upon them that which has not come upon their fore¬ 
fathers? Or is it that they do not recognise their [own] Messenger and so they rejed him? Or do they say, ‘There is a madness in him’? — this interrogative is meant as an affirmation of 
the truth of the Prophet’s sincerity, and [of the fadt] that messengers did come to pa£t communities, and 
[of the fadt] that they [do indeed] recognise their Messenger to be truthful and trustworthy, and [of the 
fadt] that there is no madness in him. Nay ( bal is for transition), he has brought them the truth, namely, 
the Qur’an that comprises [affirmations of] the Oneness [of God] and the Laws of Islam; but mod of 
them are averse to the truth. And if the truth, namely, the Qur’an, had followed their desires, and come to them with [men¬ 
tion of] what they fancied in the way of God having a partner and a child, may God be exalted above 
such [associations], indeed the heavens and the earth and whoever is in them would have been cor¬ 
rupted, they [the heavens and the earth] would have deviated from their observed order, because con¬ 
tradictions would ensue, as is usually the case, when there is more than one ruler. Nay, We have brought 
them their Remembrance, namely, the Qur’an, in which they are remembered and honoured, but they 
are disregardful of their [own] Remembrance. Or do you ask them for any recompense?, any remuneration, in return for the faith that you have 
brought them? Yet the recompense of your Lord is. His remuneration, His reward and His provision 
[are], better (one reading has kharjan, ‘recompense’, in both instances [sc. kharjan fa-kharju]; another 
has kharajan in both [sc. kharajan fa-khardju]) and He is the bed of providers, the best of givers and 
remunerators. And truly you summon them to a draight path, a [Straight] route, that is, the religion of Islam. And truly those who do not believe in the Hereafter, in resurrection, reward and punishment, 
deviate, swerve away, from the path, that is, the route [to salvation]. And had We shown them mercy and relieved them of the harm affliding them — the famine 
that befell them in Mecca for seven years — they wotdd surely persid in their insolence, [in] their error, 
bewildered, hesitating. And We have already seized them with chadisement, [with] hunger, yet they did not humble 
themselves to their Lord, nor did they devote themselves to prayer, [nor] did they seek [the pleasure of] 
God through supplication. Until ( hatta is for inceptiveness), when We opened on them the gate of a severe chadisement, 
namely, the day of Badr, slaying [them], behold! they are aghad thereat, despairing of anything good.","We do not burden a soul more than what it can bear. We have a Record [of their deeds][28] that tells the truth, and none will be wronged[29]. . But their hearts are oblivious to this[30], and they have other [evil] deeds that they are doing. . But as soon as We seize their affluent ones with punishment[31], they start crying for help. . “Do not cry for help today, for you will receive no help from Us. . My verses were recited to you, but you used to turn back on your heels, . feeling proud of this [Sacred House], spending night in evil talks [about the Qur’an].” . Have they not pondered the Words [of Allah], or has there come to them what did not come to their forefathers? . Or is it that they do not recognize their Messenger, so they deny him? . Or do they say, “There is madness in him?” Rather, he has come to them with the truth, but most of them are averse to the truth. . Were the Truth to follow their desires, the heavens and earth, and all those who are therein would have been ruined. In fact, We have given them their Reminder, but they are averse to their Reminder. . Or do you ask them for some reward[32]? But the reward of your Lord is best[33], and He is the Best of Providers. . Indeed, you are calling them to a straight path, . but those who do not believe in the Hereafter are deviating from that path. . Even if We were to show them mercy and relieve their adversity[34], they would still persist in their transgression, wandering blindly. . We have already seized them with punishment, but they did not humble themselves to their Lord, nor did they supplicate in humility, . until when We open for them a gateway of severe punishment, they will be plunged into utter despair.","[28] It records every word he utters and every act he does. [29] By wrongfully punishing someone or diminishing the reward of those who did good. . [30] They are heedless of the fact that everything they say or do is recorded in a Record, or that they are heedless of the Qur’an. . [31] On the Day of Judgment. . [32] Which did not actually happen.
 [33] This was another proof of the Prophet’s prophethood, for he was conveying the message without demanding any recompense for it; rather, he staked his peaceful life and relationships with his people for accomplishing his mission. . [34] It refers to the famine which occurred in Makkah some time after the advent of prophethood."

Sura al-Mu’miniin And He it is Who dispersed, created, you on earth, and to Him you shall be gathered,

and due to Him is the alternation of night and day, in darkness and brightness, [and through] increase 
and diminution. Will you not then comprehend?. His handiwork, exalted be He, and so refled? Nay, but they say the like of what the ancients said. They, the ancients, said, ‘What, when we are dead and have become duft and bones, shall we 
then be raised? No! (the two hamzas in each of the two instances are either pronounced fully, or with the 
second one not pronounced, but with an alif inserted between the two [hamzas] in both [readings]). Already We and our fathers have been promised this, resurrection after death, before: these are noth¬ 
ing but the fables, the lies, of the ancients’, [mere] jokes and strange tales ( asdtir, the plural of ustura). Say, to them: ‘To whom does the earth and whoever is in it, of creatures, belong, if you [truly] 
knew?’, their Creator and Owner. They will say, ‘To God’. Say, to them: ‘Willyou not then remember?’ (tadhakkaruna, the second 
ta [of tatadhakkaruna ] has been assimilated with the dhal) will you [not then] be admonished and so re¬ 
alise that the One Who has the power to originate creation also has the power to resurreCt after death? Say: ‘Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the Great Throne?’, that is, the 
throne ( kursi ). They will say, ‘God’. Say: ‘Will you not then be God-fearing?’, will you then [not] be wary of 
worshipping [things] other than Him? Say: ‘In whose hand is the dominion, the possession, of all things (the [final] ta [in malakut] is 
hyperbolic), and who protects, while from Him there is no protection, if you know?’ They will say, ‘God.’ (a variant reading [for Allah, ‘God’] in both instances [verses 87 and 89] has 
li’Llah, ‘to God’, which is in keeping with the sense of ‘to whom belongs what has been mentioned?’). 8 
Say: ‘How then are you bewitched?’, [how then] are you duped and turned away from the truth, the 
worship of God alone, in other words, ‘How do you envisage [all] this to be invalid?’. Nay, but We have brought them the truth, veracity, and they are indeed liars, in rejecting it, 
namely [the truth of the following]: God has not taken any son, nor is there any god along with Him; for then, that is, if there were 
a god along with Him, each god would have taken away what he created, he would have made it exclu¬ 
sively his and prevented the other [god] from having any mastery over it; and some of them would surely 
rise up again Cl others, in challenge, juft: as the kings of this world are wont to do. Glorified be God — an 
exaltation of Him — above what they ascribe, to Him, of what has been mentioned. Knower of the Unseen and the visible, what is hidden and what is observed ([if] read in the 
genitive [‘ dlimi’l-ghaybi, ‘Knower of the Unseen’], this is an adjectival qualification; [if] in the nomina¬ 
tive [‘alimu’l-ghaybi, ‘the Knower of the Unseen], this would be the predicate of an implied [preceding] 
huwa, ‘He is’) and exalted, magnified, be He above what they associate!, with Him [of partners].","It is He Who gave you hearing, sight and hearts. How little you give thanks[35]! . And it is He Who spread you on earth, and to Him you will all be gathered. . It is He Who gives life and causes death, and to Him belongs the alternation of night and day[36]. Do you not understand? . But[37] they say the like of what the earlier peoples said. . They say, “Is it that when we die and become dust and bones, will we really be resurrected[38]? . This is what we and our forefathers were promised before; this is nothing but ancient fables.” . Say, “To whom belong the earth and all those who are on it, if you really know?” . They will say, “To Allah.” Say, “Will you not then take heed?” . Say, “Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the Mighty Throne?” . They will say, “Allah.” Say, “Will you not then fear Him?” . Say, “In Whose Hand is the dominion of all things – and He gives protection while none can protect against Him – if you really know?” . They will say, “Allah.” Say, “Then how can you be deluded?” . In fact, We brought them the truth, but they are certainly liars[39]. . Allah has never begotten a son, nor is there any god besides Him. Otherwise, each god would have taken away what he had created, and each would have tried to gain supremacy over the other[40]. Glory be to Allah far above what they ascribe to Him! . Knower of the unseen and the seen. Exalted is He far above what they associate with Him!","[35] The disbelievers, instead of showing gratefulness for the blessings of eyes, ears, mind, and heart; show ingratitude to their Creator. .

[38] The One Who created the earth and everything on it from nothing, it is easy for Him to re-create them once again. .

ning them, the evil [ad], the hurt they cause you — this was [revealed] before the command to fight 
[them]. We know bed what they allege, [what] they invent of lies and [what they] say and so We will 
requite them for it. And say: ‘My Lord, I seek protedion in You from the promptings of devils, [from] their [evil]

that which I have left behind’, [in what] I have waited of my life, in other words [that this affirmation 
might be] in its place. God, exalted be He, says: By no means!, that is, there shall be no return. It, namely, 
[the Statement] ‘My Lord! Send me back’, is merely a word that he speaks, but [a word] in which there is 
no benefit for him; and behind them, ahead of them, there is a barrier, which prevents them from going 
back [to this world], until the day when they are raised, after which [day] there will be no more return. And when the Trumpet is blown, the Horn, at the firSt or second blaSt, there will be no more ties 
[of kinship] between them on that day, for them to boaSt of among themselves, nor will they quedion 
one another, about such [ties], in contrast to their State in the life of this world, because of the gravity of 
the situation that will diStracft them from such [questioning] at certain points during the [Day of] Resur¬

quedioning each other [Q. 37:50]. Then those whose scales are heavy, with good deeds, they are the successful, the winners; and those whose scales are light, because of evil deeds, they are the ones who have lod their 
souls, and so they will be, abiding in Hell. The Fire will scorch their faces, it will burn them, while they glower therein, their upper and 
lower lips having receded from their teeth, and it will be said to them: ‘Were not My signs, in the Qur’an, recited to you, were you [not] threatened therewith, and you 
used to deny them?’ They will say, ‘Our Lord, our wretchedness ( shiqwatuna: a variant reading has shaqawatuna, 
both of which are verbal nouns with the same meaning) overcame us, and we were an erring folk, 
[aStray] from guidance. Our Lord, bring us out of it! Then, if we revert, to disobedience, we will indeed be evildoers’. He will say, to them by the tongue of a Keeper [of Hell], whose proportion is twice the size of 
this world: ‘Begone in it, away with you in the Fire, despicable [as you are], and do notfpeak to Me, about 
relieving you from the chastisement — so that [all] their hope is extinguished. Indeed there was a party of My servants — namely, the Emigrants — who would say, “Our 
Lord, we believe; therefore forgive us, and have mercy on us, for You are the bed of the merciful”.

Sura al-Muminun But then you took them as an objedt of ridicule (read sukhriyyan or sikhriyyan, a verbal noun

Yasir] and Salman [al-Farisi]; 9 until they made you forget My remembrance, which you disregarded, as 
you were engaged in deriding them. Thus these [men] were the cause of the forgetting, which is why this 
[aCt] has been attributed to them, 10 and you used to laugh at them. Indeed I have rewarded them this day, abiding bliss,/or the endurance they showed, while you 
mocked them and caused them hurt. They are indeed the winners’, of what they sought (read innahum 
as [indicating] a new sentence, or annahum as [indicating] a second direCt objeCt of the [verb] jazay- 
tuhum, ‘I have rewarded them’). 11 He, exalted be He, will say, to them by the tongue of a Keeper [of Hell] (a variant reading [for 
qdla, ‘He will say’] has qul, ‘say’): ‘How long did you tarry in the earth, in this world and in your graves, 
in years?’ (‘ adada sinina is a ^Jiecification). They will say, ‘We tarried a day, or part of a day — they are uncertain thereof, deeming it 
shorter [than what it was] because of the gravity of the chastisement they are suffering. Yet ask those who 
keep count!’, namely, [ask] the angels who number the deeds of [all] creatures. He, exalted, will say, to them, also by the tongue of Keeper [of Hell] (a variant reading [for qdla, 
‘He will say’] has qul, ‘say’): ‘You tarried but a little, if only you knew, the length of time you tarried, [you 
would have realised that it is] trivial relative to how long you will tarry in the Fire.","Until when death comes to one of them, he says, “My Lord, send me back, . so that I may do righteous deeds in what I left behind.” No, it is only a word he utters. And behind them is a barrier until the Day they are resurrected[44] . When the Trumpet is blown[45], there will be no kinship ties between them on that Day, nor will they ask about one another[46]. . So those whose scales [of good deeds] are heavy, it is they who will be successful. . But those whose scales are light, they are the ones who have lost their souls, abiding in Hell forever. . The Fire will scorch their faces, leaving them disfigured[47]. . “Were not My verses recited to you, and you used to reject them?” . They will say, “Our Lord, our misfortune overwhelmed us, and we were a people who went astray. . Our Lord, take us out of this; if we returned [to evil], we would certainly be wrongdoers.” . Allah will say, “Stay therein despised and do not speak to Me[48]. . There was a group of My slaves who used to pray, ‘Our Lord, we believe, so forgive us and have mercy upon us, and You are the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.’ . But you took them in mockery until they made you forget My remembrance, and you used to laugh at them. . I have rewarded them Today for their patience; it is they who are the successful.” . He will say, “How many years did you stay on earth?” . They will say, “We stayed for a day or part of a day; ask those who keep count.”[49] . Allah will say, “You only stayed for a while, if only you had known[50].","[44] i.e., Once they die, there will be no chance of returning to the world, and they shall remain in that state until the Day of Resurrection. . [45] When the Trumpet is blown on the Day of Resurrection by an angel, everyone on earth will die. Then it will be blown a second time, and all will raise for Judgment. See 39:68.

tions, where after you would be returned to Us for Us to requite [you] accordingly: And I did not create 
the jinn and mankind except that they may worship Me [Q. 51:56]. So exalted be God, above aimless aCtion and other such things that do not befit Him, the King, 
the Truth! There is no god except Him, the Lord of the Noble Throne (‘ arsh ), the throne ( kursi ), which is 
a seat [similar to a king’s] that is exquisite. 12 And he who calls on another god along with God has no proof thereof (la burhdna lahu bihi, 
an [extra] explicative adjectival qualification that has no [other syntactical] signification), his reckoning, 
his requital, will indeed be with his Lord. Truly the disbelievers will not be successful, they will not be 
felicitous. And say: ‘My Lord, forgive and have mercy, on believers — [this] ‘mercy’ adds to the ‘forgive¬ 
ness’ [in terms of God’s grace] — and You are the be it of the merciful’, the mod: excellent of those who 
have mercy. 


9 Salman al-Farisi (d. shortly after 23/644) was a Companion of the Prophet and one of the mod popular figures of Muslim legend. 
He is said to have recognized the marks of the Prophet, and later at the seige of Medina by the Meccans, to have suggested to the 
Prophet the digging of a trench ( khandaq ) in order to preserve themselves from the enemy; see G. Levi Della Vida, s.v. ‘Salman 
al-Farisi, Eli, iv , 116-17; a useful summary of his life is given by Dhahabi, Siyar, 1, 505-58. 

10 It is not that these men deliberately made them forget Gods remembrance, but that the ad of ridiculing these men led to the 
latter’s forgetting to remember God. 

11 According to the annahum reading the sense would be: ‘I have rewarded them this day for the endurance they showed, [and] 
because they are the winners’.

24,1,3,"This is, a sura which We have revealed and prescribed (read faradnaha, or [the intensive form] 
farradnaha, on account of the large number of prescriptions contained in it) and wherein We have 
revealed manifest signs, [signs] containing clear indications, that perhaps you might remember 
(tadhakkaruna : the second ta [of tatadhakkaruna] has been assimilated with the dhal ), that you might 
be admonished. As for the fornicatress and the fornicator, that is, of those not in wedlock — because those [in 
wedlock] are Stoned according to the Sunna (the al [in al-zaniya, ‘the fornicatress’, and al-zdni, ‘the forni¬ 
cator’] according to some mentioned [opinions] is a relative [particle]; the clause [al-zaniyatu wa’l-zdni ] 
is a subjed, and because of its similarity to a conditional, the fa has been inserted into the predicate, 
which is [the following, fa’jlidu]): Strike each of them a hundred lashes, [a hundred] Strikes (one says 
jaladahu to mean daraba jildahu, ‘he Struck him on the skin). According to the Sunna, in addition to 
this [punishment] there is also banishment for a whole year. The slave, however, receives half of the men¬ 
tioned [punishment]. And do not let any pity for them overcome you in God’s religion, that is to say, in 
[the fulfilment of] His rulings, by disregarding any part of their prescribed punishment, if you believe 
in God and the LaSt Day, namely, the Day of Resurrection: in this [Statement] there is an incitement to 
[abide by] what was [mentioned] before the conditional [above] and it also constitutes the response to 
the latter, or [at leaSt is] an indication of the response to it. And let their punishment, the flogging, be 
witnessed by a group of the believers — some say [that this should be a group of] three; some say four, 
as in the number of witnesses testifying to an acft of fornication. The fornicator shall not marry anyone but a fornicatress or an idolatress, and the fornicatress 
shall be married by none except a fornicator or an idolator, in other words, what is suitable for each of 
the two [for the purposes of marriage] is the above-mentioned; and that, namely, marrying of fornica¬ 
tors, is forbidden to believers, who are better [than those]. This was revealed when the poor among the 
Emigrants resolved to marry the wealthy whores of the idolaters, so that they [the women] would pro¬ 
vide for them. Thus it is said that the prohibition applies Specifically to them; but it is also said to apply in 
general; but it was abrogated by God’s words: Marry off the Spouseless among you [Q. 24:32].","[This is] a Chapter which We have sent down and ordained, and sent down in it clear commandments so that you may take heed. . As for the woman and the man who commit fornication; flog each of them a hundred lashes. Do not let pity for them make you lenient concerning the law of Allah, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a group of the believers witness their punishment[1]. . A man who fornicates would only marry[2] a woman who fornicates or a polytheist, and a woman who fornicates would only marry a man who fornicates or a polytheist. Such marriages are forbidden to the believers[3].","[1] Fornication has to be proven either by confession or the testimony of four reliable witnesses to having actually seen the act take place. This ruling is applicable to unmarried fornicators. Execution by stoning is confirmed in the sunnah for married adulterers. . [2] i.e., is inclined to marry.
 [3] Such persons cannot be married to believers unless they repent."
24,4,5,"And those who accuse honourable women [in wedlock], who are chaSte, of fornication, and then 
do not bring four witnesses, to testify as eyewitnesses to their fornication. Strike them eighty lashes, that 
is, each one of them, and do not accept any testimony from them ever, in anything; and those, they are 
the immoral, for committing a grave sin ( kabira ); except those who repent thereafter and make amends, in their deeds, for God is indeed Forgiving, 
of their [unsubstantiated] accusations, Merciful, to them, in inspiring them to make repentance whereby 
their immorality is curbed and their testimony becomes [once again] acceptable — some say, however, 
that it can never be accepted [thereafter], if the proviso is taken to refer to the laSt clause. 1","As for those who accuse chaste women [of adultery] but fail to produce four witnesses, flog them eighty lashes and do not accept their testimony ever, for it is they who are the rebellious, . except those who repent afterward and mend their ways, for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",

tive as a verbal noun) that he is indeed being truthfid, in accusing his wife of committing fornication, and a fifth time that God’s wrath shall be upon him if he were lying, in this (the predicate of the 
subjed: [fa-shahadatu ahadihim, ‘then the testimony of one of them] is [the implicit] ‘will Spare him the 
prescribed [legal] punishment for [false] accusation’). 

1 That is to say, the proviso refers to and those, they are the immoral’, and not to ‘do not accept any testimony from them’. 


Sura al-Nur And the punishment, namely, the prescribed [legal] punishment for fornication that is established 
upon his testimony, shall be averted from her if she testify [swearing] by God four times that he is in¬ 
deed lying, in accusing her of having fornicated; and a fifth time that God’s wrath shall be upon her if he were being truthful, therein. And were it not for God’s bounty to you and His mercy, in shielding you [from being exposed] 
in such [situations], and that God is the Relenting, in His acceptance of repentance in such [situations] 
and otherwise, Wise, in the rulings He has given for this and other matters, that He might make clear the 
truth therein and hasten punishment for those deserving it.","As for those who accuse their wives [of adultery] but have no witnesses except themselves, then the evidence of one of them is to testify four times by Allah that he is telling the truth[4], . and the fifth [oath] is that may Allah curse him if he is telling a lie. . But she will be spared the punishment if she testifies four times by Allah that he is telling a lie, . and the fifth [oath] is that may Allah’s wrath be upon her if he is telling the truth[5]. . Were it not for Allah’s grace and mercy upon you, and that Allah is Accepting of Repentance, All-Wise, [He would have punished you][6].","[4] In order that he be spared the punishment for false accusation. . [5] It is called li‘ān; once the husband and the wife swear each five times, the marriage is terminated forever. . [6] i.e., ...you would have been punished or scandalized."
24,11,18,"Truly those who initiated the slander, the worSt calumny againSt ‘A’isha — mother of the believ¬ 
ers, may God be pleased with her — accusing her [of fornication], are a band from among yourselves, 
a group from among the believers. She said [that these were] Hassan b. Thabit, 'Abd Allah b. Ubayy, 
Mistah [b. Uthatha], 2 and Hamnabt. Jahsh. ' Do not suppose, O you believers other than the [mentioned] 
band, that it is bad for you; rather it is good for you, for God will reward you for it and reveal ‘A’isha’s 
innocence and [the innocence of] the one who [is supposed to have] committed it with her, namely, 
Safwan [b. al-Mu'attal]. 4 She [‘A’isha] related: ‘I accompanied the Prophet (s) during a raid, and this 
was after the [requirement to wear the] veil had been revealed. When he was through with it [the raid], 
he headed back [to the campsite] and one night, having drawn close to Medina, he announced that all 
should march off [home]. So I walked a distance [away from the campsite] and relieved myself. But when 

1 came back to the campsite, [I realised that] my necklace (‘iqd meaning qilada ) had snapped. So I went 
back to look for it. In the meantime they had strapped my litter’ — in which one rides — ‘thinking that I 
was inside, for in those days women were slight and ate very small portions (' ulqa ). [Finally] I found my 
necklace, but when I went back to where I had been staying overnight, they had already departed. I sat 
in the place where I had camped; I assumed that the group would notice my absence and come back for 
me. But my eyes were overcome [by drowsiness] and I fell asleep. Safwan had pitched camp behind the 
army to reff for some of the night (‘ arrasa ), then set off while it was Still night until he reached the site of 
the camp. He saw what looked like a person sleeping and recognised me when he [eventually] saw me, 
having seen me on numerous occasions before the [requirement of the] veil. I woke up to the sound of 
him saying, ‘To God we belong and to Him we shall surely return’ (inna li’Llahi wa-inna ilayhi rajiun ), 
for he had recognised me. Sol concealed my face with my gown (jilbab ) — in other words, I covered it up 
with my wrap ( muld’a ). 5 By God he did not so much as say a word to me, nor did I hear him say anything 
other than the words, ‘To God we belong and to Him we shall surely return, as he brought his camel to 
its knees and pressed with his foot againSt its foreleg [for me to mount it]. I then mounted it and he set 
off leading me back on the camel until we reached the army which had stopped because of the extreme 
midday heat; some had died [searching] for me. The one who bore the greater share of it [the sinful ac¬ 
cusation] was ‘Abd Allah b. Ubayy b. Salul’... her [‘A’isha’s] words end here; this was reported by the two 
Shaykhs [al-Bukharl and Muslim]. God, exalted be He, says: Upon every man of them shall be the [ onus 
of the] sin which he has earned, in this [affair], and as for him who bore the greater share thereof, that 
is, [him who] assumed moSt of [the responsibility for] it, having initiated it and made it public, namely, 
‘Abd Allah b. Ubayy: there will be an awful chastisement for him, namely, the Fire in the Hereafter. Why, when you [firSt] heard about it, did the believingmen and women not think good ofthem- 

2 Mistah b. Uthatha b. ‘Abbad b. ‘Abd al-Muttalib al-Qurashl: he was present at Badr. He was flogged by the Prophet for his part in 
the false accusation brought against ‘A’isha. Ibn Sa‘d in his Tabaqat States that Mistah died in 34/654 (see the tabaqat al-Badriyyin 
min al-Muhdjirin ); but it is also said that he fought alongside ‘All b. Abi Talib at Siffin dying in 37/657: Ibn al-Athlr, Usd al-ghdba, 
v, 150-1; cf. Dhahabi, Siyar, 1,187-8. For a clear summary of the account of this incident and the ensuing hadith al-ifk, ‘slander’, in 
English, see Martin Lings, Muhammad: his life based on the earlieil sources, (London: Unwin Paperbacks, 1986), chs LXIV, LXV, 
240-46. 

3 Hamna is the sister of Zaynab bt. Jahsh, wife of the Prophet. Her mother was Umayma bt. ‘Abd al-Muttalib, the Prophet’s paternal 
aunt: Ibn al-Athlr, Usd al-ghdba, vii, 71. 

4 Safwan b. al-Mu‘attal al-Sulami al-Dhakwani was present at many battles with the Prophet, including al-Khandaq, and was highly 
esteemed by him. He was killed during the conquest of Armenia during the caliphate of‘Umar b. al-Khattab in 19/640; but one 
report has it that he died near Shimshat, having fought against the Byzantines during the caliphate of Mu‘awiya b. Abi Sufyan, in 
the year 58/677: Ibn al-Athlr, Usd al-ghdba, 111, 31-32.

is] a patent lie? (there is a shift here in the address from the second to the third person), in other words, 
[why did] you [not] assume [good of them], O band [of believers] and say: Why did they, that is, this band [of accusers], not produce four witnesses to it?, who had wit¬ 
nessed it. And since they did not produce the witnesses, those, in God’s sight, in His judgement, they are 
liars, in this [matter]. 

[ 24:14] And were it not for God’s bounty to you and His mercy in the life of this world and the Hereafter

in, an awfid chastisement, in the Hereafter;

‘you were receiving if]; idh, ‘when’, is dependent because of massakum, ‘befallen you’, or afadtum, ‘en¬

a light matter, a sinless [acft], while with God it was grave, in sinfulness.   And why, when you heard it, did you not say, ‘It is not for us to Speak about this. Glory be to 
You! — this [exclamation] here is meant to indicate amazement — This is an awful calumny?’, [an aw¬ 
ful] lie? God admonishes you. He forbids you, leSt you should ever repeat the like of it, if you are [in 
truth] believers, [then] you will be admonished by this. And God clarifies for you the signs, through commands and prohibitions, and God is Knower, 
of what He enjoins and what He prohibits, Wise, therein.","Indeed, those who came up with the slander[7] are a group among you. Do not think that it is bad for you, rather it is good for you[8]. Each one of them is responsible for what he earned of the sin, and the one who played the major role[9], for him there will be a grave punishment. . If only the believing men and women had thought well of themselves, and said, “This is a clear slander!” . Why did they not produce four witnesses to prove it? Now, since they failed to produce witnesses, they are the liars before Allah. . Were it not for Allah’s grace and mercy upon you in this world and in the Hereafter, you would have been afflicted with a great punishment for that [lie] in which you were involved, . when you were passing it from one tongue[10] to the other, and saying with your mouths what you had no knowledge of, and were taking it lightly, whereas with Allah it was a grave offense. . If only you had said when you heard it, “How can we speak about such a thing! Glory be to You [O Allah]! This is a monstrous slander!” . Allah admonishes you not to repeat such a thing ever, if you are [truly] believers. . Allah makes the revelations clear to you, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.","[7] It refers to the incident when the Prophet's wife ‘Ā’ishah was falsely accused by the hypocrites.
 [8] For its reward from Allah; believers being distinguished from hypocrites; and ‘Ā’ishah being absolved from false accusation, etc.

24,19,20,"Truly those who love that indecency should be Spread, by the tongue, concerning those who be¬ 
lieve, by its being associated with them — and the ones [meant] are the band — theirs will be a painful 
chastisement in the life of this world, by way of the prescribed [legal] punishment for [false] accusation, 
and the Hereafter, by way of the Fire, as is God’s due, and God knows, that such [indecency] does not 
apply in their case, and you, O band [of accusers], as regards the calumny of which you s^oke, do not 
know, whether such [indecency] took place among them. And were it not for God’s bounty to you, O band [of accusers] and His mercy and that God is 
Gentle, Merciful, to you, He would have surely hastened to [bring about] your punishment.","Indeed, those who like to see indecency[11] spread among the believers will have a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter; Allah knows and you do not know[12]. .

that is, [he enjoins] vile acfts, and what is reprehensible, if followed, according to the Law. And were it not 
for God’s bounty to you and His mercy notone of you, O band [of accusers], would ever have grown pure, 
after the calumny of which you sSJioke, that is to say, [not one of you] would have ever been reformed or 
purified from this sin by repenting of it. But God purifies whom He will, from sin, by accepting his repent¬ 
ance from him, and God is Hearer, of what you have said, Knower, of your intentions. And do not let those of you who possess bounty, the wealthy, and the affluent swear not to give 
to the near of kin and the poor and those who emigrate in the way of God — this was revealed regarding 
Abu Bakr who swore to provide no more for Mistah, his maternal cousin, a destitute Emigrant who had 
fought at [the battle of] Badr, because of his involvement in the calumny, when thitherto he had provided 
for him. And [it was revealed also regarding] certain Companions who swore not to give voluntary alms 
to those who had participated in [^reading] the calumny in any way. Let them forgive and excuse, them 
in this matter. Do you not love that God should forgive you? And God is Forgiving, Merciful, to believ¬ 
ers. Abu Bakr said: ‘Indeed. I would love that God forgive me’, and he restored [thereafter] to Mistah 
what he used to expend on him.","O you who believe, do not follow the footsteps of Satan; whoever follows the footsteps of Satan, he only enjoins indecency and evil acts. Were it not for Allah’s grace and mercy upon you, none of you would have ever been purified. But Allah purifies whom He wills, and Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. . The people of virtue and affluence among you should not swear to withhold their aid from their relatives, the needy and the emigrants in the cause of Allah. Let them pardon and overlook. Do you not like to be forgiven by Allah? For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful[13].","[13] Abu Bakr As-Siddīq, ‘Ā’ishah’s father, swore to stop his financial help to his poor cousin, Mistah ibn Athāthah, for he took part in the rumors against ‘Ā’ishah.

believe, in God and His Messenger, shall be cursed in this world and the Hereafter; and there will be an 
awfid chastisement for them on the day ( yawma is in the accusative because of the [implicit sense of] ‘permanence’ to which 
lahum, ‘for them’, is semantically connected) when their tongues and their hands and their feet shall tes¬ 
tify againSt them (read [feminine person] tashhadu or [masculine person] yashhadu, ‘testify’) concern¬

deserve, and they shall know that God is the Manifest Truth, since He will have realised for them that 
requital of His whereof they had been in doubt. Among such [people] is ‘Abd Allah b. Ubayy. The ‘hon¬ 
ourable women’ mentioned above are the Prophet’s (s) wives, regarding whom no repentance has been 
mentioned [as being possible] in the case of their being falsely accused; those women regarding whom 
repentance has been mentioned, however, at the beginning of the sura [verses 4-5], in the case of their 
being falsely accused, are women other these [wives of the Prophet]. 6 Vile women , 7 and [vile] words, are for vile men, and vile men for vile women, and the men¬ 
tioned [vile words]. Good women, and as mentioned [good words], are for good men, and good men 
for good women, and the mentioned [good words], that is to say, what suits something vile is its like, 
and what suits something good is its like — such, good men and women, the like of ‘A’isha and Safwan, 
are absolved of what they say, [what] the corrupt men and women [say] about them. For them, for 
good men and women, will be forgiveness and a glorious provision, in Paradise. ‘A’isha felt honoured 
by some of the things [mentioned] in this [verse], namely, that she was created ‘a good woman and was 
promised ‘forgiveness and a glorious provision’.","Those who [falsely] accuse chaste, innocent and believing women are cursed in this life and the Hereafter, and for them there will be a great punishment. . On the Day when their tongues, hands and feet will testify against them for what they used to do. . On that Day, Allah will give them the full recompense that they deserve, and they will know that it is Allah Who is the Ultimate Truth. . Evil women are for evil men and evil men for evil women, and virtuous women are for virtuous men and virtuous men for virtuous women[14]. These [virtuous ones] are innocent of what [the slanderers] say[15]; they will have forgiveness and a generous provision.","[14] Or it means: Evil words and deeds are for evil people, and virtuous words and deeds are for virtuous people.

6 AlmoSt all modern editions of the Jalalayn have misconstrued the Arabic in the last line of this gloss, even though it may be 
simply deduced from the preceding Statement. There is obviously a scribal error: the definite article al- should be attached to sura 
and not to tawba. ‘The beginning of sural al-Tawba', as modern editions have assumed the reading to be, has no bearing on the 
subject matter of this gloss. The Arabic should read wa-man dhukirafi qadhfihinna awwala'l-surati tawbatun ghayruhunna, ‘and 
those regarding whom “repentance” is mentioned at the beginning of the sura are other women. 

7 The adjectives al khabithdt and al layyihdl are feminine plural nouns and so may Stand as adjectival nouns on their own, as refer¬ 
ring to women, or maybe supplemented with other feminine nouns ( al-kalimat al-khabithat). As the Qur’anic Arabic Stands, the 
epithets are understood to be a reference to women, especially because they are countered by similar references to men (here and 
elsewhere in the Qur’an); however, the commentator seizes on the flexibility provided by the feminine to gloss the Arabic as refer¬ 
ring to both ‘vile women and ‘vile words’ — such as were said by those who had falsely accused ‘A’isha.

their adornment except for what is apparent, namely, the face and the hands, which may be seen by 
a stranger, when there is no danger of [either or both falling into] temptation — this being one of two 
opinions. The second [of these] is that [even] this is forbidden because there is a presumption that these 
[parts] will cause temptation — and this is the preferred opinion, if one muSt settle this topic [with a 
definitive opinion]; and let them draw their veils over their bosoms, that is, let them cover up their 
heads, necks and cheats with veils, and not reveal their, hidden, adornment, namely, all that is other

will. And God ftrikes. He illustrates, similitudes for men, by approximating [such similitudes] to their

[knowledge of] how to Strike similitudes. In houses (fi buyutin is semantically connected to yusabbihu, ‘glorify’, that will follow) [whose

until he comes to it and finds it to be nothing, like what he had supposed. Likewise is [the case of] the 
disbeliever who supposes that his deeds, such as some voluntary alms, will benefit him; but when he dies 
and comes before his Lord he will not find his deed, in other words, it will be of no benefit to him; and he 
finds God there, namely, in the place of his deeds, Who pays him his account in full, that is, He requites 
him for it in this world; and God is swift at reckoning, that is, at requiting. Or, [it is that] those who disbelieve, their evil deeds are, as the manifold darkness on a deep sea, 
covered by a billow, above which, that is, [above which] billow, there is [another] billow, above which, 
second billow, there are clouds, these being the, manifold [layers of] darkness, one on top of another, 
the darkness of the sea, the darkness of the fir£t billow, the darkness of the second together with the dark¬ 
ness of the clouds. When he, an observer, holds out his hand, in such layers of darkness, he can scarcely 
see it, in other words, he would not [even] come close to seeing it. And he whom God has not granted 
any light has no light, that is to say, he whom God does not guide cannot be guided.","As for those who disbelieve, their deeds are like a mirage in a plain desert, which a thirsty person deems to be water, until when he reaches it, he finds nothing, but he finds Allah there [in the Hereafter], thus He will pay him his account in full, for Allah is swift in reckoning. . Or [their deeds] are like layers of darkness in a deep sea covered by waves upon waves, above which are clouds - layers of darkness, one above another.

spreading their wings? (saffatin is a circumstantial qualifier). Of each [one of them] He, God, verily 
knows its prayer and its glorification; and God knows what they do — the Statement is predominantly 
directed to rational beings. And to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, the treasuries of rain, provision 
and vegetation, and with God is the journey’s end, the [final] return. Have you not seen how God drives the clouds, moves them along gently, then composes them, 
joining some with others and making scattered pieces as one, then piles them up, some on top of others, 
whereat you see the rain issuing from the midst of them, [from Specific] outlets in them? And He sends 
down from the heaven out of the mountains (min jibalin: min is extra) that are therein, in the heaven 
(fiha substitutes [for mina’l-samai, ‘from the heaven ] with the repetition of a genitive preposition) hail, 
that is, [He sends down] some [hail], and smites with it whom He will and turns it away from whom He 
will. The brilliance of its lightning, its flashing, would almost take away the eyes, that look at it, in other 
words, [it would almoSt] snatching them away. God alternates the night and the day, that is, He brings one in place of the other. Surely in that, 
alternation, there is a lesson, an indication, for those who see, those possessing insight, [an indication] 
of Gods power, exalted be He. And God has created every beaft, that is, [every] animal, from fluid, [from] a SJierm-drop. 
Among them are some that creep upon their bellies, such as snakes and reptiles, and among them are 
some that walk on two feet, such as human beings and birds, and among them are some that walk on 
four, such as [four-legged] beasts and cattle. God creates whatever He will. Truly God has power over 
all things.","Do you not see that all those who are in the heavens and earth glorify Allah, as do the birds with wings outspread? Each knows its [way of] praying and glorification. And Allah is All-Knowing of what they do. . To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth, and to Allah is the final return. . Do you not see that Allah drives the clouds, then gathers them together, then turns them into a heap, and then you see raindrops coming out from their midst? He sends down hail from mountains [of clouds] in the sky, raining it down upon whoever He wills and turning it away from whoever He wills. The flash of its lightning almost takes away eyesight. . Allah alternates the night and day. Indeed, there is a lesson in this for people of insight. . Allah created every living creature from water.

be saved. And he who obeys God and His Messenger, and fears God and fears Him (read yattaqh or yat- 
taqhi), by being obedient to Him, those, they are the winners, of Paradise. And they swear by God solemn oaths that if you order them, to [participate in the] struggle, they

the oaths to which you are not true. Surely God is Aware of what you do’, when you say you will obey

sage] , and you are responsible for that with which you have been charged, of obedience to him. And if 
you obey him, you will be [rightly] guided. And the Messenger’s duty is only to convey [the Message] 
clearly’.","We have sent down verses making things clear, and Allah guides whom He wills to a straight path. . The hypocrites say, “We believe in Allah and in the Messenger, and we obey.” Then a party of them turns away after that. Such are not believers. .

revealed during such [periods]. Neither you nor they, namely, slaves and young boys, would be at fault, 
in entering upon you without asking leave, at other times, that is, after the three times of day [specified]; 
they frequent you, to provide service, [as] some of you [do] with others (this sentence corroborates the 
preceding one). So, just as He has clarified what has been mentioned, God clarifies for you the signs, the 
rulings; and God is Knower, of the affairs of His creatures, Wise, in what He has ordained for them. It is 
said that the ‘permission’ verse ( ayat al-ifti’idhan) was abrogated; but it is also said that it was not [abro¬ 
gated], but that people thought little of negledting to seek permission [in such situations]. And when the children among you, O free men, reach puberty, let them seek permission, at all 
times, fuff as those, [now] older free men, sought permission before them. So God clarifies His signs for 
you, and God is Knower, Wise. And as for menopausal women, who have ceased to menstruate or to bear children because of old 
age, who do not expet I to marry, for that reason, they woidd not be atfaidt if they put off their clothes, 
such a robe, a cloak, or the facial mask over a head veil, in such a way as not to display adornment, that 
is hidden, such as a necklace, a bracelet or an anklet; but to refrain [from doing so], by not putting them 
off, is better for them; and God is Hearer, of what you say, Knower, of what is in your hearts. There is no blame upon the blind, nor any blame upon the lame, nor any blame upon the sick, 
that they be one’s table companions, nor, any blame, upon yourselves if you eat from your own houses, 
that is, [from] the houses of your offspring, or your fathers’ houses, or your mothers’ houses, or your 
brothers’ houses, or your sitters’ houses, or the houses of your paternal uncles or the houses of your pa¬ 
ternal aunts, or the houses of your maternal uncles or the houses of your maternal aunts, or [from] that 
whereof you hold the keys, [from] that which you safeguard on behalf of others, or [from] those of your 
[faithful] friends ( sadiq is [so called] because he is ‘faithful’ ( sadaqa ) to you in his affecftion). In other 
words: one is permitted to eat from the houses of those mentioned, even if they are not present, provided 
that they consent to it. You would not be at fault whether you eat together, in a group, or separately, 
individually ( ashtat is the plural of shatt ). This was revealed concerning those who felt inhibited about 
eating alone and [who] when they could not find a table companion they would refrain from eating. 
But when you enter houses, that are yours, [houses] wherein there is no one, bid peace to yourselves, 
say, ‘Peace be upon us and upon God’s righteous servants’, for the angels will return your greeting; and if 
there is family therein bid peace to them, with a salutation ( tahiyyatan is the verbal noun from hayyd, 
‘he saluted’) from God, blessed and good, and for which one is rewarded. So God clarifies the signs for 
you, that is to say, He sets out for you in detail the [ritual] ceremonies of your religion, that perhaps you 
might comprehend, in order for you to understand this.","O you who believe, let your slaves and those among you who have not reached puberty ask for your permission [to enter] at three times: before dawn prayer, when you take off your outer garments at noon, and after the night prayer; three times of privacy[34] for you. Beyond that there is no blame on you nor on them to move about freely, attending to one another. This is how Allah makes the verses clear to you, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. . When your children reach the age of puberty, let them ask permission [to enter], as their elders do. This is how Allah makes His verses clear to you, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. . As for elderly women who have no interest in marriage, there is no blame on them if they take off their outer garments without revealing their beauty. But if they modestly refrain from it, that is better for them. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. . There is no blame on a blind person, nor on the lame, nor on the sick[35], nor on yourselves[36] if you eat from your houses or from your fathers’ houses or your mothers’ houses or your brothers’ houses or your sisters’ houses or your paternal uncles’ houses, or your paternal aunts’ houses or your maternal uncles’ houses or your maternal aunts’ houses or from the houses the keys of which are in your possession, or your friends’ houses. There is no blame on you if you eat together or separately. But when you enter houses, greet one another with greetings of peace from Allah, which is blessed and delightful. This is how Allah makes the verses clear to you, so that you may understand.","[34] ‘Awrāt: (sing. ‘Awrah) lit., ""exposure"" or ""being uncovered."" .

24,62,64,"Only they are believers who believe in God and His Messenger and who, when they are with 
him, namely, the Messenger, in a coliedive affair, such as [during] the Friday sermon, do not leave, 
when they have an excuse, until they have asked leave of him. Truly those who ask leave of you — it 
is they who believe in God and His Messenger. So when they ask leave of you for some affair, [some] 
matter, of theirs, give permission to whom you will of them, to leave, and ask God to forgive them. 
Truly God is Forgiving, Merciful. Do not, among yourselves, consider the calling of the Messenger to be like your calling of one 
another, by saying, ‘O Muhammad!’ (s), but say, ‘O Prophet of God’, or, ‘O Messenger of God!’ gently, 
respectfully and in a low voice. Verily God knows those of you who slip away surreptitiously, that is, 
those who leave the mosque secretly during the sermon without asking leave, hiding behind something 
(qad, ‘verily’, is for confirmation). So let those who contravene His command, that is, God’s command, 
or that of His Messenger, beware led an ordeal, a trial, befall them, or there befall them a painful chas¬ 
tisement, in the Hereafter. Lo! surely to God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, by way of possession, 
creation and servitude. He is ever aware of how you, O you who are obligated to [the prescrip¬ 
tions of] the Law, are behaving, with regard to faith or hypocrisy, and. He knows, the day when 
they shall be returned to Him (there is a shift here from the second person address [to that of 
the third person]), in other words, [He knows] when this [day] will be — He will inform them.

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","The true believers are those who believe in Allah and His Messenger. When they are with him on a public matter, they do not leave until they ask his permission. Those who ask your permission are the ones who believe in Allah and His Messenger. So when they ask your permission for a private matter, give permission to whom you will from among them, and ask Allah’s forgiveness for them, for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. . Do not consider the Messenger’s summons to you as your summons to one another[37]. Allah surely knows those of you who slip away hiding behind others. So let those who disobey his command beware lest some trial[38] may afflict them or they may be afflicted with a painful punishment. . Surely to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and earth. He knows all what you do[39]. On the Day they return to Him, He will inform them of what they did. And Allah is All-Knowing of everything.","[37] i.e., Do not call him, ‘O Muhammad.’ Rather, call him, ‘O Prophet.’

a new sentence). 


Sura al-Furqan","And they say, “What kind of messenger is this who eats food and walks in the markets?[2] If only an angel had been sent down to him to be a warner with him, . or a treasure had been cast down to him, or he had a garden to eat from it.” The wrongdoers say, “You are following none but a bewitched man.” . See how they call you names[3]. Thus they have gone astray and cannot find a way. . Blessed is He Who, if He wills, could give you better than that: gardens under which rivers flow, and could give you palaces.","[2] i.e., He is just a human being like us. . [3] Such as a magician, a poet, a liar, a madman, and a bewitched."
25,11,16,"Nay, but they deny the [coming of the] Hour, the Resurrection, and We have prepared for 
those who deny the Hour a blaze ( sa‘ir ), a fire that has been set ablaze ( musa“ara ), in other words, an 
intense [fire]. When it sees them from a distant place, they will hear it raging, boiling like an enraged person 
when his heart boils with anger, and roaring, [producing] a powerful noise. Alternatively, what is meant 
by their ‘hearing it raging is their vision of it and awareness of it. And when they are flung into a narrow place thereof (read dayyiqan or dayqan, ‘narrow’, such 
that it constricts them; minha, ‘thereof’, is a circumstantial qualifier referring to makanan, ‘place’, be¬ 
cause it is actually an adjectival qualification of it) bound together, shackled, with their hands bound 
to their necks in chains (the use of the intensive form muqarranina [as opposed to muqranina] is 
meant to indicate a large number), they will at that point pray for [their own] annihilation, and it 
will be said to them: ‘Do not pray for a single annihilation on this day, but pray for many annihilations!’, which will 
be [the nature of] your chastisement. Say: ‘Is that, which is mentioned of the threat of chastisement and the description of the 
Fire, better, or the Garden of Immortality which has been promised to the God-fearing, which will 
be, in God’s knowledge, exalted be He, their requital, [their] reward, and journey’s end?’, [their] 
place of return. 

[25:16 ] In it they shall have what they wish, abiding [therein] — an irrevocable State — it, the promise 
to them of what is mentioned, is a promise binding on your Lord, [a promise] much besought, requested 
by those who have been promised it [as is clear from the following]: Our Lord, grant us what You have 
promised us through Your messengers [Q. 3:194], or requested on their behalf by the angels [who say]: Our 
Lord, and admit them into the Gardens of Eden which You have promised them [Q. 40:8]. ","But they deny the Hour, and We have prepared for those who deny the Hour[4] a Blazing Fire. . When it sees them from a far distance, they will hear its raging and roaring. . And when they are thrown into a narrow space therein, chained together, they will cry out for death. . Do not cry out this Day for death only once, but cry out many times.” . Say, “Is that better or the Eternal Paradise which has been promised to the righteous?” It will be as a reward for them and as a final destination. . They will have there whatever they wish for, abiding therein forever. That is a promise that your Lord has taken upon Himself.”","[4] i.e., the Resurrection Day."
25,17,20,"And on the day when He will assemble them ( yahshuruhum ; a variant reading has nahshuruhum, 
‘We assemble them’) and that which they worship besides God, that is, other than Him, such as the 
angels, Jesus, Ezra and the jinn, and will say, exalted be He, (fa-yaqulu; a variant has fa-naqulu, and 
We shall say’) to those who were worshipped, as a way of establishing the argument againSt the wor¬ 
shippers [of the former]: ‘Was it you (read a-antum pronouncing both hamzas, or by substituting the 
second one with an alif or not pronouncing this [laSt] and inserting an alif between the one not pro¬ 
nounced and the former, or without [such an insertion]) who misled these servants of Mine, causing 
them to fall into error by commanding them to worship you, or did they go astray from the way?, the 
path of truth, by themselves? They will say, ‘Glory be to You — exalted be You above what does not befit You! It was not, 
it would [not] have been right, for us to take any guardians besides You, that is, other than You ( min 
awliya’a, the firSt direcft objecft, the min being extra, [added] to emphasise the negation; the preceding 
[min dunika, ‘besides You’] is the second [direcft objecft]). So how can we command that we be wor¬ 
shipped? But You gave them and their fathers, before them, ease [ of living], by granting [them] long life 
and abundant provision, until they forgot the Remembrance, [until] they became remiss about admoni¬ 
tions and belief in the Qur’an, and became a loft folk’, [a folk] destroyed. God, exalted be He, says: Thus they will deny you, that is, the ones who were worshipped denied those who wor¬ 
shipped [them], in what you allege, namely, that they are gods, and they will neither be able to (read 
yaftatiuna, or [second person plural] taftatiuna ) in other words, neither they nor you will be able 
to, circumvent, ward off the chastisement from you, nor help, nor protecft you from it. And whoever 
of you does evil, [whoever] ascribes partners to God, We shall make him tafle an awful, a severe, 
chastisement, in the Hereafter. And We did not send before you any messengers but that they ate food and walked in the mar¬ 
ketplaces, and so you are like them in this rested, and truly what was said to them is being said to you.

And We have made some of you a trial for others:, a test, trying the rich with the poor, the healthy with 
the sick, the honourable with the vulgar, in each case the latter would say, ‘Why can I not be like the other 
person?’ Will you be fieadfaft?, [and endure] what you hear from those with whom you are tried? (the 
interrogative is meant as an imperative, in other words, ‘Be sdeadfait!’. And your Lord is ever Watchful, 
of those who remain iteadfait and those who become miserable.","On the Day when He will gather them along with those whom they worshiped besides Allah[5], He will say, “Did you mislead these slaves of Mine, or did they stray from the right way on their own?” . They will say, “Glory be to You! It was not for us to take besides You any guardians. But You provided for them and their forefathers pleasures, until they forgot the message, for they were a ruined people.” . Thus they will deny all what you say[6], so you cannot avert [punishment] nor can you get any help. Whoever among you does wrong[7], We will make him taste a great punishment. . We did not send any messengers before you [O Prophet] except that they ate food and walked in the markets. We have made some of you as a trial for others. Will you have patience? For your Lord is All-Seeing.","[5] i.e., Jesus, angels, pious men, saints, etc. . [6] i.e., False gods will deny their worshipers on the Day of Judgment.
 [7] i.e., associate partners with Allah."
25,21,29,"And those who do not expeil to encounter Us, [those] who have no fear of the Resurrection, 
say, ‘Why have the angels not been sent down to us, to acft as messengers to us, or why do we not see 
our Lord?’, so that we might be informed [by Him] that Muhammad (s) is [truly] His Messenger? God, 
exalted be He, says: Assuredly they are full of arrogance within their souls and have become terribly 
insolent, in demanding to see God, exalted be He, in this world (read ‘utuwwan, ‘insolence’ with the 
waw, according to the original root form, as opposed to ' itiyyan with the [ya] substitution as in [surat] 
Maryam [Q. 19:8]).' The day when they see the angels, [while they Stand] together with the reSt of creation, namely, 
on the Day of Resurrection ( yawma is in the accusative because of an implied [preceding] udhkur, 
‘mention’), there will be no good tidings on that day for the guilty, that is, the disbelievers, in contrast 
to the believers for whom there shall be the good tidings of Paradise, and they will say, ‘A forbidding 
ban!’, as was their [the pagan] cuStom in this world whenever a misfortune befell them; in other words 
[they mean] ‘awdhan maadhan, seeking refuge from the angels [who will chaStise them]. God, exalted 
be He, says: And We shall attend to. We shall turn to, the works they did, that were good, such as voluntary 
alms or kindness to kin, a heritable reception of a gueSt or the succour of a troubled person in this 
world, and turn them into scattered duft ( habaan manthuran ), namely, [as] those individual particles 
of duSt which one might observe near a window when the sun is shining through. In other words, [We 
shall make their good works] like those [particles of du^t] in their uselessness, there being no reward for 
such [works], for lack of any [binding] obligation [to reward them therefor]; 1 2 but they are rewarded for 
it in the life of this world. Those who will be the inhabitants of Paradise on that day, the Day of Resurrection, will be in 
a [far] better abode, than are the disbelievers in this world, and a [far] better renting place, than theirs 
[the latter’s]; in other words, a [better] place for qaila, which is a re^t taken during midday during hot 
days. From this [laCt interpretation of maqilan] it has been inferred that the Reckoning will be concluded 
in half a day, as is stated in one hadith. And on the day when the heaven, each of the [seven] heavens, will be tplit asunder with the 
clouds, in other words, [^lit asunder] together with them [the clouds] ( al-ghamam is white cloud) and 
the angels will be sent down, from every heaven, in a [majestic] descent, and this is the Day of Resurrec¬ 
tion (it [yawma, ‘on the day’] is in the accusative because of an implied [preceding] udhkur, ‘mention; 
a variant reading [for tashaqqaqu] is tashshaqqaqu, ‘will be ^Jdit asunder’, where the second ta [of the 
original form tatashaqqaqu] has been assimilated with it the [the shin]; another variant reading [instead 
of nuzzila al-malaikatu, ‘the angels will be sent down’] has nunzilu al-malaikata, ‘We will send down 
the angels’); true Sovereignty on that day will belong to the Compassionate One, with no one else sharing it 
with Him, and it, that day, will be a hard day for the disbelievers, in contract to the believers. And [it will be] a day when the wrongdoer, the idolater, ‘Uqba b. Abi Mu'ayt — who had uttered 
the two-part profession [‘there is no god but God, Muhammad (s) is His Messenger’] but retracted it 
in order to please Ubayy b. Khalaf — will bite his hands, in regret and anguish on the Day of Resur¬ 
rection, saying, ‘O (ya is for drawing attention) would that I had followed a way with the Messenger!, 

1 Although it is not immediately obvious from the English translation of the root c -t-y, the basic shared meaning in both instances 
is ‘to exceed’; in Q. 19:8, the excess’ is in the context of age, while here it is in the context of‘insolence’. 

2 The precondition for any kind of reward in the Hereafter is belief in God and what that entails of belief in His Messenger, the 
Qur’an, and the Laft Day.

Sura al-Furqan 

Muhammad (s), a route to guidance. O woe is me! (yd waylata: the [final] alif stands in place of the [firSt person singular] possessive 
yd’, yd waylati, meaning ‘[alas] for my destruction!’) Would that I had not taken so and so, in other 
words, [that] Ubayy, as friend! Verily he has led me aStray from the Remembrance, namely, the Qur’an, after it had come to 
me, by causing me to recant my belief in it. God, exalted be He, says: And Satan is ever a deserter of, the 
disbelieving, man’, abandoning him and dissociating from him in [times of] tribulation.","Those who do not expect to meet Us say, “Why are angels not sent down to us or why do we not see our Lord?” They have been too proud of themselves, and have transgressed immensely. . On the Day when they see the angels[8], there will be no glad tidings for the wicked, and [the angels] will say, “Absolutely forbidden for you[9].” . We will turn to whatever deeds they did and turn them into scattered dust[10]. . On that Day the people of Paradise will have the best abode and the finest resting place. . On the Day when the sky will split asunder with clouds, and the angels will be sent down in succession. . The true dominion on that Day belongs to the Most Compassionate[11], and it will be a hard day for the disbelievers. . On that Day, the wrongdoer will bite his hands saying, “Would that I had taken a way with the Messenger[12]! . Woe to me! Would that I had not taken so-and-so[13] as a close friend! . He led me astray from the Reminder[14] after it had come to me.” Satan always betrays man[15].","[8] i.e., upon death, after death, upon resurrection, etc. [9] Referring to all good things. . [10] Good deeds of the disbelievers will be of no avail to them on Judgment Day, such as charity, due to their disbelief and denial of the afterlife. . [11] On Judgment Day the whole authority will be for Allah alone; whereas, in this world, Allah gave some authority to kings, rulers, etc. . [12] i.e., followed the Prophet (ﷺ). . [13] i.e., the one who misguided him. . [14] i.e., the Qur’an or Allah’s remembrance. [15] Forsakes him after leading him into evil."
25,30,34,"And the Messenger, Muhammad (5), says, ‘O my Lord, lo! my people, the [tribe of] Quraysh, 
consider this Qur’an as something to be shunned’, to be disregarded. God, exalted be He, says: So, just as We have appointed for you enemies from among the idola¬ 
ters of your people, We have appointed to every prophet, before you, an enemy from among the guilty, 
the idolaters — so be Steadfast as they were; but your Lord suffices as a Guide, for you, and a Helper, to 
bring you victory over your enemies. And those who disbelieve say, ‘Why has the Qur’an not been revealed to him all at once?’, as 
the Torah, the GoSjael and the Book of Psalms [were]. God, exalted be He, says: We have revealed it, thus, 
in parts, [it is], that We may Strengthen your inner-heart with it, and We have arranged it in a Specific 
order, that is to say, We produce it in stages one part after another, gradually and deliberately, in order to 
facilitate its comprehension and its memorisation. And they do not bring you any similitude, to invalidate your mission, but that We bring you the 
truth, that refutes it, and [what is] better [as] exposition, explanation. They are, those who will be gathered on their faces, that is, [those who] will be driven [as cattle], 
toward Hell: they will be in the worSt place, namely, Hell, and furthest aStray from the way, [they will 
be] on a path of error worse than that of others; and this [path] is their disbelief.","The Messenger said, “O my Lord, my people have taken this Qur’an as a thing to be abandoned[16].” . Thus did we assign for every prophet an enemy from among the wicked, but your Lord is sufficient as a Guide and Helper. . Those who disbelieve say, “Why was the Qur’an not sent down to him all at once?” [We sent it] in this way so that We may strengthen your heart thereby, and We have revealed it in a gradual manner. . Whenever they bring you an argument, We bring you the truth and the best explanation. . Those who will be dragged on their faces to Hell – they will be in the worst position and farthest astray from the right path.","[16] i.e., not reading it; not listening to it; not understanding it; not living by it; not conveying it to others; preferring something else to it, etc."
25,35,40,"And verily We gave Moses the Scripture, the Torah, and made Aaron, his brother, [go] with him 
as a minister, an assistant. Then We said, ‘Go both of you to the people who have denied Our signs’, that is, to the Egyptians 
— Pharaoh and his folk. So they went to them with the Message but they [the Egyptians] denied both of 
them. Then We destroyed them utterly. And, mention, the people of Noah, when they denied the messengers, in denying Noah — it is 
as though he were many messengers given the length of time he remained among them; or [it is thus 
expressed in the plural] because to deny him is [equivalent] to denying all the other messengers, for they 
all came with the same [Message concerning] affirmation of God’s Oneness — We drowned them (this 
is the response to lamma, ‘when’) and made them a sign, a lesson, for mankind, thereafter, and We have 
prepared, in the Hereafter, for the evildoers, the disbelievers, a painful chastisement, in addition to what 
[chastisement] may befall them in this world. And, mention, c Ad, the people of Hud, and Thamud, the people of Salih, and the dwellers at 
al-Rass (al-rass ) — the name of a ‘well’; their prophet is said to have been Shu'ayb; although some say 
it was someone else. [The Story is that] they had been sitting around it [on one occasion] when it col¬ 
lapsed beneath them [burying them] together with their dwellings. And many generations, peoples, in 
between, that is, between [the people of] ‘Ad and the dwellers at al-Rass. For each [of them] We Struck similitudes, when establishing arguments againSt them, and We 
destroyed them only after warning [them], and each [of them] We ruined utterly. We destroyed utterly, 
because of their denial of the prophets sent to them. And verily they, namely, the disbelievers of Mecca, will have passed by the town on which an

with atones. This was the principal town of the towns inhabited by the people of Lot; God destroyed its 
inhabitants for their committing acfts of lewdness. Can it be that they have not seen it?, on their journeys 
to Syria, and so take heed thereof? (the interrogative is affirmative). Nay, but it is that they do not expeCl, 
they have [no] fear of [any], resurrection, and so they do not believe.","We gave Moses the Scripture and appointed along with him his brother Aaron as a helper. . We said, “Go, both of you, to the people who have rejected Our signs[17].” Then We destroyed them utterly. . Also the people of Noah, when they rejected the messengers[18], We drowned them and made them an example for mankind. And We have prepared for the wrongdoers a painful punishment. . Also [We destroyed] ‘Ād and Thamūd, and the people of the Well[19], and many generations between them. . To each We gave examples [of the previous nations], and each We destroyed completely. . They have surely passed by the town[20] that was destroyed by a terrible rain [of stones]. Have they not seen it? But they do not expect to be resurrected[21].","[17] i.e., the divine teachings reached them through Prophet Jacob and Joseph, and the righteous people of Israel. . [18] Denial of Noah was equal to denying all of Allah’s messengers. . [19] i.e., people of prophet Shuʿayb, or those mentioned in Surah Yā Sīn (36:13-29), or a tribe of Thamūd, etc. Rass (lit., well); for they killed their prophet by throwing him into or hanging him down an old or dry well. (Well) . [20] i.e., the city of Sodom; the people of Prophet Lot.

25,41,44,"And when they see you, they take you in mockery only, as an objedt of derision, saying, ‘Is this 
the one whom God has sent as a messenger?, as he is wont to claim? — contemptuously of him as one 
not worthy of being a messenger. Indeed (in, softened in place of the hardened form, with its subjedt omitted, namely, innahu) he 
was about to lead us aftray, turn us away, from our gods, had we not flood by them’, he would have 
turned us away from them. God, exalted be He, says: And soon they will know, when they behold the 
chastisement, with their own eyes in the Hereafter, who is further aftray from the way, who is further 
upon the path of error: they or the believers? Have you seen — inform Me [about] — him who has taken as his god his own desire?, that is, 
as something that will be bring about his ruin 3 (the indiredt objedt [ilahahu, ‘as his god’] precedes the 
diredt objedt because it is more important; the clause [beginning] man ittakhadha, ‘him who has taken’, 
constitutes the firft diredt objedt of a-ra’ayta, ‘have you seen’, the second being [the following, a-fa-anta

[ 2 5144] Or do you suppose that mo ft of them liften, listening so as to understand, or comprehend?, what 
you say to them? They are but as the cattle — nay, but they are further aftray from the way, further 
from these [cattle] upon the path of misguidance, for at leaSt they [cattle] yield to the person who looks 
after them, whereas these [disbelievers] do not obey their MaSter, Who is gracious to them. ","When they see you [O Prophet], they only ridicule you, “Is this the one whom Allah has sent as a messenger? . He would have almost led us astray from our gods if we had not been so devoted to them.” But when they see the punishment, they will come to know who is further astray from the right way. . Have you [O Prophet] seen the one who takes his desire as his god, will you then be a keeper over him? . Do you think that most of them hear or understand?[22] They are just like cattle[23], rather they are further astray from the right way.","[22] They follow others blindly.

ow?, from the point of daybreak to the point of sunrise. For had He, your Lord, willed, He would have 
made it Still, ever-present so that it does not disappear with the rising of the sun. Then We made the sun 
an indicator of it, [of] the shadow; were it not for the sun the shadow would not have been known. Then We retraCl it, the extended shadow, to Us by gentle retraction, subtle [retradtion], through 
the rising of the sun. And He it is Who made for you the night as a garment, veiling [you] like a garment, and sleep 
for repose, reft for bodies through the [temporary] cessation of labour, and He made the day for rising, 
[a time] in which all rise to seek their livelihood and so on. And He it is Who sends forth the winds (al-riydha ; a variant has al-rlha, ‘the wind’) difpersing 
before His mercy (nushuran, ‘dispersing’), scattered before the [coming of the] rain (a variant reading 
has nushran, the singular of which is nashur, similar [in pattern] to rasiil, ‘messenger’ [plural rusul ]; an¬

yadhdhakkaru should actually be li-yatadhakkaru, but the ta has been assimilated with the dhal; a vari¬ 
ant reading has li-yadhkuru), that is to say, [so that they may remember] therewith the grace of God. But 
moil people are only intent on ingratitude, on denial of the grace, saying, ‘We have received [this] rain 
because of such-and-such a storm’. And had We willed, We could have sent forth in every town a Warner, to threaten its inhabitants 
[with God’s chastisement]; instead We have sent you to the inhabitants of all towns as a warner for your 
reward to be a great one. So do not obey the disbelievers, in their desires, but Struggle again it them therewith, that is, 
through [adherence to] the Qur’an, with a great endeavour. And He it is Who merged the two seas: letting them [flow] one adjacent to the other: thisonepal- 
atable, sweet, and the other saltish, bitter; and He set between the two an isthmus, so that the one does 
not mix with the other, and a forbidding ban, a shield that prevents the two from becoming mixed. And He it is Who created man from water, [He created] from a SJierm-drop a human being, and 
made for him ties of blood and ties of marriage, whether it be a male or a female, they marry for the 
purposes of procreation. For your Lord is ever Powerful, with the power to do whatever He will. And they, the disbelievers, worship besides God that which neither benefits them, when they 
worship it, nor harms them, should they refrain therefrom — and these are idols; and the disbeliever is 
ever a partisan againSt his Lord, an assistant to Satan through his obedience to him.","Do you not see how your Lord extends the shade? If He had willed, He could have made it still. Then We made the sun an indication of it[24]. . Then We gradually draw it towards Us [i.e., Then the sun climbs up]? . It is He Who has made the night as a garment[25] for you, and made sleep for rest; and has made daytime for returning to life[26]. . It is He Who sends the winds as harbingers before His mercy, and We send down from the sky pure water, . so that We may revive therewith a dead land, and quench the thirst of countless beasts and humans We have created. . We distribute it among them so that they may take heed[27], but most people persist in their ingratitude. . If We had willed, We could have sent to each town a warner[28]. . So do not obey the disbelievers, but strive against them with this [Qur’an] a great striving. . It is He Who merges the two bodies of water: one fresh and palatable and the other salty and bitter, and He has made between them a barrier and an insurmountable partition[29]. . It is He Who created human beings from water[30], then made between them bonds of kinship and marriage, for your Lord is Most Capable. . Yet they worship besides Allah that which can neither benefit nor harm them; the disbeliever always collaborates against his Lord[31].","[24] i.e., indication for its existence or making it apparent. . [25] It covers you in darkness and provides rest.
 [26] To return to your livelihood and activity. . [27] Such as Allah’s ability to bring the dead to life. . [28] But instead, Allah sent Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) as the final messenger for all people. . [29] When salt and fresh waters meet, although both mix together, each still keeps its distinctive qualities, as if a barrier prevents them from mixing completely. . [30] i.e., the zygote (the mixture of sperm and egg). . [31] i.e., helping and defending those who rebel against Allah."
25,56,62,"And We have not sent you except as a bearer of good tidings, of Paradise, and as a warner, a

have been sent, any reward, except that whoever wishes to follow a way to his Lord [should do so]’, by 
expending his wealth for the sake of [attaining] God’s pleasure, exalted be He; then [whoever wishes to

created them in an instant, but His not having done so is because He will to teach His creatures to be

well aware, to inform you about His attributes! And when it is said to them, to the disbelievers of Mecca, ‘Prostrate yourselves before the Com¬ 
passionate One’, they say, And what is the Compassionate One? Should we prostrate ourselves to what¬

bidding is Muhammad (s) — when we do not know who He is? No! And it, this that is said to them, 
increases their aversion, to faith. God, exalted be He, says: Blessed, magnified, is He Who has placed in the heaven constellations, 
twelve [of them]: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo ( al-sunbula ), Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, 
Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces. They are the mansions for the seven orbiting planets: Mars rules Aries 
and Scorpio, Venus: Taurus and Libra, Mercury: Gemini and Virgo, the Moon: Cancer, the Sun: Leo, 
Jupiter: Sagittarius and Pisces, and Saturn: Capricorn and Aquarius; and has, also, placed in it a lamp, 
namely, the sun, and a shining moon (a variant reading [for sirajan, ‘sun’] has the plural surujan, which

would mean ‘luminous stars’). The moon is singled out for mention because of its particular merit. And He it is Who made the night and day [to appear] in succession, that is, one succeeding the 
other, for him who desires to remember (read yadhdhakkara or yadhkura, as before [Q. 25:50]) — so that 
if he misses [the opportunity to do] some good during the one, he can do it during the other; or desires 
to be thankful, for the graces of his Lord to him during both [of these periods].","We have not sent you [O Prophet] except as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner. . Say, “I do not ask you for any reward for it, except that anyone who wishes to take a path to his Lord[32].” . Put your trust in the Ever-Living Who never dies, and glorify Him with praise. He is Sufficient as All-Aware of the sins of His slaves – . it is He Who created the heavens and earth and all that is between them in six Days[33], then rose over the Throne[34]. He is the Most Compassionate, so ask about Him the One Who is All-Aware. . When it is said to them, “Prostrate to the Most Compassionate,” they say, “What is ‘the Most Compassionate?’ Shall we prostrate to what you order us?” And it only increases their aversion. . Blessed is He Who placed in the sky constellations and placed therein a radiant lamp[35] and a luminous moon. . It is He Who made the night and the day to follow each other so that everyone who wishes may reflect or become grateful.","[32] By spending in the way of Allah. . [33] The ""six Days"" does not necessarily mean six 24 hours of time; for a heavenly Day is 1,000 years of our time.

subject ‘the servants of the Compassionate One’; however because of the length of the intervening passages, the predicate will be 
given in the English as the series of adjectival qualifications and so the reader will find the predicate indicated by the verb ‘are’, im¬ 
mediately after the initial subjed, whereas according to the commentator’s gloss one would have to wait until verse 75 for the real 
predicate. In other words, read without the intervening passages and with the grammatical qualifications mentioned above, the 
Statement would be: ‘The [true] servants of the Compassionate One ... those, they will be rewarded with the sublime abode’.

removes. But, why should He be concerned with you when, you have denied, the Messenger and the 
Qur’an, and so that, the chastisement, will remain binding’, permanently bound to you in the Hereafter, 
in addition to what will befall you in this world; and so on the day of Badr seventy of them were slain (the

[ ayatu’l-kitabi ] conveys the [partitive] meaning of min),' [the Manifest meaning] the one that manifests 
what is truth from what is falsehood. Perhaps, O Muhammad (s), you might kill yourself, out of distress for the reason, that they, 
namely, the people of Mecca, will not become believers ( la’alla here expresses sympathy, in other words 
[what is meant is] ‘have pity on it [your self] by alleviating [the burden of] this distress’). If We will We will send down to them a sign from the heaven before which their necks will remain

which in facft refers to those who possess them, the adjecftival form [khadiun, ‘bowed in humility’] used 
therein is the one [normally] used for rational beings). And there would never come to them from the Compassionate One any remembrance, any [rev¬ 
elation from the] Qur’an, that is new (muhdathin, is an explicative adjecftive) but that they used to 
disregard it. Verily then they have denied, it; but soon there will come to them the news, the consequences, of 
that which they used to deride. Have they not contemplated, observed, the earth, how many We have caused to grow therein, in 
other words, [We have caused to grow therein] many, of every splendid kind [of vegetation], [of every] 
fair Species. Surely in that there is a sign, an indication of the perfection of His power, exalted be He; but mo it 
of them, in God’s knowledge, are not believers ( kana here according to Slbawayhi 1 2 is extra). And surely your Lord, He is the Mighty One, Who will exadt vengeance from the disbelievers, the 
Merciful, Who shows mercy to believers.","Tā sīn mīm.[1] . These are the verses of the clear Book. . Perhaps you[2] will grieve yourself to death because they do not believe. .

26,10,22,"And, mention, O Muhammad (s), to your people, when your Lord called to Moses, on the night 
he saw the fire and the bush, [saying]: ‘Go to the wrongdoing folk, as a messenger, Pharaoh’s folk, to them as well as him — they wronged their souls by disbelieving in God and 
[wronged] the Children of Israel by enslaving them — Will they not ( a-la : the hamza indicates a nega¬ 
tion meant as a rebuke) show fear?’, of God by being obedient to Him and affirm His Oneness? He, Moses, said, ‘My Lord, I fear they will deny me, and that anguish will constrain my breait, because of their denial of me, and that my tongue 
will not utter clearly, to deliver the Message, because of the knot in it. So give the Mission to, my brother, 
Aaron, alongside me.

Sura al-Shuara And I have sinned against them, by my slaying of the Egyptian man, and I fear they will slay 
me’, for this. Said He, exalted be He: ‘Certainly not!, they shall not slay you. Go both of you, you and your 
brother — this address [although in the dual form] is predominantly for the person present as opposed 
to the absent one — with Our signs. We will indeed be with you, hearing, what you say and what is said 
to you ( ma’akum: the two [Moses and Aaron] are referred to here with the plural pronoun). So the two of you approach Pharaoh and say, “Indeed We are — [indeed] each of the two of us 
is, the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds, to you, that you should let go forth with us, to Syria, the Children of Israel”’. So they approached him 
and said to him that which has been mentioned. He, Pharaoh, said, to Moses, ‘Did we not rear you among us, in our homes, as a child?, as an 
infant, only recently born but weaned, and did you not flay with us for years of your life?, for thirty years 
— he would dress from Pharaohs clothes and ride chariots of his, and was referred to as Pharaoh’s son. And you committed that deed of yours — namely, his slaying of the Egyptian — being an in¬ 
grate’, a denier of my favours to you in having reared you [among us] and not enslaved you. He, Moses, said, ‘I did that then, when I was adray, from the knowledge and the Message which 
God would later give me. So I fled from you, as I was afraid of you. Then my Lord gave me judgement, knowledge, and 
made me one of the messengers. That is a favour with which you now reproach me that you have enslaved the Children of Israel’ 

(an ‘abbadta bani Isrd’il, is explicative of tilka, ‘that’) in other words, you have enslaved them but not me: 
there is no favour in that, for your enslavement of them is wrong (some [scholars] have reckoned there to 
be an interrogative hamza of denial at the beginning of this verse [a-tilka mmatun, ‘is that a favour?’]).","And [remember] when your Lord called out to Moses, “Go to the wrongdoing people – . the people of Pharaoh; will they not fear [the punishment of] Allah?” . He said, “My Lord, I fear that they may reject me, . and I will feel distressed and my tongue will not be fluent, so send Aaron along [to help me]. . Moreover, they have a charge against me, so I fear they may kill me[4].” . Allah said, “Certainly not! Go, both of you, with Our signs[5]; We are with you, listening. . Go to Pharaoh and say, ‘We are the messengers[6] from the Lord of the worlds, . that you let the Children of Israel go with us.’” . Pharaoh said, “Did we not bring you up as a child among us, and you stayed with us several years of your life? . Yet you did what you did[7], and you are extremely ungrateful.” . He said, “I did it when I had no guidance. . So I fled from you in fear. Then my Lord gave me wisdom and made me one of the messengers. . Is this a favor that you remind me with, that you have enslaved the Children of Israel?[8]","[4] For killing a Coptic Egyptian by mistake before becoming a prophet. . [5] i.e., the miracles of the staff and the shining hand, given to Moses. . [6] The singular form in Arabic denotes that they both were sent with a single message. . [7] i.e., striking the Copt in support of a man from your people, who died as a result. . [8] i.e., If you had not been cruel to the Israelites, I should not have been brought to your house for upbringing."
26,23,40,"Pharaoh said, to Moses, ‘And what is “the Lord of the Worlds” ’, the One Whose Messenger you 
say you indeed are? In other words: what exadly is He? And since there is no way for creation to know 
the true nature of God, but only to know Him through [an articulation of] His attributes, Moses, bless¬ 
ings and peace be upon him, refunds to him with [mention of] some of these [attributes]: He said, ‘The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, in other words, 
the Creator of [all] that — should you have convidion’, that He, exalted be He, is their Creator, then 
believe in Him alone. He, Pharaoh, said to those, noblemen among his folk, who were around him, ‘Did you not 
hear?!’, his response, how it does not correspond to the question [I asked] ? He, Moses, said, ‘Your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers’. Now, even though this [fad] is 
comprised by what was [said] before it enrages Pharaoh, and therefore: He said, ‘Verily this messenger of yours sent to you is a madman!’ He, Moses, said, ‘The Lord of the ead and the wed and all that is between them — should you 
comprehend,’, that He is such [a Lord] then believe in Him alone. He, Pharaoh, said, to Moses: ‘Ifyou choose any god other than me, I will surely make you a pris¬ 
oner!’. His [Pharaoh’s] prison was very harsh, for a person would be shut up [in a dungeon] underground 
alone, where he could neither see nor hear anyone else. He, Moses, said, to him: ‘What, would you do this even, if I bring you something manifest?’.

patent proof of my Mission? He, Pharaoh, said, to him: ‘Then bring it, if you are truthful’, in this. So he threw down his Staff, and lo! it was a manifest serpent, a great snake. Then he drew out his hand, he brought it out of his pocket, and lo! it was white, glowing, before 
the onlookers, and not its usual skin colour. He, Pharaoh, said to the council around him, ‘Surely this man is a cunning sorcerer, an expert 
in the art of magic, who seeks to expel you from your land by his sorcery. So what do you advise?’ They said, ‘Put him and his brother off for a while, postpone [judgement of] their affair, and 
send muSterers into the cities t° bring you every cunning sorcerer’, to surpass Moses in the art of magic. So the sorcerers were assembled at a fixed time of a known day, which was the morning of the 
Festival Day. And it was said to the people, ‘Willyou assemble!’ Maybe we will follow the sorcerers, should they be the victors’ (the interrogative [of the previous 
verse] is an incitement to assemble and the optative sense [implicit in la’alia] is due to their anticipation 
of victory, and hence their continued adherence to their religion and rejection of Moses).","Pharaoh said, “What is ‘the Lord of the worlds’?” . Moses said, “The Lord of the heavens and earth and all that is between them, if only you had sure faith.” . Pharaoh said to those around him, “Did you hear [what he just said]?” . Moses said, “Your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers.” . Pharaoh said, “Your messenger who has been sent to you is truly insane!” . Moses said, “Lord of the east and west and all that is between them, if only you had sense!” . Pharaoh said, “If you take any god other than me, I will throw you into prison.” . Moses said, “What if I bring you a clear proof?” . Pharaoh said, “Bring it then if you are truthful!” . So he threw down his staff, and suddenly it was a real serpent. . And he drew out his hand, and it was glowing white to the beholders. . Pharaoh said to the chiefs around him, “This is indeed a learned magician! . He wants to drive you out of your land with his magic. What do you suggest?” . They said, “Let him and his brother wait and dispatch heralds to the cities . to bring you every learned magician.” . So the magicians were assembled at an appointed time on a known day[9]. . And it was said to the people, “Will you join the gathering, . so that we may follow the magicians, if they are victorious?”","[9] i.e., the morning of the festival day. See 20:58-59."
26,41,51,"So when the sorcerers came, they said to Pharaoh, ‘Shall we indeed (read a-inna either by pro¬ 
nouncing both hamzas, or by not pronouncing the second, but in both cases inserting an alif) have a 
reward if we were to be the victors?’ He said, ‘Yes [of course]! And you shall then be among those closest [to me]’. Moses said to them, after they had said to him. Either you caSl, or we shall be the carters [Q. 
7:115]: ‘CaSt what you have to caSt’ — the command to do this signifies an authorisation for them to cast 
and a means whereby the truth will be made to prevail. So they caSt their ropes and their Staffs, and said, ‘By the power of Pharaoh we shall surely be 
the victors!’ Thereat Moses caSt his Ttaff and lo! it was swallowing ( talqafu : one of the original two ta letters 
[of taltaqifu] has been assimilated) what they had faked, [what they had] transformed through illusion, 
making their ropes and staffs appear to be moving serpents. So the sorcerers fell down prostrating. They said, ‘We believe in the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of Moses and Aaron’, for they realised that what they had witnessed in the case of the 
£taff could not have been the result of [mere] sorcery. Pharaoh said, ‘Do you believe ( a-dmantum , read pronouncing both hamzas or replacing the 
second one with an alif) him, Moses, though I have not given you leave? He is indeed your chief, the 
one who has taught you sorcery — so that he only taught you some [tricks] and then surpassed you with 
others. Soon you will know, what I will do with you! I will assuredly cut off your hands and legs on op¬ 
posite sides — in other words, the right hand of each one together with his left leg — then I shall surely 
crucify you all.’ 


346 


Sura al-Shuara They said, ‘There is no harm [in that], no damage will be done to us thereby. Surely to our Lord, 
after we die, whichever way that may be, we shall return, in the Hereafter. Indeed We hope our Lord will forgive us our iniquities, for being the frit to believe’, in our 
time.","When the magicians came, they said to Pharaoh, “Will there be a reward for us if we are victorious?” . He said, “Yes, and then you will surely be of those who are close to me.” . Moses said to them, “Throw whatever you wish to throw.” . So they threw their ropes and staffs, and said, “By the glory of Pharaoh, it is we who will be the victorious!” . Then Moses threw his staff, and at once it swallowed up all objects of their illusion. . So the magicians fell down in prostration. . They said, “We believe in the Lord of the worlds, . the Lord of Moses and Aaron.” . Pharaoh said, “How dare you believe in him before I give you permission. Indeed, he is your master who taught you magic, but you will soon come to know. I will surely cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, then I will crucify you all.” . They said, “No harm; we will surely return to our Lord. . We hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins, as we are the first of the believers.”",
26,52,68,"And We revealed to Moses, after many years which he SJient among them calling them to the 
truth with Gods signs but all of which only increased them in insolence, [saying], ‘Journey with My 
servants, the Children of Israel, by night (a variant reading [for an asri ] is an isr, from the verb sard, one 
form of asrd ) go with them by night in the direction of the sea, for indeed you will be pursued’. Phar¬ 
aoh and his armies will pursue you, but when they enter the sea in pursuit of you, I will deliver you and 
drown them. Then Pharaoh, having been informed of their night departure, sent to the cities — it is said that 
he ruled a thousand cities and twelve thousand villages — mufterers, to assemble the army, saying: ‘Lo! these are but a small gang. It is said that they [the Children of Israel] numbered 670,000, 
while his [Pharaohs] vanguard alone numbered 700,000 and so he deemed their number insignificant 
in comparison to his huge army. And indeed they have enraged us, their actions infuriate us, and indeed we are all on our guard’, ready (a variant reading [for hadhiruna] has hadhirun, 
meaning ‘alert’). God, exaltedbe He, says: So We made them. Pharaoh and his folk, go forth, out of Egypt, in order 
to pursue Moses and his people, from gardens, orchards on either side of the Nile, and springs, streams 
running from the Nile through their dwellings, and treasures, visible riches of gold and silver — these [riches] are called kunuz [as opposed to 
amwdl, riches’] because that [portion] which is [always] due to God, exalted be He, from them had not 
been paid — and splendid places, exquisite residences for princes and ministers surrounded by their 
retinues. So [it was], that is, Our expulsion [of them] was as We have described, and We made the Chil¬ 
dren of Israel to inherit these, after drowning Pharaoh and his folk. Then they pursued them, they caught them up, at sunrise. And when the two hofts sighted each other, the companions of Moses said, ‘We have been 
caught!’. Pharaoh’s hoSls have caught us up and we have no power against them. He, Moses, said, ‘Certainly not!, they shall not catch us up; indeed I have my Lord with me, to 
provide assistance. He will guide me’, to the route of deliverance. God, exalted be He, says: Thereupon We revealed to Moses: ‘Strike the sea with your Ctaff’, and 
he Struck it, whereupon it parted, it SJilit into twelve parts, and each part was as a mighty mountain, 
between each of these parts were paths which they followed, such that not even the saddles or the felts 
of the riders were touched by water. And there We brought near the others. Pharaoh and his folk, until they followed them across the 
same paths. And We delivered Moses and all those who were with him, by bringing them out of the sea while 
it was in the State mentioned [above]. Then We drowned the others. Pharaoh and his folk by closing the sea on them after they had

entered the sea and the Children of Israel had exited therefrom. Surely in that, drowning of Pharaoh and his folk, there is a sign, a lesson for those [genera¬ 
tions] who would come after them; but moil of them are not believers, in God. The only ones to believe 
were Asiya — Pharaoh’s wife — Hizqll, the believing man of Pharaoh’s family, and Maryam daughter of 
NamusI, she who pointed out the bone remains of [the prophet] Joseph, peace be upon him. And surely your Lord, He is the Mighty, for He wrought vengeance upon the disbelievers by 
drowning them, the Merciful, to believers, delivering them from drowning.","We inspired Moses, “Leave with My slaves by night; you will surely be pursued.” . So Pharaoh sent heralds to the cities[10], . saying, “These are but a small band, . and they have enraged us, . but we are all well-prepared.” . Thus did We drive them[11] out of their gardens and springs, . and their treasures and splendid dwellings. . So it was, and We made the Children of Israel to inherit them. . They pursued them at sunrise. . When the two groups saw each other, the companions of Moses said, “We are surely overtaken!” . Moses said, “Certainly not! My Lord is with me; He will guide me.” .

26,69,89,"And recite to them, the disbelievers of Mecca, the tiding, the tale, of Abraham (Ibrahima is sub¬ 
stituted by [the following, idh qdla, ‘when he said’]) when he said to his father and his people, ‘What do you worship?’ They said, ‘We worship idols — they reiterate the verb [in the response] in order to supplement 
it with [the following remark] — and remain cleaving to them’, we remain worshipping them all day;

being killed or being taken captive; and in the Hereafter they will be the greatest losers, because they will 
end up in the Fire which has been made everlasting for them. And truly you — this is an address to the Prophet (s) — are receiving the Qur’an, it is being trans¬ 
mitted to you intensely, from One Wise, Knowing, in such [transmission].","Tā Sīn[1]. These are the verses of the Qur’an and a clear book; . a guidance and glad tidings for the believers, . those who establish prayer and give zakah, and who firmly believe in the Hereafter. . As for those who do not believe in the Hereafter, We have made their deeds appealing to them, so they wander blindly. . Such are those who will have a terrible punishment, and it is they who will be the greatest losers in the Hereafter. . Indeed, you are receiving the Qur’an from the All-Wise, All-Knowing.",[1] See footnote 2:1.
27,7,14,"Mention, when Moses said to his family, [to] his wife, during his journey from Midian [back] 
to Egypt: ‘Assuredly I notice, I see in the distance, afire. I will bring you news from there, about the 
[journey’s] route — for he had loSt his way — or bring you a firebrand (read as a genitive annexation [bi- 
shihabi qabasin] as an explication [of shihab, ‘flame’]; or read without [annexation, bi-shihabin qabasin ] 
meaning, a flame of fire at the end of a wick or a wooden Stick) that perhaps you might warm your¬ 
selves’, (tastalun: the ta replaces the ta of the [8 th verbal form] ifta’ala [sc. istala ]; it derives from salaya 
or saliya, ‘to be exposed to the blaze of fire’), [that perhaps] you might warm yourselves from the cold. But when he reached it, he was called [with the following words]: ‘Blessed is he, that is to say, God 
bless him, who is in the fire, namely, Moses, and who is around it, namely, the angels — or vice-versa

is meant to declare that God is above all evil [associations]. O Moses, lot, in other words, the fadt is that, it is 1, God, the Mighty, the Wise. Throw down your ftaff’, and he threw it down. And when he saw it wriggling, moving, like a 
serpent, a slender snake, he turned his back inflight and did not come back. God, exalted be He, says: 
‘O Moses, do not fear, it. Surely in My presence, before Me, the messengers do not fear, any snake or 
otherwise, except him who has wronged, his soul, but then changed [his wrong] for good — he [then] 
performs [good deeds] — after [having done] evil, in other words, [he has] repented, then truly I am

essentially it explains the repetition of the pronoun hum in the statement: ‘and [those] who, of the Hereafter, they are certain’.

Forgiving, Merciful, I will accept his repentance and forgive him. And insert your hand into your bosom, into the collar of your shirt, and it will emerge, not in its 
usual skin colour, but, white without any blemish, any [vestige of] leprosy, with a glare that dazzles the 
eyes, as one sign, among nine signs, with which you shall be sent [as God’s messenger], to Pharaoh and 
his folk; indeed they are an immoral lot’. But when Our signs came to them plain to see, illuminating and clear, they said, ‘This is manifest 
sorcery’, clear and evident [sorcery]. And they denied them, they did not affirm them, though, in reality, their soids had been con¬ 
vinced, in other words, [though] they were certain that these [signs] were from God, wrongfully and 
arrogantly, in defiance of believing in what Moses had brought ([these two adverbs] refer back to [the 
cause of] their denial). So behold, O Muhammad (s), how was the sequel for the agents of corruption, [a 
sequel] which you know: they were destroyed.","[Remember] when Moses said to his family, “I have spotted a fire. I will bring you some news[2] from there, or bring you a burning brand so that you may warm yourselves.” . When he came to it, he was called, “Blessed is He Who is at the fire and those who are around it[3]. Glory be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. . O Moses, verily this is Me – Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. . Throw down your staff!” But when he saw it slithering as if it were a snake, he turned and ran away without looking back. “O Moses, do not be afraid! Indeed, the messengers should have no fear in My presence, . except he who does wrong, then substitutes good for evil, then I am indeed All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. . Put your hand into your garment, it will come out shining white without blemish, as one of nine signs to Pharaoh and his people[4], for they are indeed a rebellious people.” . But when Our visible signs came to them, they said, “This is clear magic.” . They denied them wrongfully and arrogantly, although their hearts were convinced that they were true. See then how was the end of those who spread corruption!","[2] For they lost their way in the dark while traveling from Midian to Egypt. . [3] i.e., the angels around the fire. . [4] See footnote 23:45."
27,15,19,"And verily We gave David and Solomon, his son, knowledge, of rendering [decisive] judgement 
between people, and [knowledge] of the ijieech of birds and of other things, and they said, giving thanks 
to God, ‘Praise be to God Who has favoured us, with prophethood and the diijiosal of jinn, humans and 
devils [to our service], over many of His believing servants’. And Solomon inherited from David, prophethood and knowledge exclusively from among all 
his other children; and he said, ‘O people, we have been taught the speech of the birds, that is, the ability 
to understand their sounds, and we have been given of all things, given to prophets and kings. Indeed 
this, gift, is the manifest, the evident , favour’. And, on one journey, Solomon’s hofls of jinn and humans and birds flood assembled for him as 
they were being arrayed, brought together [in groups] and marshalled. When they came to the Valley of the Ants — which is [located] either in Ta’if or in Syria, and 
whose ants are either small or large — an ant, the queen ant, who had seen Solomons hosts, said, ‘O 
ants, enter your dwellings, lefl Solomon and his hofls crush you while they are unaware!’ — the ants 
are likened to rational beings in their use of the latter’s Speech. Whereat he, Solomon, smiled (fa-tabassama, the beginning [of the sentence]) amused (dahikan, 
the end [of the sentence]) at its words, which he had heard from three miles away and which was carried 
to him by the winds. When he was on the verge of [entering] their valley, he [Solomon] made his ho£ts 
halt until they [the ants] had entered their dwellings — on this journey his ho£ts consisted of cavalry and 
infantry. And he said, ‘My Lord, inspire me to be thankful for Your grace with which You have favoured 
me and my parents, and to do good that will please You, and include me, by Your mercy, among Your 
righteous servants’, the prophets and saints.","We gave David and Solomon knowledge, and they said, “All praise be to Allah, Who has favored us[5] over many of His believing slaves.” . Solomon succeeded David, and said, “O people, we have been taught the speech of birds, and we have been given from all things. This is indeed a clear favor.” . Solomon’s armies of jinn, men and birds were assembled before him, marching in organized ranks, . until when they reached a valley of ants, an ant said, “O ants, get into your dwellings, so Solomon and his armies do not crush you unknowingly.” . So he smiled in amusement at its words and said, “My Lord, inspire me to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and my parents, and to do righteous deeds that please you. And admit me, by Your mercy, among Your righteous slaves.”","[5] They were privileged by prophethood, the ability to communicate with animals and birds, control the wind, use the jinn for their service, etc."
27,20,28,"And he reviewed the birds, to see the hoopoe — which would locate water beneath the ground 
and indicate its location by pecking at it, whereupon the devils would extract it, for Solomon required it 
for when he prayed; but he could not see him — then he said, ‘Why is it that I do not see the hoopoe?, 
in other words, is there something preventing me from seeing him? Or is he among the absent?, and so I 
cannot see him because he is absent?’ And when he became certain [of the hoopoe’s absence], He said, ‘Assuredly I will chaflise him with a severe chaflisement, by having [all] his feathers 
as well as his tail plucked and leaving him out in the sun, where he would not be able to escape from 
reptiles, or I will slaughter him, by slitting his throat, unless he brings me (read la-ya’tiyanni or la- 
ya’tinanm) a clear warrant’, plain manifest proof for his [having a valid] excuse. But he did not remain (read fa-makutha or fa-makatha) long [in absence], in other words, [he 
was away only] for a short while, and came to Solomon humbly, with his head up and his wings and tail 
lowered. Solomon pardoned him and asked him about what he had encountered during his absence: and 
he said, ‘I have discovered something of which you have no knowledge, and I have brought you from

Sheba (this may be read in declined form [min Saba in] or left as indeclinable [min Saba’a ]) — a tribe 
in Yemen, whose name is taken from the name of one of their ancestors (which is also the reason why it 
may be declined) — a verified report. I found a woman ruling over them, in other words, she was their queen, her name Bilqis; and 
she has been given [an abundance] of all things, that kings might require, in the way of machines and 
instruments, and she possesses a great throne — its length was 80 cubits, its width 40 cubits, its height 
30 cubits, and was made of gold and silver, encruSted with pearls, rubies, chrysolite, and emeralds, 
with its legs made of rubies, chrysolite and emeralds, containing seven [inner] doors, the door of each 
chamber shut. I found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of God, and Satan has adorned 
for them their deeds and he has barred them from the Way, from the path of truth, so that they 
are not guided to prostrate themselves to God (alia yasjudu should be read as anyasjudu: the la is extra and with 
it has been assimilated the nun of an, similar to [the construction] where God says, li-alld yalama ahlu’l-

of yahtaduna, ‘guided’, whose ild, ‘to’, has been omitted); [He] Who brings forth the hidden (al-khab’ is 
a verbal noun, with the same meaning as al-makhbu, ‘that which is hidden) of rain and plants, in the 
heavens and the earth, and He knows what they conceal, within their hearts, and what they proclaim, 
with their tongues. 2 God — there is no god except Him, the Lord of the Mighty Throne’ (this clause constitutes an 
[independent] new sentence, which is a eulogy comprising [praise of] the Throne of the Compassion¬ 
ate One to counter the [description of the] throne of Bilqis: between the two, however, is an unfathom¬ 
able difference). He, Solomon, said, to the hoopoe: ‘We shall see whether you have Spoken the truth, in what you 
have informed us, or whether you are of the liars, that is, of their ilk — for [to say] that is rhetorically 
more powerful than [simply] saying ‘or whether you have lied’. He [the hoopoe] indicated to them the 
place of the water and it was extracted. They thus drank, performed their ablutions and prayed. Solomon 
then composed a letter in the following form: ‘From the servant of God, Solomon son of David, to Bilqis, 
Queen of Sheba. In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful: Peace be upon those who fol¬ 
low Guidance. To wit: do not rise up against me [in defiance], but come to me in submission. He then 
stamped it with musk and sealed it with his ring, and said to the hoopoe: Take this letter of mine and deliver it to them, that is, to Bilqis and her people, then turn away, 
withdraw, from them, but remain close by them, and see what [response] they shall return’, [and see] 
what kind of response they shall give. Thus, he took it and approached her [Bilqis]. But as her soldiers 
were all around her, he cast it into her private chamber. When she saw it, she shuddered and was con¬ 
sumed by fear. She read what it said.","Once he checked the birds, and said, “Why is it that I do not see the hoopoe – or is he among the absent? . I will surely punish him severely, or slaughter him, unless he brings me a valid reason.” . It was not long before the hoopoe came and said, “I have learned something that you do not know; I come to you from Sheba with sure news. . I found a woman[6] ruling over them, who has been given of all things, and she has a great throne. . I found her and her people prostrating before the sun instead of Allah. Satan has made their deeds appealing to them and turned them away from the right way, so they are not guided. . so that they do not prostrate before Allah Who brings forth what is hidden in the heavens and earth, and Who knows all that you conceal and all that you reveal. . Allah; none has the right to be worshiped except Him, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.” . Solomon said, “We will see whether you have told the truth or you are one of the liars. . Take this letter of mine and deliver it to them, then withdraw and see how they respond.”","[6] Known as Bilqīs, the Queen of Sheba."
27,29,37,"Then, she said, to the noblemen of her people: ‘O [ members of the] council, lo! (read yd ayyuha’l- 
mala’u inni, pronouncing [in the laft two words] both hamzas; or by not pronouncing the second one 
and changing it into a wdw with kasra vowelling) a noble, a sealed, letter has been delivered to me. It is from Solomon and lo! it is, in other words, its text says: “In the Name of God, the Compas¬

words, guide me, in this matter of mine. I never decide on a matter, I never conclude it, until you 
are present’. They said, ‘We possess force and we possess great might, in other words, we are hardy in war. The 
matter is for you [ to decide]. So see what you will command’, us, and we will obey you. She said, ‘Indeed kings, when they enter a town, ruin it, with destruction, and reduce the 
mightiest of its inhabitants to the moil abased. That is what they too will do, namely, the senders of 
this letter. Now I will send them a gift and wait to see with what [response] the envoys return’, in the way 
of accepting the gift or rejecting it. If it be a king [to whom we have sent it], he will accept it; but if it be 
a prophet, he will rejecft it. Thus, she sent male and female servants, one thousand in total, together with 
five hundred bricks of gold, a crown Studded with jewels, and musk, ambergris and other things with an 
envoy carrying a letter. The hoopoe thus hurried back to bring the news to Solomon, who ordered bricks 
of gold and silver to be made and laid out across a [vaSt] square the distance of nine parasangs from his 
seat and for a towering wall of gold and silver to be constructed around it, and for the moSt Splendid 
creatures of the land and the sea, together with the children of the jinn, to be brought to line the right 
and left sides of the square. But when he, the envoy, came to Solomon, with the gift and the servants, he said, ‘Areyou sup¬ 
plying me with wealth? What God has given me, of prophethood and kingship, is better than what He 
has given you, of [the things of] this world. Nay, but it is you [and not I] who exult in your gift, foryou 
pride yourselves upon [the possession of] the ornaments of this world! Go back to them, with the gifts that you have brought, for We shall assuredly come to them with 
hoSts which they will not be able to face and we shall expel them from there, from the land of Sheba 
(Saba’) — named [thus] after their tribal ancestor — humiliated, and they shall be utterly abased’, un¬ 
less they come to me in submission. When the envoy returned to her with the gift, she had her throne 
placed inside seven doors inside her palace, with her palace inside seven palaces, and had all the doors 
locked with guards at them. She then prepared to make the journey to Solomon to see what he would 
command her. She departed with twelve thousand chieftains ( qayl ), each accompanied by thousands [of 
men] until when she came to within a parasang of him, he sensed her [arrival].","The Queen said, “O chiefs, a noble letter has been delivered to me. . It is from Solomon, and it reads, ‘In the name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful. . Do not be arrogant towards me, but come to me in full submission.” . She said, “O chiefs, advise me in this matter of mine, for I would make no decision without your consent[7].” . They said, “We are powerful and great fighters, but the decision is yours, so consider what you will command.” . She said, “When kings enter a town, they ravage it and humiliate its notables; this is what they really do. . But I will send them a gift, then see with what response the envoys will return[8].” . When the envoy came to Solomon, he said, “Do you seek to appease me with wealth? What Allah has given me is far better than what He has given you. Rather, it is you who take pleasure in gifts. . Go back to them; we will surely come to them with forces that they cannot resist, and we will surely drive them out therefrom in disgrace, fully humbled[9].”",[7] Or without your presence to hear from you. . [8] She wanted to see whether Solomon was a true prophet or only a king who would be satisfied with a tribute. . [9] In case they refused to submit.
27,38,44,"He said, ‘O [members of the] council, which of you (regarding the two hamzas read them in the 
way mentioned above [verse 32]) will bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?’, com¬ 
pliant and obedient? For I may only [rightfully] seize it before this [submission] and not afterwards. An afreet from among the jinn — a [jinn who is] powerful and stalwart — said, ‘I will bring it 
to you before you rise from your place, the one in which you sit when adjudicating — the period from 
morning to midday. Indeed I have the Strength for it, that is, for carrying it, and I am trustworthy’, 
over what it may contain of jewels and other [precious] things. Solomon said, T want something faster 
than that!’ 77 ie one who had knowledge of the, revealed. Scripture — and this was [one] Asif b. Barkhiya, a 
righteous individual with knowledge of God’s Great eft Name, which when invoked [in supplication] for 
something it is [immediately] granted — said: ‘I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you, 
after you look at something. So he [the afreet] said to him, ‘Look up towards the heaven’, which he did, 
and when his glance returned [in front of him] he found it [Bilqls’ throne] placed before him — for in 
the instance in which Solomon looked up to the heaven, Asif supplicated by invoking the Greatest Name 
that God bring it [thereto]; and this was done by having it travel under the earth until it ^rung up below 
Solomon’s seat ( kursi ). Then, when he saw it Standing, ftill, before him, he said, ‘This, bringing it to me, 
is of my Lord’s bounty, that He may try me, teft me, whether I give thanks (read a-ashkur, pronouncing 
both hamzas; or by replacing the second one with an alif; or by not pronouncing the second one, but 
inserting an alif between the one not pronounced and the other one or without [the insertion]) or am 
ungrateful, for the favour. And whoever gives thanks, gives thanks only for his own sake, because the

reward for his thanks shall be his, and whoever is ungrateful, for the favour, [should know] then my 
Lord is surely Independent, with no need of his thanks, Generous’, by being bounteous to those who are 
ungrateful for it. He said, ‘Disguise her throne for her — in other words, transform it such that when she sees it, it 
will be in an unrecognisable form — that we may see whether she will be guided, to recognising it, or be 
of those who cannot be guided’, to recognise when things are transformed around them. He [Solomon] 
sought thereby to teSt her mind, for it was said to have something wrong with it. Thus they transformed 
it by adding or taking away [certain things] and in other ways. So when she came, it was said, to her: ‘Is your throne like this?’ She said, ‘It as though it is the 
one’. She had, in facft, recognised it; but she made a pretence to them juSt as they made a pretence to her, 
given that [when she was asked about the throne] it was not said, ‘Is this your throne?’, for had it been so, 
she would have replied, ‘Yes, it is’. When Solomon realised that she was perceptive and knowledgeable, 
he said: ‘And we were given the knowledge before her and we had submitted [to God]. And what she worshipped besides God, that is, other than Him, barred her, from the worship of 
God, for she belonged to disbelieving folk’. It was, also, said to her, ‘Enter the palace [hallway]’ — this was a transparent white glass floor 
underneath which flowed sweet water that contained fish. Solomon had it made when he was told that 
her legs and feet resembled the shanks of a mule. And when she saw it, she supposed it to be a pool, of 
water, and so she bared her legs, to wade through it. Meanwhile Solomon was seated on his throne at 
the front part of the palace [hallway], and he saw that her legs and feet were [in facft] fair. He said, to her: 
‘It is a hallway paved [smooth] with crystal’, and thereafter he called her to submit [to God]. She said, 
‘My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, by worshipping other than You, and I submit with Solomon 
to God, the Lord of the Worlds’. He wanted to marry her but disliked the hair on her legs. So the devils 
made a [depilatory] lime mixture ( nura ) and she removed it therewith. He married her and had [great] 
love for her. And he let her remain as ruler of her kingdom and would visit her once a month, Staying 
for three days [every time]. Her reign came to an end at the same time as that of Solomon. It is reported 
that he became king at the age of 13 and died at the age of 53 — Glory be to the One whose enduring 
sovereignty will never end!","He said, “O chiefs, which one of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?” . A powerful jinn said, “I will bring it to you before you rise up from your council, and I am strong enough and trustworthy.” . But the one who had some knowledge of the scripture[10] said, “I will bring it to you in the blink of your eye.” When he saw it placed before him, he said, “This is a favor of my Lord, to test me whether I will be grateful or ungrateful. Whoever is grateful, it is only for his own good; and whoever is ungrateful, then my Lord is Self-Sufficient, Most Generous.” . He said, “Disguise her throne for her, so we may see whether she can discover the truth, or she will be of those who cannot recognize.” . So when she came, she was asked, “Is your throne like this?” She said, “It looks as if it is the same. We were given knowledge beforehand[11], and have submitted [to Allah].” . But she was hindered [from the faith] because she used to worship other than Allah, for she came from a disbelieving people. . It was said to her, “Enter the palace.” But when she saw it, she thought it was a body of water[13], so she uncovered her calves. He said, “This is a palace paved with crystal.” She said, “My Lord, I have wronged myself, and now I submit along with Solomon to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.”","[10] i.e., A man of righteousness and knowledge of the scripture who also knew Allah's Magnificent Name (Al-’Ism Al-‘Azam), by Which if supplication was made would be answered. . [11] Because he had refused our tribute sent to him, or we had known about his kingdom and authority before seeing this sign of bringing the throne from this long distance. Or ""We were given knowledge beforehand"" was Prophet Solomon’s statement, which means: We were given knowledge beforehand that she will come submitting to Allah, and we were submissive and obedient to Allah Almighty. . [13] The floor of the palace was transparent, under which was flowing water."
27,45,53,"And verily We sent to Thamud their brother, in terms of [his belonging to the same] tribe, Salih, 
with the following [decree]: ‘Worship God!’, affirm His Oneness. And lo! they [then] became two par¬ 
ties quarrelling with one another, over religion, one party having become believers upon his arrival as 
messenger to them and the other party disbelievers. He said, to the deniers: ‘O my people, why do you [seek to] hasten on evil before [seeking] good?, 
in other words, [why do you seek to haSten on] chastisement instead of mercy, when you say, ‘If what you 
bring us is true, then bring us the chastisement!’ Why do you not ask God to forgive you, [your] idolatry, 
so that you might be shown mercy?’, and not be chastised. They said, ‘We augur evil (ittayyarna is acftually tatayyarna, but the td’has been assimilated with 
the ta, and a conjunctive hamza added) of you and of those who are with you’, namely, the believers — 
when they [the tribe of Thamud] were deprived of rain and suffered hunger. He said, ‘Your evil augury 
is with God — He has given it to you; nay, but you are a people being tried’, being teSted with good and 
evil [turns of fortune]. And there were in the city, the city of Thamud, a band of nine men, that is, [nine] men, who 
were causing corruption in the land, with acfts of disobedience, which included their corroding of 
dinar and dirham coins [rendering them worthless], and did not reform [their ways], through obedi¬ 
ence [to God]. They said, that is, some said to others, ‘Swear to one another by God that we will attack him by 
night ( la-nubayyitannahu ; or [read] la-tubayyitunnahu, ‘that you will attack him by night’) together with

we will surely say ( la-naqulanna ; or [read] la-taqiilunna, ‘you surely will say’) to his heir, the avenger of 
his blood, that we did not witness, we were not present at, the destruction of his folk (read muhlika or 
mahlika, meaning ‘the destroying of them’ or ‘their death’ [respectively]), 3 and so we do not know who 
killed them, and [that] indeed we are being truthful’. So they plotted, thereby, a plot, but We [also] plotted a plot, in other words, We requited them 
by hastening on their punishment, while they were not aware. So behold how was the consequence of their plot! For lo! We destroyed them and all their peo¬ 
ple, with Gabriel’s cry, or by the angels’ pelting them with Stones, which they could see even though they 
could not see them [the angels]. So those then are their houses [lying] deserted ( khawiyatan is in the accusative because it is a cir¬ 
cumstantial qualifier, the operator of which is the import of the demonstrative pronoun [tilka, ‘those’]) 
because of the evil which they did, that is, their disbelief. Surely in that there is a sign, a lesson, for a 
people who have knowledge, of Our power and are thus admonished. And We delivered those who believed, in Salih — and they numbered 4,000 — and were fearful, 
of idolatry.","We sent to the people of Thamūd their brother Sālih [saying], “Worship Allah,” then they suddenly split into two quarreling factions[14]. . He said, “O my people, why do you seek to hasten punishment rather than good?[15] If only you sought Allah’s forgiveness, so that you may be shown mercy!” . They said, “We consider you and those who are with you as a bad omen.” He said, “Your omen is from Allah, but you are a people who are being tested.” . There were nine men in the city who used to spread corruption in the land without doing anything good. . They said, “Let us all swear by Allah that we will kill him and his family by night. Then we will tell his heir[16], ‘We did not witness the murder of his family, and we are indeed truthful.’” . Thus they made a plan and We too made a plan, but they were unaware of it. . See then what was the consequences of their plan: We destroyed them and their entire people. . Now their houses are utterly ruined because of their wrongdoing. Indeed, there are signs in this for people of knowledge. . And We saved those who believed and feared Allah.","[14] i.e., believers and non-believers. . [15] They challenged Sālih to bring them the punishment rather than asking for mercy from Allah. . [16] i.e., the one who executes his will and avenges his blood."

you are truly a people in ignorance’, of the consequence of your acftion. Butthe only response of his people was that they said, ‘Expel Lot’s family from your town. They 
are indeed a folk who [prefer to] remain pure!’, from [coming unto] the rears of men. So We delivered him and his family, except his wife — We decreed [for] her. We made her by 
Our decree, to be of those who remained behind, in the chastisement. Then We rained on them a rain — these were the Stones of baked mud [cf. Q. 15:74] — 
which destroyed them. And evil indeed was, their rain, the rain of those who were warned, againSt 
chastisement.","And [remember] Lot, when he said to his people, “Do you commit this shameful act[17] while seeing [one another][18]? . Do you approach men with lust instead of women? In fact, you are an ignorant people!” . But the only response his people gave was to say, “Drive the family of Lot out of your town, for they are a people who keep themselves pure!” . So We saved him and his family, except his wife whom We destined to be among those who would remain behind. . And We rained upon them a rain [of stones]. How terrible was the rain of those who were warned!","[17] i.e., sodomy.
 [18] i.e., publicly, or while you are aware [that it is wrong]."
27,59,66,"Say, O Muhammad (s): ‘Praise be to God, for the destruction of the disbelievers of paSt com¬ 
munities, and peace be on His servants whom He has chosen’. Is God (read a-Allahu, pronouncing both 
hamzas; or by substituting an alif for the second one; or by not pronouncing the second one but inserting 
an alif between the one not pronounced and the other one or without [such an insertion]) better, for 
those who worship Him, or the partners which they ascribe? (read [either] tushrikuna, ‘you ascribe’, or 
yushrikuna, ‘they ascribe’), [they being] the people of Mecca, [the partners they ascribe] to Him, in other 
words, are such gods better for those who worship them? Or He Who created the heavens and the earth, and sends down for you water from the heaven, 
whereby We cause to grow (there is a shift here from third person to that of the firSt person [plural]) 
splendid gardens (hadaiq is the plural of hadiqa, which is an enclosed garden) whose trees you could 
never cause to grow?, because of you do not have the ability for it. Is there a god (a-ilahun, here and in 
the seven instances in which it occurs, read by pronouncing both hamzas, or by not pronouncing the 
second, inserting an alif between the two in both cases) with God?, who has helped Him in [all of] this? 

3 The purpose of this gloss is to point out that if it is read muhlik then it derives from the 4 th form ahlaka (‘he caused the destruction 
[of another]’), and that if it is read mahlik then it derives from the i fl form halaka (‘he died’).

In other words, there is no god with Him. Nay, but they are a people who ascribe equals [to Him], who 
associate with God others. Or He Who made the earth an abode [of Stability], that does not [constantly] shake beneath 
[the feet of] its inhabitants, and made rivers [ to flow] throughout it and set firm mountains for it, with 
which He fixed the earth [in place], and set an ifthmus between the two seas, between the sweet one and 
the salty one, the one not mixing with the other. Is there a god with God? Nay, but mo SI of them have 
no knowledge, of His Oneness. Or He Who answers the desperate one, the anguished person suffering harm, when he calls to 
Him and Who removes [his] distress, from him and from others, and makes you successors in the earth 
(the annexation [khulafaa l-ardi, ‘successors of the earth’] has the same meaning as/f, ‘in’ [khulafaafil- 
ardi, ‘successors in the earth’]), in other words, each generation succeeding the one before it. Is there a 
god with God? Little do you remember, [little] are you admonished ([read] ma tadhakkaruna, ‘do you 
remember’; or [read] yadhdhakkaruna, ‘do they remember’, where [in both cases] the ta has been as¬ 
similated with the dhal; the ma is extra, [used] to make less what is already ‘little’). Or He Who guides you, shows you the way to your destinations, in the darkness of the land and 
the sea, by the Stars at night, and by [the various] landmarks during the day, and Who sends forth the 
winds as harbingers of His mercy, ahead of the rain. Is there a god with God? Exalted be God [high] 
above what, others, they associate, with Him! Or He Who originates creation, in the wombs, from a SJierni-drop, then brings it back again, 
after death, as established by the proofs for this [resurrection], even if you do not acknowledge it; and 
Who provides for you from the heaven, rain, and [from] the earth, vegetation. Is there a god with God? 
In other words, none of the things mentioned is done by anyone other than God, and there is no god 
with Him. Say, O Muhammad (s): ‘Produce your proof, your definitive argument, if you are truthful’, 
about their being a god with Me who has done any of the things mentioned. They [the disbelievers] also asked him when the Hour will come to pass, and the following was 
revealed: Say: ‘No one in the heavens or the earth knows, be it angels or human beings, the Unseen, 
namely, what is hidden from them, except God, He knows it, and they are not aware, the disbelievers of 
Mecca, like others, when, is the time in which, they will be resurrected. Nay, has their knowledge come to comprise (read adraka, similar to the [4 th verbal] form akra- 
ma, ‘he was kind to’; a variant reading has iddaraka, which is actually tadaraka, with the ta changed into 
a dal and assimilated with the [other] dal, and a conjunctive hamza added, meaning, ‘attained’ or ‘caught 
up with’) the Hereafter?, such that they [have reason to] ask about the time of its coming — not so: Nay, 
for they are in doubt of it. Rather they are blind to it (' amuna, ‘blind’, as in blindness of the heart; this 
[Statement] is rhetorically more powerful than the preceding one; the origin [of the term] is ‘amiyun, 
but the damma vowel is deemed too heavy for the ya and has been moved to the mim, after dropping 
its kasra vowel).","Say, [O Prophet], “All praise is for Allah, and peace be upon His slaves whom He has chosen. Is Allah better, or those partners whom they associate with Him?” . Is He [not better] Who created the heavens and earth, and sent down for you rain from the sky, by which We caused to grow gardens of cheerful beauty? You could never cause their trees to grow. Is there any god besides Allah? No, but they are people who ascribe equals [to Allah]. . Is He [not better] Who made the earth a stable place to live, and caused rivers to flow through it, and placed therein firm mountains, and made a barrier between two flowing bodies of water[19]? Is there any god besides Allah? No, but most of them do not know. . Is He [not better] Who responds to the distressed when he calls out to Him, and Who relieves suffering, and Who makes you successors[20] on earth? Is there any god besides Allah? Little is it that you take heed! . Is He [not better] Who guides you in the depths of the darkness of the land and sea[21], and Who sends the winds as harbingers ahead of His mercy[22]? Is there any god besides Allah? Exalted is Allah far above the partners they associate with Him! . Is He [not better] Who originates creation then repeats it, and Who gives you provision from the heaven and earth? Is there any god besides Allah? Say, “Produce your evidence, if you are truthful.” . Say, “No one in the heavens and earth has knowledge of the unseen except Allah.” Nor do they know when they will be resurrected. . In fact, their knowledge cannot comprehend the Hereafter; rather, they are in doubt about it; rather, they are blind to it.","[19] See footnote 25:53. . [20] One generation after another generation. . [21] Through the stars, constellations, and landmarks. [22] i.e., the rain."
27,67,75,"And the disbelievers say, also in rejecting the [idea of] resurrection: ‘What! When we and our 
fathers are duft shall we indeed be brought forth [again]?, from the graves. Already we and our fathers have been promised this before. [But] these are juft the [legendary] 
fables of the ancients’ ( asdtir is the plural of ustura, meaning ‘what has been written down [ma sutira] 
of lies’). Say: ‘Travel in the land and see how was the sequel for the criminals’, because of their denials 
— and this [sequel] is that they were destroyed with punishment. And do not grieve for them, and do not be diftressed by their schemes — this is meant to comfort 
the Prophet (s), in other words, do not be concerned with their plotting against you, for We will grant 
you victory over them.

Sura al-Naml And they say, ‘When will this promise, of chastisement, be, if you are truthful?’, regarding it. Say: ‘It may be that part of what you seek to hasten on is close behind you’ — so they were slain 
at Badr and the remaining chastisement will come to them after death. And surely your Lord is bountiful to mankind, an example of which is His deferring chastise¬ 
ment for the disbelievers, but moil of them are not thankfid — disbelievers are not grateful for the defer¬ 
ring of chastisement since they rejeCt [the facft] that it will ever come to pass. And surely your Lord knows what their hearts conceal, [what these] hide, and what they pro¬ 
claim, by their tongues. And there is not a thing hidden in the heaven and the earth (the ha [ta marbuta] of ghaibatun 
is hyperbole, in other words, anything that is completely hidden from people) but it is in a manifest 
Book, namely, [in] the Preserved Tablet ( al-lawh al-mahfuz ) and in God’s concealed knowledge, an ex¬ 
ample of which is the [time of the] chastising of the disbelievers.","Those who disbelieve say, “What! Is it that when we and our forefathers become dust, will we really be brought forth [alive]? . We and our forefathers have been promised this before; this is nothing but ancient fables!” . Say, “Travel in the land and see how was the end of the wicked.” . Do not grieve over them, nor be distressed by their plots. . They say, “When will this warning come to pass, if you are truthful?” . Say, “Perhaps some of what you seek to hasten is quite near to you.” . Indeed, your Lord is graceful to mankind[23], but most of them are ungrateful. . Your Lord surely knows all that their hearts conceal and all that they reveal[24]. . For there is nothing hidden in the heavens and earth except that it is [written] in a clear Record[25].","[23] As He delays their punishment and grants them respite to repent. .

expounds the said [differences] as they should be, eliminating any disagreements between them, if only 
they were to implement it and submit [to its prescriptions]. And truly it is a guidance, from error, and a mercy for believers, from chastisement. Surely your Lord will decide between them, as [He will] with others on the Day of Resurrection, 
of His judgement, that is, His justice. And He is the Mighty, the Vicftor, the Knower, of what He judges, 
so that none will be able to oppose Him in the way that the disbelievers have opposed His prophets in 
this world.","Indeed, this Qur’an explains to the Children of Israel most of that over which they differ. . And it is certainly a guidance and mercy for the believers. . Indeed, your Lord will judge between them by His justice, for He is the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing.",

truth from falsehood. We will recount, narrate, to you [something] of the tale of Moses and Pharaoh truthfully, for a 
people who believe, for their sake, since they are the ones to benefit from such [an account]. Truly Pharaoh had exalted himself in the land, the land of Egypt, and reduced its people into 
setts, groups, to serve him, oppressing a group of them, namely, the Children of Israel, slaughtering their 
sons, the new-born, and sparing their women, keeping them alive — for some of the [Egyptian] priests 
had told him, ‘A new-born of the Children of Israel shall bring about the end of your kingdom’. Indeed

and Haman and their hoSts might see’, with all three [nouns] in the nominative) from them that of which 
they were apprehensive, [that which] they feared of the new-born [Israelite] who would bring about the 
end of their kingdom.","Tā Sīn Mīm.[1] . These are the verses of the clear Book. . We recount to you part of the story of Moses and Pharaoh in truth for people who believe. . Indeed, Pharaoh arrogantly elevated himself in the land and divided its people into different factions; oppressing one group of them[2], slaughtering their sons and sparing their women alive[3]. He was truly one of those who spread corruption. . But We wanted to bestow favor upon those who were oppressed in the land[4], and make them leaders and inheritors [of the land], . and to establish them in the land, and to show Pharaoh, Hāmān[5] and their soldiers[6] that which they feared[7].","[1] See footnote 2:1. .

28,7,13,"And We revealed, by inspiration or in a dream, to the mother of Moses — who was the said new¬ 
born; his siSter was the only other person aware of his birth — ‘Suckle him, then, when you fear for him, 
caft him into the waters, namely, the Nile, and do not fear, that he should drown, or grieve, for being 
separated from him, for We will restore him to you and make him one of the messengers’. She suckled 
him for three months during which he never cried. She then began to fear for him and so she placed him 
in a basket coated with pitch and made as a cradle for him on the inside. She then closed it and caSt it 
into the waters of the Nile at night. Then Pharaoh’s folk, aids, picked him up, with him [Still] in the basket, the morning following 
that night — it was placed him in front of him [Pharaoh] and then opened and Moses was brought out 
of it, sucking milk from his thumb — to be, at the end of the affair, an enemy, slaying their menfolk, and 
a [cause of] grief to them, enslaving their womenfolk (a variant reading [for hazanan] is huznan, both 
of which are alternative forms of the verbal noun, and it functions as an acftive participle, derived from 
hazanahu, which is like ahzanahu, ‘he caused him grief’). Truly Pharaoh and, his minister, Haman, and 
their hofts were sinners, that is, disobedient, and so they were punished at his [Moses’s] hands. And Pharaoh’s wife said, after he and his aids had resolved to slay him: he is, ‘A joyous sight for 
me and you. Do not slay him. Perhaps he will be of benefit to us, or we will adopt him as a son’, and so 
they obeyed her [wish]. And they were not aware, of the sequel to their affair with him. And the heart of Moses’s mother, when she found out that they had picked him up, became 
empty, of everything other than him. Indeed (in, softened from the hardened form, its subjecft omitted,

not fortified her heart, with patience, that is, We made it at peace, that she might be of the believers, [of] 
those who have faith in Gods promise (the response to [the conditional] lawld, ‘had ... not’, is given by 
the preceding [Statement]). And she said to his sifter, Mary, ‘Follow him’, in other words, follow where he goes in order to 
find out his news. So she watched him from afar, from a distance, secretly, while they were not aware, 
that she was his siSter, or that she was [even] watching him. And We had forbidden him to [take to the breads ofJ fodermothers from before, that is to say, 
we prevented him from taking to the breaSts of any suckling mother other than his own mother. There¬ 
fore he would not accept the breaSts of any of the foSter-mothers brought for him. So she, his siSter, said, 
‘Shall I show you a household — having seen their affecftion for him — who will take care of him for you, 
by having him suckled and so on, and who will ad in good faith towards him?’ (the [suffixed] pronoun 
in lahu has been interpreted as referring to the king, as a response to them [when they asked Mary how 
she could be sure]). Her suggestion was accepted. So she brought his mother and he took to her breaSt. 
She explained to them that he had taken to her [breaSt] because of her pleasant scent and the wholesome 
taSte of her milk. Permission was given to her to breaSt-feed him in her own house and so she returned 
with him, juSt as God, exalted be He, says: Thus We redored him to his mother so that her eyes might delight, in seeing him [again], and 
not grieve, thereat, and that she might know that God’s promise, to restore him to her, is true; but mod 
of them, that is, the people, do not know, about this promise, or of the fad that this was his siSter and the 
other was his mother. He [Moses] remained with her until he was weaned during which time she was 
paid wages at one dinar per day. She took this because it was money from enemy territory ( harbi ). 2 She 
then brought him [back] to Pharaoh in whose household he was raised, as God recounts of him in surat 
al-Shuara [Q. 26:18], Did we not rear you among us as a child, and did you not day with us for years of 
your life?","We inspired the mother of Moses, “Suckle him; but when you fear for him, cast him into the river, and do not fear or grieve. We will surely return him to you, and will make him one of the messengers.” . Then the household of Pharaoh picked him up, so that he may become an enemy to them and a source of grief. Indeed, Pharaoh, Hāmān and their soldiers were wrongdoers. . Pharaoh’s wife said, “He is a source of joy for me and you. Do not kill him; he will probably benefit us, or we may adopt him as a son.” They were unaware [of the consequences]. . The heart of Moses’ mother became restless; she was about to disclose it, had We not reassured her heart so that she would maintain her faith [in Allah’s promise]. . She said to his sister, “Keep track of him.” So she watched him from a distance, without them noticing. . We had already forbidden for him all wet nurses[8], then she said, “Shall I direct you to a household who will nurse him for you and take good care of him?” . Then We returned him to his mother so that she would be comforted and not grieve, and so that she would know that Allah’s promise is true. Yet most of them do not know.",[8] Moses had refused to nurse from any other woman.
28,14,19,"And when he came of age, namely, at 30 or 33, and [then] was [fidly] mature, that is, when he 
reached the age of 40, We gave him judgement, wisdom, and knowledge, comprehension of religious 
matters before he was sent as a prophet. And so, just as We rewarded him, do We reward those are virtu¬ 
ous, to their own souls. And he, Moses, entered the city. Pharaohs city, Memphis, having been absent from it for a while, 
at a time when its people were oblivious, the time of the afternoon nap, and found therein two men 
fighting, one of his own faction, namely, an Israelite, and the other of his enemies, in other words, an 
Egyptian, who was exploiting an Israelite to carry firewood to Pharaoh’s kitchen. So the one who was 
of his fadion called to him for help againd the one who was of his enemies, and so Moses said to him, 
‘Leave him be!’, and it is said that he replied to Moses [thus]: ‘I am truly considering making you carry 
this [firewood]!’. So Moses punched him, that is, he hit him with his fid clenched — he [Moses] was a 
strong man with a powerful strike, and did away with him, that is, he killed him, but he had not in¬ 
tended to kill him. He buried him in the sand. He said, ‘This, killing of him, is of Satan’s doing, inciting 
my anger. Indeed he is an enemy, to the son of Adam, a manifed misleader’, of him. He said, remorsefully, ‘My Lord, I have indeed wronged myself, by killing him, so forgive me!’ 
So He forgave him. Truly He is the Forgiving, the Merciful, that is to say, the One Who has always pos¬ 
sessed, and will always possess, these two attributes. He said, ‘My Lord, forasmuch as You have been gracious to me, with forgiveness, protect me 
[so], I will never be a partisan, a supporter, of the criminals’, the disbelievers henceforth, if you were to 
proted me. 

2 The term harbi refers to dar al-hdrb, ‘enemy territory’, as opposed to dar al-islam. A non-Muslim, who is not protected by a treaty 
(such as Jews and Christians etc.), is regarded as being in a State of war with Muslims and so both his life and his property are 
unprotected. The suggestion is that the family of Moses, being the Muslims of that time, were living within enemy territory.

Tafsir al-Jalalayn In the morning he was in the city, fearful, vigilant, waiting to see what would happen to him 
[in reaction] from the side of the slain man; — when behold, the one who had sought his help the day 
before cried out to him for help [again], asking for his help against another Egyptian. Moses said to him, 
‘Clearly you are a trouble-maker!’, whose trouble-making is evident, judging by what you did yesterday 
and today. But when (fa-lamma an: an is extra) he was about to fitrike the man who was an enemy to both 
of them, to Moses and the one seeking his help, he, the one seeking help, supposing that Moses was about 
to strike him, because of what he [Moses] had said to him, said: ‘O Moses, do you want to slay me juft 
as you slew a soul yesterday? You merely want to be a tyrant in the land, and you do not want to be of 
the reformers’. The Egyptian heard this and realised that the slayer had been Moses. Thus he hurried off 
to Pharaoh to inform him of this. Pharaoh then ordered slaughterers to slay Moses, and they set off in 
his direcftion.","When he reached his full strength and maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. This is how We reward those who do good. . Once he entered the city unnoticed by its people[9], and found two men fighting: one of his own people and the other of his enemies. The one from his own people called him for help against his enemy, so Moses struck him with his fist, causing his death. Moses said, “This is of Satan’s work; he is a sworn enemy who mislead people.” . He said, “My Lord, I have wronged myself, so forgive me,” Then He forgave him, for He is indeed the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. . He said, “My Lord, because of the blessings that You have bestowed upon me, I will never be a supporter of the wicked.” . Then he became fearful and vigilant in the city; suddenly the one who sought his help the day before cried out to him again for help. Moses said to him, “You are clearly a troublemaker.” . When he was about to strike the one who was an enemy to both of them, he[10] said, “O Moses, do you want to kill me as you killed that person yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land, and you do not want to be one of those who put things right!”","[9] i.e., as it was the time of rest at noon. . [10] i.e., the Israelite thought that Moses wanted to strike him."
28,20,21,"And a man, who was the [only] believer among Pharaoh’s kinsfolk, came from the outskirts of 
the city, hastening, walking fast, via a route quicker than theirs. He said, ‘O Moses, lo! the council, of 
Pharaoh’s folk, are conspiring, discussing [the means], to slay you. So leave, the city. Trtdy I am Speaking 
to you in good faith’, in bidding you to leave. So he departed from it, fearful, vigilant, ledl any of the pursuers catch up with him, or [in 
the hope] that God might rescue him. He said, ‘My Lord, deliver me from the evildoing people’. 
Pharaoh’s people.","Then there came a man rushing from the farthest end of the city, and said, “O Moses, the chiefs are conspiring to kill you, so leave. I am giving you sincere advice.” . So he left the city, fearful and vigilant. He said, “My Lord, save me from the wrongdoing people.”",
28,22,28,"And when he turned his face towards Midian, in the direcftion thereof — and this [Midian] was 
the town of [the prophet] Shu'ayb, eight day’s journeying from Egypt, [so] named after Midian son of 
Abraham; he [Moses] did not know the route to it — he said, ‘Perhaps my Lord will show me the right 
way’, that is to say, which route to follow, in other words, the simplest route to it. God thus sent forth to 
him an angel with a goat, which he [Moses] set off following towards it [the town]. And when he arrived at the Water of Midian, [the name of] a well therein, he found a group of 
people there watering, their flocks, and he found, besides them, two women holding back their flock, 
from the water. He, Moses, said, to the two: ‘What is your business?’, that is, ‘What is the matter with 
you, that you are not watering?’ They said, ‘We do not water [ourflock] until the shepherds have moved 
on (nau, ‘shepherds’, the plural of rain ) that is to say, until they have returned from the watering, for 
fear of being crushed [by the throng], after which we go to water (a variant reading [for yasdiru, ‘move 
on] is the 4 th form [subjunctive] yusdira, ‘to drive away’, meaning, until they [the shepherds] have driven 
their flocks away from the water’) and our father is a very old man’, unable to [come and] water. So he watered [their flock] for them, from another well nearby, by lifting a rock from on top of 
it, which only ten men could have lifted; then he retreated to the shade, of an acacia tree ( samura ), be¬ 
cause of the extreme heat of the sun and he was hungry, and said, ‘My Lord, indeed I am in utter need of 
whatever good, [whatever] food, You send down to me’. The two women returned to their father quicker 
than usual and so he asked them why [it was so]. They told him about the man who had watered [their 
flock] for them. So he said to one of them, ‘Summon him to [come to] me’. God, exalted be He, says: Then one of the two women came to him, walking bashfully — in other 
words, covering her face with the sleeve of her shirt, being shy of him — and said, ‘My father invites 
you, that he may pay you a wage for watering [our flock] for us’. He accepted her invitation, while 
inwardly he disapproved of accepting any wage, for it was as though she sought to remunerate him and 
as though he were of those who would want it [which he was not]. She walked in front of him but when 
the wind began to blow off her dress and reveal her legs, he said to her, ‘Walk behind me and show me 
the way’, which she did. Finally he came to her father, Shu'ayb, peace be upon him, who was sitting with 
some supper in front of him. He said to him, ‘Sit and have some supper’. He [Moses] said, ‘I hope that 
this is not [some sort of] compensation for having watered [their flock] for them? For we are People of a

Sura al-Qasas 


House 3 and do not demand compensation for good deeds’. He [Shu'ayb] said, ‘No. It is [simply] a custom 
of mine and of my forefathers to be heritable to guests and to offer them food’. Thus, he [Moses] ate 
and informed him of his predicament. God, exalted be He, says: So when he came to him and recounted 
to him the Story ( al-qasas is a verbal noun with the sense of al-maqsus, ‘that which is recounted’), of his 
slaying of the Egyptian and their intention to slay him and his fear of Pharaoh, he [ their father] said, ‘Do 
not be afraid. You have escaped from the evildoing people’, as Pharaoh had no authority over Midian. One of the two women, the one that had been sent [by her father], either the elder or the younger, 
said, ‘O my father, hire him, employ him in return for a wage, that he may tend our flock instead of 
us. Surely the beSt [man] you can hire is the Strong, the trustworthy man’, in other words, hire him on 
account of his strength and trustworthiness. He [Shu'ayb] asked her about him and she told him, as 
mentioned above, how he had lifted the rock off the well and that he had said to her, ‘Walk behind me’, 
in addition to his lowering his head when he realised that she was coming towards him, refusing to lift it 
[until she left]. He [Shu'ayb] therefore was keen to have him marry [one of his daughters]. He said, ‘I desire to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine, either the elder or the 
younger one, on condition that you hire yourself to me, that you are employed by me to tend my flock, 
for eight years. And if you complete ten, that is, the tending of ten years, that, completion, shall be of 
your own accord. I do not want to be hard on you, by making it [the marriage] conditional on ten [years 
service]. God willing — [expressed] to seek [God’s] blessing — you shall find me to be one of the right¬ 
eous’, of those who fulfil their covenants. He, Moses, said, ‘That, which you have said, is [settled then] between me and you. Whichever of 
the two terms, the eight or the ten (the md [in ayyamd, ‘whichever of the two’] is extra), in other words, 
the tending thereof, I complete, there shall be no injustice [done] to me, by demanding [of me] to do 
more [tending]. And God is Guardian, Keeper or Witness, over what we, you and 1, say’. The contract 
was agreed in this way. Shu'ayb bid his daughter to give Moses a £taff with which to beat off predatory 
beasts from his sheep — the staffs of the prophets were in his keeping. It was Adam’s £taff, made from the 
myrtle of Paradise, that fell into her hands and so Moses took it, with Shu'ayb’s knowledge.","When he headed towards Midian, he said, “My Lord will surely guide me to a straight way.” . When he arrived at the well of Midian, he found a crowd of people watering [their flocks] and found apart from them two women holding [their flocks] back. He said, “What is the matter with you?” They said, “We cannot water [them] until the shepherds take [their flocks] away, and our father is a very old man.” . So he watered [their flocks] for them, then he turned to the shade and said, “My Lord, I am desperately in need of whatever good You may send down to me[11].” . Then one of the two women came to him, walking modestly. She said, “My father[12] is inviting you so that he may reward you for watering [our flocks] for us.” When he came to him and told him the whole story, he said, “Have no fear. You are now safe from the wrongdoing people.” . One of the two daughters said, “O dear father, hire him; the best one you can hire is the strong and trustworthy.” . He said, “I would like to give you one of these two daughters of mine in marriage, provided that you serve me for eight years; if you complete ten, it will be of your own free will. I do not want to make things difficult for you. You will find me, if Allah wills, from among the righteous.” . Moses said, “Let that be the agreement between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I complete, there will be no further obligation on me, and Allah is Witness over what we say.”","[11] Moses left Egypt having nothing until he arrived in Midian. As soon as he sought Allah's help, Allah gave him a wife, a livelihood, and a home. . [12] Prophet Shu‘ayb, the father of the two women."
28,29,32,"So when Moses had completed the term, of his tending — of eight years, or of ten years, which 
is what is generally assumed — and was travelling with his family, his wife, with the permission of her 
father, in the direeftion of Egypt, he saw in the distance on the side of the Mount [Tur] afire ( al-Tur is 
the name of a mountain). He said to his family, ‘Wait, here; I see afire in the distance. Maybe I will 
bring you from it news, about [how to rejoin] the route [to Egypt] — for he had strayed from it [along 
the way] — or a brand (read with any of the three vowels [jadhwa, jidhwa, or judhwa\, which [either] 
means ‘a bundle’, or ‘a flam e) from the fire, that you may warm yourselves’ ( tastaluna : the ta replaces 
the ta of the [8 th verbal paradigm] iftaala of the verb saliya, or salaya ). And when he reached it, a call came from the right bank, [the right] side, of the valley, to Mo¬ 
ses, at the blessed Spot, [blessed] for Moses, because of his hearing God’s speech therein, from the tree 
(mina’l-shajarati substitutes for min shati’i, ‘from the [right] bank’, and the preposition [min, ‘from’] has 
been repeated because it [the tree] grows there) — the tree was a jujube, a bramble, or a boxthorn — 
[saying] that (an here is explicative, and not in its softened form) ‘O Moses! Indeed I am God, the Lord 
of the Worlds’. And: ‘Throw down your Staff’, and he threw it down. And when he saw it quivering, moving, as 
if it were a serpent (jdnn: is a small snake [so called] because of the s^eed of its movement) he turned 
his back, to flee from it, and did not look back, in other words, he did not return, and so there called out 
[the voice]: ‘O Moses! Come forward, and do not be afraid. Indeed you are safe. 

3 The epithet ahl al-bayt is familiar from the Qur’anic references to the family of the Prophet Muhammad (s); indeed ‘family of 
a prophet’ is an alternative rendition for ahlu baytin as it appears in this gloss, but since it is the prophet himself, Moses, who is 
peaking the translation ‘People of a House’ is preferred (the implication being a House of prophethood). For a recent and informa¬ 
tive discussion on the fecial Status of the families of prophets, see Wilferd Madelung, The succession to Muhammad: a iludy of the 
early caliphate (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), 1-18.

in other words, [against] the fear produced by the glow of the hand, so that you insert it [back] into your

be sent, from your Lord to Pharaoh and his council; for surely they are an immoral people’.","When Moses had completed the term[13] and was traveling with his family, he spotted a fire in the direction of Mount Tūr. He said to his family[14], “Stay here; I have spotted a fire. Perhaps I will bring you from there some news or a brand of fire so that you may warm yourselves.” . But when he came to it, he was called from the tree[15] in the sacred ground on the right side of the valley: “O Moses, I am Allah, the Lord of the worlds. . Throw down your staff.” But when he saw it slithering as if it were a snake, he turned and ran away without looking back. [Allah said], “O Moses, come back, and have no fear; you are perfectly safe. . Put your hand into your garment, it will come out shining white without blemish, and draw your arms tight to you to calm your fear. These are two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs, for they are indeed a rebellious people.”","[13] Moses completed the ten years term instead of eight years.

28,33,35,"He said, ‘My Lord, I have indeed slain a soul among them — the mentioned Egyptian — and so 
I fear that they will slay me, because of him. And my brother Aaron is more eloquent, more intelligible, than me in speech. So send him with 
me as a helper, as an aid (a variant reading [for rid’an, ‘helper’] is ridan ) to confirm me (read [either] in 
apocopated form, yusadiqni, as a response to the request, or [as an indicative] with damma inflection, 
yusadiquni, as an adjectival qualification of rid’an, ‘helper’), for I truly fear that they will deny me’. He said, ‘We will Strengthen your arm. We will make you Strong, by means of your brother, 
and We will give authority, victory, so that they will not be able to touch [either of ] you, with any evil; 
go both of you, with Our signs the two of you, and those who follow you [two], will be the victors’, 
over them.","Moses said, “My Lord, I have killed one of their men, and I fear that they may kill me. . My brother Aaron is more eloquent than me in speech, so send him with me as a helper to confirm my words, for I fear that they may reject me.” . Allah said, “We will strengthen you through your brother and give you both power, so they cannot harm you. With Our signs, you and your followers will prevail.”",
28,36,43,"But when Moses brought them Our clear signs ( bayyinatin, a circumstantial qualifier) they said, 
‘litis is nothing but concodted, invented, sorcery. And we never heard of such [ a thing], to have [ever] 
existed, in, the days of, our forefathers’. And Moses said, (wa-qala, or qala, without the ‘and’) My Lord knows be£t who brings guidance 
from Him (the suffixed pronoun [in ' indihi ] refers to the Lord) and whose ( man here is a supplement to 
the previous man ) will be (read takiina or yakuna) the sequel of the [Blissful] Abode, that is to say, the 
praiseworthy sequel in the Abode of the Hereafter, in other words, it is I [Moses], in both cases, and I Sjieak 
truthfully in what I have brought [you]. Truly the evildoers, the disbelievers, will not be successful’. And Pharaoh said, ‘O [members of the] council, I do not know of any god for you other than 
me. So kindle for me, O Haman, [afire] over the clay, and bake for me bricks [of clay], and make me 
a tower, a lofty palace, that I may take a look at the god of Moses, to observe him and inSJjeCt him;/or 
truly I consider him to be a liar’, in his claim of [the existence of] some other god and that he is his 
messenger. And he and his hofts a died arrogantly in the land, the land of Egypt, without right, and 
thought they would not return to Us (read aCtive yarjiuna, or passive yurja'ima, ‘they would [not] be 
brought back’). So We seized him and his hodls, and flung them into the waters, the sea, and they drowned. So 
behold how was the sequel for the evildoers, when they ended up being destroyed. And We made them, in this world, leaders (read a-imma, pronouncing both hamzas, or by 
changing the second one into a yd'), chieftains of idolatry, who invite to the Fire, by inviting to idolatry, 
and on the Day of Resurredlion they will not be helped, by having the chastisement averted from them. And We made a curse, ignominy, pursue them in this world, and on the Day of Resurredlion 
they will be among the dpurned, those banished [from God’s mercy]. And verily We gave Moses the Scripture, the Torah, after We had destroyed the former genera¬ 
tions, the people of Noah, ‘Ad, Thamud and others, [containing] eye-openers for mankind (basaira, is a 
circumstantial qualifier referring to al-kitab, ‘the Scripture’, the plural of basira, which is the [perceptive]

for those who implement it, and mercy, for those who believe therein, that perhaps they might remem¬ 
ber, [that] they might be admonished by the admonitions it [the Scripture] contains.","When Moses came to them with Our clear signs, they said, “This is nothing but fabricated magic; we have not heard of this from our earlier ancestors.” . Moses said, “My Lord knows best who has come with guidance from Him and who will have the best abode in the end. The wrongdoers will never succeed.” . Pharaoh said, “O chiefs, I do not know for you any god other than myself. So bake for me bricks out of clay, O Hāmān, and build for me a tower so that I may have a look at the God of Moses, for I think he is a liar.” . He and his soldiers were arrogant in the land without any right and thought that they would not be brought back to Us. . So We seized him and his soldiers and flung them into the sea[16]. See how was the end of the wrongdoers! . We made them leaders[17] calling to the Fire, and on the Day of Resurrection they will not be helped. . We caused a curse to pursue them in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be among those who are despised. . We gave Moses the Scripture after destroying earlier nations, as an insight for mankind, and a guidance and mercy, so that they may take heed.","[16] Allah caused them to enter the sea in pursuit of Moses and the believers. .

commandment, to deliver the Message to Pharaoh and his people, nor were you among the witnesses, to 
this, to know it and inform of it; but We brought forth generations, communities, after Moses, and life was prolonged in their 
case, in other words, they lived long lives and so they forgot the covenants [made with God], knowledge 
disappeared and revelation ceased. Then We brought you as Messenger and revealed to you the Story of 
Moses and others. And you were not a dweller, a resident, among the people ofMidian reciting to them 
Our revelations (tatlu ‘alayhim ayatina, a second predicate [after thawiyan, ‘dweller’), to know their

earnestly; but. We have sent you, as a mercy from your Lord, that you may warn a people to whom no 
warner came before you — these are the people of Mecca — and that perhaps they may remember, they 
may be admonished.","You were not [O Prophet] on the western side [of the mountain] when We gave Moses Our commandment, nor did you witness that event[18]. .

You were not at the side of Mount Tūr when We called out [to Moses]. But [you have been sent] as a mercy from your Lord, to warn a people to whom no warner had come before you, so that they may take heed.","[18] The pagans of Makkah are recurrently reminded in the Quran that the Prophet (ﷺ) did not witness any of these events that happened centuries before his birth. See 12:102, 3:44, 11:49. So the only logical way of knowing about these stories is the divine revelation. . [19] So they forgot and neglected the ordinances of Allah over time.

28,47,50,"Otherwise, if an affliction, a punishment, should befall them because of what their own hands 
have sent before them, in the way of disbelief and otherwise, they might say, ‘Our Lord, why did You not 
send a messenger to us, that we might have followed Your signs, the ones sent with the messengers, and 
been of the believers?’ (the response to [the conditional particle] lawla, ‘if’, has been omitted, and what

or, ‘were it not for their saying that is the cause of their afflicftion, We would have hastened on for them 
their punishment and We would not have sent you as a messenger to them’). But when the truth, namely, Muhammad (s), came to them from Us, they said, ‘Why has he not 
been given the like of what Moses was given?’, in the way of signs, such as the glowing hand, the Staff and 
others, or [by having] the Book revealed all at once. God, exalted be He, says: And did they not disbe¬ 
lieve in what was given to Moses before?; [before] when, they said, regarding him and Muhammad (s), 
‘Two sorcerers ( sahiran; a variant reading has sihran, ‘two sorceries’, namely [what they said regarding] 
the Qur’an and the Torah) abetting each other.’ And they said, ‘We indeed disbelieve in both’, the two 
prophets and the two Scriptures [of Moses and Muhammad]. Say, to them: ‘Then bring some Scripture from God that is better in guidance than these two. 
Scriptures, that I may follow it, if you are truthful’, in what you say. Then if they do not respond to you, regarding your invitation [to them] to bring a Scripture, 
know that they are only following their desires, in [persisting in] their disbelief. And who is more aCtray 
than he who follows his desire without any guidance from God?, in other words, there is no one more 
a Stray than such [a person]. Truly God does not guide the evildoing, the disbelieving,/o/fc.","So they would not say – if struck by a calamity because of what their hands have sent forth, “Our Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, so we could follow Your verses and be among the believers?” . But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, “If only he was given the like of what was given to Moses before[21].” Did they not reject what was given to Moses before? They say, “Both [revelations] are works of magic, supporting each other”, adding, “We truly reject both of them[22].” . Say, “Then bring a scripture from Allah which is better in guidance than these two so that I may follow it, if you are truthful.” . But if they do not respond to you, then know that they only follow their desires. Who is more astray than one who follows his desire without any guidance from Allah? Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.","[21] The pagans of Makkah demanded that the Qur’an should have been revealed all at once like the Torah, and the Prophet (ﷺ) should have brought us tangible miracles like Moses’ staff, illuminating hand, etc.

28,51,56,"And now verily We have brought. We have explained [to], them the Word, the Qur’an, that per¬ 
haps they might remember, [they might] be admonished and believe. Those to whom We gave the Scripture before this, that is, [before] the Qur’an, they believe in 
it, too. This was revealed regarding certain Jews who became Muslims, such as ‘Abd Allah b. Salam and 
others, and [certain] Christians who had come from Abyssinia and Syria [who also became Muslims]. And, when it is recited to them, the Qur’an, they say, ‘We believe in it. It is indeed the Truth 
from our Lord. Lo! [even] before it we had submitted’, we affirmed God’s Oneness. Those will be given their reward twice over, for believing in both Scriptures, for the patience

they showed, for having been Steadfast in implementing [the prescriptions in] them; and they ward 
off, from themselves, evil with good, and expend, give as voluntary alms, of that which We have pro¬ 
vided them. And when they hear vanity, vile words and hurtful intent from the disbelievers, they disregard 
it and say, ‘To us [belong] our deeds and to you [belong] your deeds. Peace to you — a parting truce 
(salam mutdraka),* in other words you are secure from any abuse or the like on our part. We do not de¬ 
sire [friendship with] the ignorant’, we do not seek companionship with them. The following was revealed regarding the Prophets longing for his uncle Abu Talib to embrace 
faith: You cannot guide whom you like, to be guided, but [it is] God [Who] guides whomever He will, 
and He knows best those who will be guided.","And We have constantly conveyed the Word [of admonition] to them[23], so that they may take heed. . As for those whom We gave the Scripture before this [Qur’an], they[24] do believe in it. . When this [Qur’an] is recited to them, they say, “We believe in it, for it is the truth from our Lord. We had already submitted [as Muslims even] before this[25].” . They will be given their reward twice for their patience, repelling evil with good[26], and for spending out of what We have provided for them. . When they hear vain talk, they turn away from it and say, “We are accountable for our deeds and you for yours. Peace [is our response] to you[27]! We do not want [to be with] the ignorant.” . You cannot guide whoever you like, but Allah guides whom He wills, and He knows best who will be guided.","[23] i.e., to the pagans of Makkah and the Jews from among the Children of Israel about the consequences of the doomed nations. . [24] i.e., the sincere believers among the People of the Book. . [25] Such as ‘Abdullah ibn Salām and Salmān al-Fārisi. . [26] i.e., compensating their misdeeds with good deeds, or responding to evil with what is good. . [27] i.e., ""You are secure from being treated in a like manner by us."""
28,57,59,"And they, his people, say, ‘If we were to follow the Guidance with you, we will be deprived from 
our land’, torn out of it swiftly. God, exalted be He, says: Have We not established for them a secure Sanc¬ 
tuary, [one] in which they are secure from the raids and killings that occur among the Arab tribes, to 
which are brought (read tujbd or yujbd) fruits of all kinds, [fruits] from every direction, as a provision, 
for them, from Us? But moil of them do not know, that what We say is the truth. And how many a town We have destroyed whose lifestyle was one of arrogant ungratefulness — 
by ‘town is meant the inhabitants thereof. Those are their dwellings, which have not been dwelt in after 
them except a little, by passers-by, for a day or part of it. And it was We Who were the [sole] inheritors, 
after them. And your Lord never destroyed the towns, because of evildoing on their part, until He had 
raised up in their mother-town, that is, the major [town] among them, a messenger to recite Our signs 
to them. And We never destroyed the towns unless their inhabitants were committing evil, by denying 
the messengers.","They say, “If we follow the guidance with you [O Prophet], we will be snatched away from our land[28].” Have We not established for them a safe sanctuary [in Makkah] to which fruits of all kinds are brought as provision from Us? But most of them do not know. . How many a town We have destroyed that were arrogant due to their affluence! Those are their dwellings which were never inhabited after them except briefly[29]. It is We Who were the Inheritors. . Your Lord would never destroy towns without first sending to their main city a messenger, reciting to them Our verses. Nor would We destroy towns unless their people were wrongdoers.",[28] By other Arab tribes. . [29] By travelers of pagans of Makkah seeking temporary shelter.
28,60,67,"And whatever things you have been given are [only] the [short-lived] enjoyment of the life of 
this world and an ornament thereof, in other words, [things] which you enjoy and adorn yourselves 
with for the days of your lives, after which they perish; and what is with God, in other words, His re¬ 
ward, is better and more lasting. Will you not understand? ( ta’qiluna; or read yaqilima, ‘will they [not] 
understand’) that what laSts is better than what perishes. Is he to whom We have given a fair promise, which he will receive, which he will attain, and that 
[promise] is Paradise, like him to whom We have given the enjoyment of the life of this world, [enjoy¬ 
ment] which will disappear soon, then on the Day of Resurrection he will be of those arraigned?, before 
the Fire. The former is the believer, the latter the disbeliever: in other words the two are not equal. And, mention, the day when He, God, will call to them and say, ‘Where [then] are My partners, 
those whom you used to claim?’, were partners of Mine. Those againSt whom the Word [ of punishment] will have become due, the justified [Word], that 
they be admitted into the Fire — and these are the leaders of misguidance — they shall say, ‘Our Lord! 
These are the ones whom we led aStray ( haulai’lladhina aghwayna is both a subject and an adjectival 
qualification). We led them aStray ( aghwayndhum, the predicate thereof) and they went aStray, even as 
we went aStray — we did not compel them to [follow] error. We declare our innocence, of them, before 
You; it was not us that they worshipped’ ( ma, ‘not’, is for negation; the direct object [iyydnd, ‘us’] pre¬ 
cedes [the verb yabuduna, ‘they worshipped’] in order to concord with the end-rhyme of the verses). And it shall be said, ‘Call [now] to your associates!’, namely, the idols you alleged to be partners 
of God. So they will call to them, but they will not answer them, their call, and they, the former, will 
see, they will sight, the chastisement: [they will wish] if only they had been guided!, in this world, they 
would not have seen it in the Hereafter.

Sura al-Qasas And, mention, the day when He will call to them and say, ‘What response did you give to those 
[messengers] who were sent?’, to you. The tidings, the news of deliverance contained in the re^onse, will be obscured to them on that 
day, in other words, they will not find any statement that might contain [hope of] deliverance for them; 
so they will not question one other, about this, and will fall silent. But as for him who repents, of idolatry, and believes, in the affirmation of Gods Oneness, and 
ads righteously, he observes the duties [of religion], maybe he will be among the successful, those deliv¬ 
ered according to Gods promise.","Whatever you have been given is only an enjoyment and adornment of the life of this world, but what is with Allah is better and more lasting. Will you not then understand? . Is one whom We promised a good promise – which he is going to obtain – like one whom We gave the pleasure of the life of this world, then on the Day of Resurrection he will be among those summoned [to Hellfire]? . And [beware of] the Day when He will call out to them and say, “Where are those whom you claimed to be My partners?” . Those against whom the word will be fulfilled[30] will say, “Our Lord, these are the ones whom we led astray; we led them astray as we ourselves went astray. We disassociate ourselves [from them] before You; it was not us that they used to worship[31].” . Then they will be told, “Call upon your [so-called] partners [for help].” They will call upon them, but will receive no response. They will see the punishment, wishing that they had followed guidance. . On the Day when He will call out to them, saying, “What response did you give to the messengers?” . They will be dumbstruck[32] on that Day, not even able to ask one another. . But whoever repents and believes, and does righteous deeds, he will be among the successful.","[30] i.e., the disbelievers upon whom the decree of punishment has been passed.
 [31] i.e., We did not force them, nor did they obey us; rather, they obeyed their own desires. . [32] Not being able to make excuses or invent lies."
28,68,75,"And your Lord creates whatever He will and chooses, whatever He will. They, the idolaters, do 
not have the choice, the right to choose anything. Glory be to God and exalted be He above what they 
associate, [above] their idolatry. And your Lord knows what their breads conceal, [what] their hearts keep secret of disbelief and 
otherwise, and what they proclaim, by their tongues of such things. And He is God; there is no god except Him. To Him belongs [ all] praise in the former, namely, 
the life of this world, and in the latter. Paradise. And to Him belongs the judgement, the decree effective 
in [the case of] all things, and to Him you will be returned, through resurrection. Say, to the people of Mecca: ‘Have you considered, in other words, inform Me: if God were to 
make the night everlading over you until the Day of Resurredion, what god other than God, as you [are 
wont to] claim, could bring you light?, daylight [hours] during which you could earn [a living]. Will you 
not then liden?’, to this in a way so as to understand it and so repent of your idolatry. Say, to them: ‘Have you considered, if God were to make the day everlading over you until 
the Day of Resurredion, what god other than God, as you [are wont to] claim, could bring you night 
wherein you red?, from [any] weariness. Will you not then see?, the error you are upon when you ascribe 
partners [to God], and so repent of it. And of His mercy, exalted be He, He has made for you night and day, that you may red therein, 
in the night, and that you may seek, in the day, of His bounty, to earn [your livelihood], that perhaps 
you might give thanks’, for the grace [of God] during both of these [times]. And, mention, the day when He will call to them and say, ‘Where [now] are My associates those 
whom you used to claim?’ — this is mentioned again in order to expound upon it: And We shall draw, bring forth, from every community a witness, and this will be their prophet, 
who will bear witness against what they say, and We shall say, to them: ‘Produce your evidence’, for 
[the justification of] the idolatry which you asserted. Then they will know that the right, to divineness, 
is God’s — none share it with Him. And that which they used to invent, in this world, of His having an 
associate, exalted be He [high] above such [associations], will fail them.","Your Lord creates and chooses what He wills; they have no choice. Glorified is Allah and Exalted is He far above what they associate with Him. . Your Lord knows all that their hearts conceal and all that they reveal. . He is Allah: none has the right to be worshiped except Him. All praise belongs to Him in this life and the Hereafter. His is the Judgment, and to Him you will all be returned. . Say, “What do you think, if Allah were to make the night perpetual for you until the Day of Resurrection, which god other than Allah could bring you shining light? Do you not then listen?” . Say, “What do you think, if Allah were to make the day perpetual for you until the Day of Resurrection, which god other than Allah could bring you night to rest in? Do you not then see?” . It is out of His mercy that He made for you the night and day, so that you may rest therein and seek of His bounty, and so that you may be grateful. . And [beware of] the Day when He will call out to them and say, “Where are those whom you claimed to be My partners?” . We will bring forth from every nation a witness[33] and say, “Bring your proof.” They will then know that the truth is with Allah, and all [false gods] that they used to invent will be lost from them.","[33] i.e., a prophet."
28,76,80,"Indeed Korah belonged to the people of Moses — [being] his paternal and maternal cousin, 
and he had believed in him [in Moses] — but he became insolent towards them, through [his] disdain, 
haughtiness and great wealth. For We had given him so many treasures that [ the number of] their keys 
would verily have burdened a group ofdrong men, in other words, they would have been too heavy for 
such [men] (the ba of [bi’l-’usbati, ‘a group’] is to render transitive [the intransitive] verb); 5 the number 
of such [men required] is estimated to be 70, 40 or 10; other estimates are also given. Mention, when 
his people, the believers among the Children of Israel, said to him, ‘Do not be exultant, in [your] great 
wealth, an exultation of insolence; truly God does not love the exultant, in such [things]; but seek, in that which God has given you, of wealth, the Abode of the Hereafter, by expending it

in obedience to God, and do not forget your share of this world, that is, [do not forget] to strive in it for 
the sake of the Hereafter; and be good, to people, by [giving] voluntary alms, juft as God has been good 
to you. And do not seek to cause corruption in the earth, by committing acfts of disobedience. Surely 
God does not love the agents of corruption’, meaning that He will punish them. He said, ‘In fad I have been given it, that is, [this] wealth, because of knowledge I possess’, in 
other words, in return for it — he was the most knowledgeable of the Children of Israel in the Torah, 
after Moses and Aaron. God, exalted be He, says: Does he not know that God had already destroyed be¬ 
fore him generations, communities, of men stronger than him in might and greater in the amassing?, of 
wealth; in other words, he does know this. And God destroys them, and the guilty will not be questioned 
about their sins, because of God’s knowledge of these [sins], and so they will be admitted into the Fire 
without a reckoning. So he, Korah, emerged before his people in his finery, with his large retinue [all of them] in pro¬ 
cession dressed in gold and silk garments and mounted on adorned horses and mules. Those who desired 
the life of this world said, ‘O (yd is for drawing attention) woidd that we had the like of what Korah has 
been given, this world. Truly he enjoys great fortune’, abundant [fortune] in it. But those to whom knowledge had been given, [knowledge] of what God had promised in the 
Hereafter, said, to them: ‘Woe to you! (waylakum, is an expression of reprimand) God’s reward, of Para¬ 
dise in the Hereafter, is better for him who believes and ads righteously, than what Korah has been given 
in this world; and none will obtain it, namely, the Paradise that is given as a reward, except those who are 
Steadfast’, in [their adherence to] obedience and [refrain] from disobedience.","Indeed, Korah[34] was one of the people of Moses, but he behaved arrogantly towards them. We had given him such treasures that their keys would weigh down a group of strong men. When his people said to him, “Do not exult, for Allah does not like the exultant. . Rather, seek with what Allah has given you the abode of the Hereafter, without forgetting your share of this world, and do good as Allah has done good to you, and do not seek to spread corruption in the land, for Allah does not like those who spread corruption.” . He said, “I have been given all this because of the knowledge that I have.” Did he not know that Allah destroyed some generations before him who were superior to him in power and greater in accumulating [wealth]? There will be no need for the wicked to be asked about their sins[35]. . He came out before his people in all his glamor. Those who desired the life of this world said, “Oh, would that we had the like of what Korah has been given! He is indeed a man of great fortune.” . But those who were given knowledge said, “Woe to you! Allah’s reward is better for those who believe and do righteous deeds. But none will attain this except those who are steadfast.”","[34] Korah was Moses’ cousin. Instead of helping his people, he behaved arrogantly toward them. . [35] Since Allah already knows their sins; they will only be interrogated as a form of censure and rebuke."
28,81,84,"So We caused the earth to swallow him, Korah, and his dwelling, and he had no hoSt to help 
him besides God, that is, other than Him, to protecft him from destruction, nor was he of those who can 
rescue themselves, from it. And those who had longed to be in his place the day before, that is, only recently, were saying, 
‘Alas! God expands provision for whomever He will of His servants and Straitens [it]. He restricts it for 
whomever He will ( way-ka’anna : way is a noun of action, with the sense of‘How astonished I am’, while 
the kaf functions as a [causative] lam, ‘because’). Had God not been gracious to us, He would have made 
us to be swallowed too’ (read active la-khasafa, or passive la-khusifa). Lo! indeed those who are ungrate¬ 
ful, for God’s grace, such as Korah, never prosper. That is the Abode of the Hereafter, namely, Paradise, which We shall grant to those who do not 
desire to be haughty in the earth, through insolence, nor [to cause] corruption, by committing acts of 
disobedience. And the, praiseworthy, sequel will be for those who fear, God’s punishment, by perform¬ 
ing deeds of obedience. Whoever brings a good deed shall have better than it, as a reward, because of it, and this will 
be the like of it tenfold; while whoever brings an evil deed, those who commit evil deeds shall only be 
requited, the requital, for what they used to do, in other words, [only] the like of it.","Then We caused the earth to swallow him and his house. There was no one to help him against Allah, nor was he able to help himself. . Those who had wished for his position the day before started saying, “Oh, it is surely Allah Who extends provisions to whom He wills or restricts it. If Allah had not favored us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us too. Oh, indeed the disbelievers will never succeed.” . That is the abode of the Hereafter We will assign to those who neither seek superiority nor corruption on earth. The best outcome is for those who fear Allah. . Whoever comes with a good deed will be rewarded with what is better, and whoever comes with an evil deed, the evildoers will only be recompensed for what they used to do.",
28,85,88,"Indeed He Who has prescribed for you the Qur’an, [He Who] has revealed it, will surely restore 
you to a place of return, to Mecca — he had yearned for it. Say: ‘My Lord knows beSt him who brings 
guidance and him who is in manifest error’ — this was revealed in order to refute what the Meccan 
disbelievers had said to him: ‘Indeed, you are error’. In other words [God is saying that] he [the Prophet] 
is the one who has brought guidance, while they are the ones in error. And you never expected that the Scripture, the Qur’an, would be conferred on you; but it was, 
conferred on you, as a mercy from your Lord. So never be a supporter of the disbelievers, in that religion 
of theirs to which they summon you. And never let them bar you (yasuddunnaka is actually yasuddunannaka, but the nun of the in¬

the idolaters, by supporting them (la takunanna: the apocopating particle does not affecft the [ending of 
the] verb here because of its invariability). And do not call on, [do not] worship, another god with God; there is no god except Him. Every¬

Him you will be brought back, by being raised from the grave.

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","Indeed, the One Who has ordained for you the Qur’an will bring you back home[36]. Say, “My Lord knows best who has come with guidance and who is clearly misguided.” . You were not expecting the Book to be revealed to you, but it was a mercy from your Lord. So never be a supporter to the disbelievers[37]. . Do not let them turn you away from Allah’s verses after they have been sent down to you. Rather, call people to your Lord, and never be among those who associate partners with Allah. . Do not invoke with Allah another god; none has the right to be worshiped except Him. Everything will perish except His Face[38]. His is the Judgment and to Him you will all be brought back.","[36] This is referring to the return of the Prophet (ﷺ) to Makkah after emigration to Medina, which did take place eventually as a conquerer. .

29,1,7,"Aliflam mim: God knows heft what He means by these [letters]. Do people suppose that they will be left to say, that is, [that they will be left alone] because of 
their saying, ‘We believe’, and they will not be tried?, tested with that which will reveal the sincerity of 
their belief. This [verse] was revealed regarding a group of individuals who when they became believers 
endured suffering at the hands of the idolaters. And certainly We tried those who were before them. So God shall surely know those who are 
sincere, in their faith — a knowledge of direcft vision — and He shall surely know those who are liars, 
regarding it. Or do those who commit evil deeds, idolatry and acfts of disobedience, suppose that they can elude 
Us?, so that We will not be able to requite them. Evil is that, judgement of theirs, which they judge! Whoever experts to encounter God, [shoidd know that] God’s [appointed] term, for this [en¬

29,14,15,"And verily We sent Noah to his people, when he was forty years of age or older, and he remained 
among them a thousand-less-fifty years, calling them to affirm God’s Oneness, but they denied him; so

The duty of the Messenger is only to deliver the message clearly[5].”",[5] It is either the continuation of the words of Abraham or Allah’s words given as a comfort to the Prophet (ﷺ).

the Resurrection [respectively] , they have despaired of My mercy, that is, [of attaining] My Paradise, and 
for those there shall be a painful chastisement.","Do they not see how Allah originates the creation then resurrects it? That is certainly easy for Allah. . Say, “Travel through the land and see how He originated the creation, and then Allah will repeat it a second time. Indeed, Allah is Most Capable of all things.” .

29,24,27,"God, exalted be He, says with regard to the tale of Abraham, peace be upon him: But the only 
answer of his people was that they said, ‘Slay him, or burn him!’ Then God delivered him from the fire, 
into which they threw him, by making it cool and harmless for him. Surely in that, namely, [in that] de¬ 
liverance of him from it, there are signs — namely, the faCt that it did not have any affeCt on him deSpite 
its greatness, and the faCt that it was extinguished and that within a brief period meadows Sprung up in 
its place — for a people who believe, [a people who] affirm the truth of God’s Oneness and His power, 
for they are the ones to benefit from these [signs]. And he, Abraham, said: ‘You have adopted mere idols besides God, which you worship (ma [of 
innama ] relates to the verbal noun) for the sake of [mutual] affedion between you (mawaddatu bayni- 
kum : this is the predicate of inna [of innama ]; the accusative reading [mawaddata baynikum] would 
denote a direCt objeCt denoting reason, 3 so that the ma would denote ‘entirety’) 4 — in other words, you 
are friends of one another in your worship of them, in the life of this world. Then on the Day of Resurrec¬ 
tion you will disown one another, the leaders will dissociate from those who followed [them]; and you 
will curse one another, those who followed will curse their leaders; and your abode, your destination all 
together, will be the Fire, and you will have no helpers’, to protect you againSt it. And Lot believed in him, he affirmed the sincerity of Abraham, and he was his [paternal] nephew, 
from his brother Haran, and he, Abraham, said, ‘Indeed I am migrating, away from my people, toward 
my Lord, to where my Lord commands. So he shunned his people and emigrated from the rural lands of 
Iraq to Syria. Indeed He is the Mighty, in His kingdom, the Wise’, in what He does. And We gave him, after Ishmael, Isaac, and Jacob, after Isaac; and We ordained among his 
descendants prophethood, thus all prophets after Abraham are descended from him, and the Scripture, 
meaning, the [Holy] Books, the Torah, the GoSpels, the Psalms and the Criterion ( al-furqan ). And We 
gave him his reward in this world, which is fair praise [of him] by members of all the [Abrahamic] re¬ 
ligions. And in the Hereafter he shall truly be among the righteous, for whom there shall be the highest 
degrees [of reward].","His people’s only response was to say, “Kill him or burn him!” But Allah saved him from the fire[6]. Indeed, there are signs in this for people who believe. . He said, “You have taken idols other than Allah as a means of love among yourselves in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection you will disown and curse one another. Your abode will be the Fire, and you will have no helpers.” . Lot believed in him, and Abraham said, “I am emigrating to my Lord. He is indeed the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.” . We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and assigned prophethood and scripture to his offspring, and gave him his reward in this life[7], and in the Hereafter he will surely be among the righteous.","[6] The people of Abraham tried to burn him because he called them to worship Allah alone without associating others with Him; eventually, he smashed their idols.

unto men. So God answered his call. And when Our messengers came to Abraham with the good tidings, of Isaac and Jacob after 
him, they said, ‘We shall assuredly destroy the people of this town, namely, the town of Lot, for truly its 
people are evildoers’, disbelievers. He, Abraham, said, ‘LolLot is in it.’ They, namely, the messengers, said, ‘We know very well who 
is in it. Assuredly We shall deliver him (read la-nunjiyannahu or la-nunajjiyannahu ) and his family, 
except his wife: she is of those who will Slay behind’, [of those] who will remain behind in the chastise¬ 
ment. And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was distressed on their account, he was grieved 
because of them, and he was constrained [unable] to help them, because they had handsome faces, 
dressed as gueSts, and thus he feared for them from his people. So they informed him that they were 
the messengers of his Lord. But they said, ‘Do not be afraid, nor grieve. We shall surely deliver you 
(read munajjuka or munjuka ) and your family, except your wife: she is of those who will remain behind 
(ahlaka, ‘your family’, is in the accusative as a supplement to the [suffixed direct object pronoun] kaf[oi 
munajjuka, ‘We shall surely deliver you’]). We are indeed going to bringdown (read munziluna or munazziluna) upon the people of this town 
a scourge, a chastisement, from the heaven because of, on account of the acfts of, their immorality’. And verily We have left of that a clear sign, a manifest one — namely, the remains of its [the 
towns] ruins —for a people who understand, [a people who] reflect.","And [remember] Lot, when he said to his people, “You surely commit a shameful act that no one in the world has ever done before you. . Do you approach men with lust, engage in highway robbery[8], and practice immoral acts in your gatherings?” But the only response his people gave was to say, “Bring us Allah’s punishment, if you are truthful.” . He said, “My Lord, help me against people who spread corruption.” . When Our angel-messengers came to Abraham with glad tidings[9], they said, “We are going to destroy the people of this town, for its people have been persisting in wickedness.” . He said, “But Lot is there!” They said, “We know well who is there. We will surely save him and his family, except his wife; she is one of those who will remain behind.” . When Our angel-messengers came to Lot, he was distressed by their coming and felt troubled on their account[10], but they said, “Do not fear nor grieve; we will surely save you and your family, except your wife; she is one of those who will remain behind.” . We will surely send down on the people of this town a scourge from heaven because of their evildoing.” . We surely left some of its ruins as a clear sign for people of understanding.","[8] And aggression against travelers. . [9] Of the birth of Isaac and his son, Jacob. . [10] Because they came in the form of handsome men, so Prophet Lot was worried for the dignity of his guests from his wicked people."

ticipate the LaSt Day, fear it, namely, the Day of Resurrection; and do not be degenerate in the earth, 
working corruption’ (mufsidina is a circumstantial qualifier, emphasising its operator [wa-la tathaw, ‘do 
not be degenerate’]; it [the verb] derives from ‘ athiya, meaning afsada, ‘he corrupted’). But they denied him, and so the earthquake, the violent tremor, seized them, and they ended up 
lying lifeless prostrate in their habitations, keeled over their knees, dead.","To the people of Midian we sent their brother Shu‘ayb.

[former] dwellings, in al-Hijr and in Yemen. For Satan adorned for them their deeds, of disbelief and 
disobedience, and thus barred them from the Way, the way of truth, though they had been discerning, 
perceptive people. And, We destroyed, Korah, and Pharaoh, and Haman! And verily Moses brought them, before¬ 
hand, clear signs, manifest proofs, but they ailed arrogantly in the land; and they could not thwart Us, 
they could not elude Our chastisement. So each, of those mentioned, We seized for his sin; and among them were some upon whom We 
unleashed a squall of Stones, as in the case of the people of Lot, and among them were some who were 
seized by the Cry, such as Thamud, and among them were some whom We made the earth swallow, 
such as Korah, and among them were some whom We drowned, like the people of Noah, Pharaoh and 
his people. And God never wronged them, by chastising them for [having committed] no sin, but they 
wronged themselves, by committing sins.","And [We destroyed] ‘Ād and Thamūd, which is clear to you from their ruined dwellings. Satan made their deeds appealing to them and averted them from the right way, although they were people of perception. . And [We also destroyed] Korah, Pharaoh and Hāmān. Moses came to them with clear signs, but they showed arrogance in the land, yet they could not escape [Us]. . Each of them We seized for their sin: against some of them We sent a storm of stones[11]; some were seized by a blast[12]; some We caused the earth to swallow[13]; and some We drowned[14]. It was not Allah Who wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves.","[11] e.g., the people of Prophet Lot; and the people of Prophet Hūd (Aad) who were subjected to a furious windstorm for seven nights and eight days continuously.

prayer prohibits lewd ads and indecency, [defined as such] according to the Law. In other words, that

the Book, the Qur’an, which is recited to them? — as it constitutes a ongoing sign that will never termi¬

Allah extends provision to whom He wills of His slaves or restricts it. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of everything. .

The life of this world is nothing but amusement and play, and the Abode of the Hereafter is indeed the real life, if only they knew. . When they board a ship, they supplicate Allah, devoting their faith sincerely to Him. But as soon as He rescues them to the land, they associate partners with Him, . showing their ingratitude to what We have given them and enjoy themselves, but they will soon come to know. .

Who does greater wrong than one who fabricates lies against Allah or rejects the truth when it comes to him? Is there not a home in Hell for the disbelievers? . As for those who strive in Our cause, We will surely guide them to Our ways[22], for Allah is certainly with those who do good.","[19] How are they turning away from belief in Allah alone and worshiping besides Him other false deities that cannot bring about benefit or cause harm?! .

is to say, the Persian victory at fi rs't and the Byzantine victory later were [the result of] God’s com¬ 
mand, in other words, His will, and on that day, the day when the Byzantines will be victorious, the 
believers shall rejoice in God’s help, to them against the Persians. They [the believers] indeed rejoiced in this, as they 
came to know of it on the day that it took place, on the day of [the battle of] Badr, when Gabriel came 
down with this [news] thereon, in addition to their rejoicing in their vicftory over the idolaters on that 
[same] day. He helps whomever He will; and He is the Mighty, the Vicftor, the Merciful, to believers. The promise of God ( wada’Llahi is the verbal noun substituting for the [full] verbal construction; 
it is actually wa’adahumu’Llahu al-nasr, ‘God promised them victory’). God does not fail His promise, 
of such [help], but mo ft people, namely, the disbelievers of Mecca, are not aware, of His promise to help 
them [to victory]. They know [ merely] an outward afped of the life of this world, that is to say, its various means of 
[securing] livelihood, such as commerce, agriculture, construction and cultivation and so on; but they, 
of the Hereafter, they are oblivious (this repetition of hum, ‘they’, is for emphasis).","Alif Lām Mīm[1]. . The Romans have been defeated[2] . in a nearby land[3], but they will gain victory after their defeat . within a few years. To Allah belongs the whole matter before and after [the victory]. On that day the believers will rejoice . at the victory granted by Allah[4]. He gives victory to whom He wills, and He is the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful. . This is the promise of Allah. Allah never breaks His promise, but most people do not know. . They only know the apparent life of this world, but they are heedless of the Hereafter.","[1] See footnote 2:1. . [2] By the Persians. . [3] Or in the lowest part of the earth. . [4] i.e., Allah’s victory to the People of the Book (the Christians) over the Magians of Persia."
30,8,16,"Have they not contemplated themselves?, so that they might emerge from their oblivion. God did 
not create the heavens and the earth, and what is between them, except with the truth and an appoint¬ 
ed term, for that [creation], at the conclusion of which this [creation] will perish, and after which will be 
the Resurrection. But indeed many people, that is to say, [such as] the Meccan disbelievers, disbelieve in 
the encounter with their Lord, that is, they do not believe in resurrection after death. Have they not travelled in the land and beheld how was the consequence for those before them?, 
of [paSt] communities, which was that they were destroyed for denying their messengers. They were 
more powerfid than them — such were ‘Ad and Thamud — and they effected the land, they tilled it 
and churned it up to sow crops and cultivate [trees], and developed it more than these, the Meccan 
disbelievers, have developed it; and their messengers brought them clear signs, manifest proofs,/or God 
would never wrong them, by destroying them without being guilty, but they used to wrong themselves, 
by denying their messengers. Then the consequence for those who committed evil was evil ( al-sua is the feminine form of 
al-aswa’, ‘the worSt’; [it may be read as] the predicate of kana if one reads ‘aqibatu, in the nominative; or 


Tafsir al-Jalalayn 

it is the subject of kdna if read as ‘dqibata, in the accusative; and so what is meant is Hell [in the former 
reading], or [according to the latter reading] simply their evil actions) 1 because they denied the signs of 
God, the Qur’an, and made a mock of them. God originates creation, in other words, He produces the creation of mankind, then He will 
reproduce it, that is, the creation of them, after their death, then to Him you shall be returned (read 
turja’una; or yurjauna, ‘they shall be returned’). And on the Day when the Hour comes, the sinners will be dumbfounded, the idolaters will be fall 
into silence, as their [line of] argument can no longer be continued. And none from among those partners of theirs, those whom they ascribed as partners of God, 
namely, the idols, to intercede for them, shall be intercessors for them and they shall disavow these 
partners of theirs, in other words, they shall dissociate from them. And on the Day when the Hour comes, that day ( yawma’idhin, is [repeated] for emphasis) they, 
believers and disbelievers, shall be separated. As for those who believed and performed righteous deeds, they shall be made happy in a garden 
[of Paradise]. But as for those who disbelieved and denied Our signs, [namely] the Qur’an, and the encounter of 
the Hereafter, the Resurrection and other matters, those, they shall be arraigned into the chastisement.","Do they not reflect on themselves? Allah did not create the heavens and earth and all that is between them except for a true purpose and for an appointed term, but most people deny the meeting with their Lord. . Have they not traveled through the land to see how was the end of those who came before them? They were more powerful than them, and they tilled the land and built it more than these people have ever built. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs. It was not Allah Who wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves. . Then the end of the evildoers was utterly evil because they rejected the signs of Allah and used to ridicule them. . Allah brings the creation into being, then He will repeat it[5], then to Him you will be returned. . On the Day when the Hour begins, the wicked will be in utmost despair. . They will have no intercessors among their [so-called] partners, rather they will disown those partners. . On the Day when the Hour begins, the people will then be separated: . As for those who believed and did righteous deeds, they will be rejoicing in a garden [of Paradise]. . And as for those who disbelieved, and rejected Our signs and the meeting of the Hereafter, they will be arraigned for punishment.",[5] Common sense testifies that He Who originates creation can reproduce it far more easily.
30,17,27,"So glory be to God — in other words, [so] glorify God, meaning: perform prayer — when you 
enter the [time of the] night, in which there are two prayers, the sunset one ( maghrib ) and the later night 
one Cisha ), and when you rise in the morning, in which there is the morning prayer ( subh ). And to Him belongs [all] praise in the heavens and the earth — a parenthetical statement, 
in other words, the inhabitants in both of these [realms] praise Him — and as the sun declines ( wa- 
‘ ashiyyan is a supplement to hina, ‘when [of the previous verse]) 2 , in which comes the afternoon prayer 
(‘asr), and when you enter noontime, in which comes the midday prayer ( zuhr ). He brings forth the living from the dead, as in the case of the human being [who is produced] 
from a s^erm-drop and a bird from an egg, and He brings forth the dead, a s^erm-drop or an egg, 
from the living, and He revives the earth, with vegetation, after it has died, dried out. And in such [a 
manner], of being brought forth, you shall be brought forth, from the graves (read [either as] the adtive 
takhrujuna, ‘you shall come forth’, or the passive tukhrajuna, ‘you shall be brought forth’). And of His signs, exalted be He, indicating His power, is that He created you, in other words, 
your origin, Adam, of duSt, then lo! you are human beings, of flesh and blood, Spreading, across the 
earth. And of His signs is that He created for you, from yourselves, mates — Eve was created from 
Adam’s rib and the remainder of mankind from the [reproductive] fluids of men and women — that 
you might find peace by their side, and become intimate with them, and He ordained between you, 
all, affedion and mercy. Surely in that, mentioned, there are signs for a people who refled, upon God’s 
handiwork, exalted be He. And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the differences of your tongues, 
that is, your languages, such as Arabic, non-Arabic and so on, and your colours, such as white or black 
or otherwise, even though [all of] you are [originally] the offering of the same man and woman. Surely 

1 The English translation above opts for the former reading, in which case what follows will be the explanation of why ‘the conse¬ 
quence for those who commit evil is evil’. Otherwise, the sentence would read: ‘the consequence for those who commit evil deeds was 
that they used to deny the signs of God ...’ etc. That is the difference in nuance between the two alternatives for vowelling 'aqiba. 

2 The term al-'ashiyy is used for the period that sets in when the sun begins its decline immediately after noontime, and thus repre¬

Sura al-Rum 


in that there are signs, indications of His power, exalted be He, for all peoples ([this may be vocalised 
either as] li’Walamina or li’l-’alimina, so [it means] either rational creatures, or people of knowledge 
[re^edively]). And of His signs is your sleep by night and day, by His will, as a repose for you, and your seek¬ 
ing, during the day, of His bounty, in other words, your going about [freely] in order to seek a living [is] 
by His will. Surely in that there are signs for people who listen, listening in a way so as to [be prompted 
to] refled: and take heed. And of His signs is His showing you lightning to arouse fear, in the traveller, of dorms, and hope, 
in the one not travelling, of [the coming of the] rain; and He sends down waterfront the heaven and 
with it He revives the earth after it has died, that is, [after] it has dried out, so that it produces vegeta¬ 
tion [once again]. Surely in that, mentioned, there are signs for people who understand, [a people who] 
refled. And of His signs is that the heaven and the earth remain Standing by His command, by His will, 
without any supports; then, when He calls you [to come] out of the earth, when Israfil blows the Horn 
for the raising from the graves [to commence], lo! you shall come forth, from it alive. Thus your coming 
forth out of it by a call constitutes one of His [many] signs, exalted be He. And to Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth, as possessions, creatures and serv¬ 
ants. All are obedient to Him. And He it is Who initiates the creation, of mankind, then brings it back, after their dedrudion, 
and that is [even] easier for Him, than the initiation — from the perspective of those addressed for 
whom to repeat something is easier than doing it for the fird time — otherwise, in God’s case, exalted be 
He, both are jud as easy. His is the loftiest description in the heavens and the earth, the mod sublime 
attribute, namely that ‘there is no god except God’. And He is the Mighty, in His kingdom, the Wise, in 
His creation.","So glory be to Allah in the evening and in the morning[6], . and all praise is due to Him in the heavens and earth – and [glorify Him] in the afternoon and at noon[7]. . He brings the living out of the dead and the dead out of the living, and gives life to the earth after its death. This is how you will be brought forth[8]. . Among His signs is that He created you from dust, then you became human beings spreading [on the earth]. . And among His signs is that He created for you spouses from among yourselves that you may find comfort in them, and He placed between you love and mercy. Indeed, there are signs in this for people who reflect. . And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and earth, and the diversity of your tongues and colors. Indeed, there are signs in this for those who have knowledge. . And among His signs is your sleep by night and day, and your seeking of His bounty [by day]. Indeed, there are signs in this for people who listen. . And among His signs is that He shows you lightning, causing fear and hope[9], and He sends down water from the sky, reviving therewith the earth after its death. Indeed, there are signs in this for people who understand. . And among His signs is that the sky and earth are maintained by His command. Then when He calls you out of the earth, you will immediately come forth. . To Him belong all those who are in the heavens and earth; all are devotedly obedient to Him. . It is He Who originates the creation and then repeats it, which is easier for Him. To Him belong the most sublime attributes in the heavens and earth, and He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.","[6] This and the next verse demonstrate the times of the five daily prayers. The ""evening"" refers to Maghrib and ‘Ishā’ prayers, and ""morning"" refers to Fajr prayer. . [7] The ""afternoon"" refers to ‘Asr prayer, and ""noon"" refers to Zhuhr prayer. .

30,28,32,"He has Struck, He has coined, for you, O idolaters, a similitude, that is [adually drawn], from 
yourselves, and it is [as follows]: do you have among those whom your right hands own, that is to say, 
among your servants, any partners, of yourselves, [who may share] in what We have provided for you, 
of property and so on, so that you, and they, are equal therein, fearing them as you fear your own [folk], 
[jud as you fear] those free men like you? (the interrogative is meant as a negation) in other words, ‘your 
servants are not partners of yours in what you own, so how can you make some of God’s servants part¬ 
ners of His. So We detail the signs, [so] We explain them in such detail, for people who understand, [a 
people who] refled. Nay, but those who do evil, through idolatry, follow their own desires without any knowledge. 
So who will guide he whom God has led aStray?, that is to say, he will have none to guide him. And they 
have no helpers, [no] protedors againd God’s chadisement. So set your purpose, O Muhammad ( s),for religion, as a hanif, as one inclining to it — in other 
words, devote your religion, you and whoever follows you, purely to God — a nature given by God, 
upon which He originated mankind, and this [nature] is His religion: in other words, adhere to it. There 
is no changing God’s creation. His religion, that is to say, do not change it by becoming idolaters. That is 
the upright religion, the belief in God’s Oneness, but moSt people, namely, the Meccan disbelievers, do 
not know, [anything of] God’s Oneness — turning, referring, to Him, exalted be He, concerning what He has commanded and what He has 
forbidden ( munibina, ‘turning’ is a circumdantial qualifier referring to the subjed [of the verb] aqim, 
‘set up’, in other words [addressing the third plural person] aqimu, ‘set up’) and fear Him and establish 
prayer and do not be among the idolaters, [of] those (mina’lladhina is a subditution [for al-mushrikina, ‘idolaters’] using the same operator

of the oblique [min]) who have divided up their religion, by being at variance over what they worship, 
and have become [dissenting] factions, seds divided over this [matter], each party, among them, rejoic¬ 
ing, delighting, in what they have (a variant reading [for farraqu] is faraqu, in other words, ‘of those who 
have parted with the religion to which they have been commanded’).","He makes this comparison for you from your own lives: do you have among your slaves any partners who equally share with you whatever wealth we have given you[10], so you are fearing them as you fear one another[11]? This is how We make the verses clear for people who understand. . In fact, the wrongdoers follow their own desires without any knowledge. Who can guide those whom Allah caused to stray? They will have no helpers. . Adhere sincerely to the true religion in all uprightness. This is the natural disposition[12] with which Allah has created mankind. There is no change in Allah’s creation. This is the straight religion, but most people do not know[13]. . Turn to Him [in repentance] and fear Him, and establish prayer, and do not be among those who associate partners with Allah, . those who split up their religion and became sects, each party rejoicing in what it has[14].","[10] Here Allah says that humans would not let their slaves be their partners in their wealth, how can they accept helpless humans as partners with Allah Who owns the whole universe in His dominion?!
 [11] So you fear those slaves to share with you your wealth equally, similar to your fear of your free partners to share with you your wealth. . [12] Fitrah: the natural inborn inclination of man to worship his Lord prior to the corruption of his nature by external influences. Thus, the Islamic monotheistic faith is described as the religion of fitrah - that of the inherent nature of humankind.
 [13] i.e., let people stay committed to their fitrah within the religion of Islam. . [14] Of beliefs, traditions, opinions, etc."
30,33,37,"And when some distress, some hardship, befalls people, that is, [people such as] the Meccan 
disbelievers, they call on their Lord, turning, returning, in penitence to Him, alone. Then, when He lets 
them taile mercy from Him, by way of rain, lo! a party of them ascribe partners to their Lord. Let them be ungrateful for what We have given them (this is [an imperative] meant as a threat). 
‘So take your enjoyment. Soon you will know’, the consequences of your enjoyment (there is a shift away 
from the third person address to the second). Or (am: the hamza here is meant for denial) have We revealed any warrant, any argument or 
scripture, to them which might ipeak, a token speech, of what they associate with Him?, in other words, 
commanding them to associate others with God? No! And when We let people, that is, [people such as] the disbelievers of Mecca and others, taile some 
mercy, some grace, they exult in it, an exultation of arrogance. But if some evil, some hardship, befalls 
them for what their own hands have sent ahead, behold! they despair, of mercy. It is in the nature of a 
believer to give thanks in times of grace and to hope [for mercy] from his Lord in times of hardship. Have they not seen, [have they not] realised, that God extends. He makes abundant. His provi¬ 
sion to whomever He will, as a ted, and Straitens?, and He redrids it for whomever He will, as a trial? 
Surely in that there are signs for people who believe, in them.","When people are afflicted with hardship, they cry out to their Lord, turning to Him penitently. But as soon as He gives them a taste of His mercy, some of them associate partners with their Lord, . showing their ingratitude for what We have given them. Then enjoy yourselves for a while, but you will soon come to know. . Is it that We have sent down to them any authority that speaks in support of their associating partners with Him? . When We give people a taste of mercy, they rejoice in pride. But when they are afflicted with evil because of what their hands have done, they fall into utter despair. . Do they not see that Allah extends provision to whom He wills or restricts it? Indeed, there are signs in this for people who believe.",
30,38,41,"And give the relative what is his due, in the way of dutifulness and kindness, and the needy and 
the wayfarer, the traveller, [give] voluntary alms — the Prophets community mud emulate him in this 
re^edt. That is better for those who desire God’s Countenance, [who desire] His reward, in exchange for 
what they do; those, they are the successful, the winners. And what you give in usury — such as when something is given as a gift or a present for the 
purpose of demanding more in return; it [the practice of usury] (riba) is referred to by the same noun 
denoting that [illicit] ‘extra (ziyada) requeued in the [financial] transaction 3 — that it may increase the 
wealth of the people, giving it, does not increase with God — there is no reward in it for those who give 
it. But what you give as alms (zakat), as voluntary alms (sadaqa), seeking, thereby, God’s Countenance, 
such [of you who do so] — they are the receivers of manifold increase, in their reward for what they 
sought (there is here a shift of address away from the second person). God is the One Who created you, then provided for you, then makes you die, then gives you 
life: is there anyone among your associates, of those whom you have associated with God, who does 
anything of the kind? No! Glory be to Him and exalted be He above what they associate, with Him. Corruption has appeared on land, in the wastelands, because of the rain being withheld and the 
vegetation diminishing, and on sea, in lands near rivers because of their waters diminishing, because 
of what people’s hands have perpetrated, of ads of disobedience, that He may make them taile (li- 
yudhiqahum; or [may be read] li-nudhiqahum, ‘that We may make them tade’) something of what they 
have done, that is, the punishment for it, that perhaps they may repent.","So give your close relatives their due, and the needy, and the wayfarer. That is best for those who seek Allah’s pleasure[15], and it is they who will be successful. . Whatever you lend in usury in order to gain more at the expense of people’s wealth[16], it will not increase [in reward] with Allah. But whatever you give as charity[17], seeking Allah’s pleasure – it is they who will have multiple rewards[18]. . It is Allah Who created you, then gave you provision, then He will cause you to die and then will bring you back to life. Is there any of your [so-called] partners who can do anything of this? Glorified and Exalted is He far above what they associate with Him! . Corruption has appeared on land and sea because of what people’s hands have earned, so that He may cause them to taste the consequence of some of their deeds, so that they may return.","[15] lit., seek Allah’s Face. . [16] i.e., to be repaid with interest; or a gift given with the intention of obtaining a greater benefit or a larger gift. [17] i.e., voluntary or obligatory charity.

30,42,45,"Say, to the Meccan disbelievers: ‘Travel in the land and behold how was the consequence for 
those who were before; moil of them were idolaters’, and so they were dedroyed because of their idola¬ 
try, and their dwellings and habitations lie [desolate] in ruin. 

3 The English does not clarify the significance of this gloss. What the commentator means is that the Arabic term for the proscribed 
pradice of usury riban derives from the essentially neutral verb raba, ‘it grew’ or ‘it increased’; but because it is the increase of the 
original amount lent that it is the contentious issue that increase ( rubuww ) has come to denote the practice of usury (riban) — 
hence the commentator’s paraphrase of yarbu as yazidu.

Indeed He does not like the disbelievers, in other words. He will punish them.","Say, “Travel through the land and see how was the end of those who came before – most of them associated partners with Allah.” . Adhere sincerely to the true religion before there comes a Day that cannot be averted from Allah. On that Day people will be divided[19]. . Whoever disbelieves will bear [the burden of] his disbelief, and whoever does righteous deeds, they are preparing for themselves [a place in Paradise], . so that He may reward those who believe and do righteous deeds out of His grace.

30,46,53,"And of His signs, exalted be He, is that He unleashes the winds as bearers of good tidings, mean¬

His will, and that you may seek, [that you may] request of. His bounty, provision, by way of commerce 
at sea, and that perhaps you might [then] give thanks, for these graces, O people of Mecca, and so affirm 
His Oneness. And verily We sent before you messengers to their people and they brought them clear signs, 
plain proofs of their sincerity concerning their Message to them, but they denied them. Then We took 
vengeance upon those who were guilty. We destroyed those who denied them, and it was ever incum¬ 
bent upon Us to give vidory to the believers, over the disbelievers, by destroying these and delivering 
the believers. God is the One Who unleashes the winds which then raise. Stir up, clouds, and He then spreads 
them across the heaven as He will, in small or large quantities, and He forms them into fragments (read 
kisafan or kisfan: ‘scattered pieces’) then you see the rain issuing out of them, that is, out of the midSt of 
them. Then when He drops it, the rain, upon whomever of His servants He will, lo! they rejoice, they are 
happy because of the rain. Though indeed before it was sent down upon them, before that (min qablihi is [repeated] for 
emphasis) they had been despondent, despairing of its sending down. So behold the ejfeds (a variant reading has [singular] athar, ‘the effecft’) of God’s mercy, that is, 
His grace in giving [them] rain, how He revives the earth after it has died, [after] it has dried out, so that 
it produces vegetation [again]. Surely He is the Reviver of the dead and He has power over all things. But if (wa-la-in, the lam is for oaths) We unleash a [different] wind, that damages vegetation, 
and they see it turn yellow, they would begin ( la-zallu is the response to the [conditional] oath) after 
that, that is, after its turning yellow, to disbelieve, to deny the grace of [having been given] rain. Andsoyou cannot make the dead hear, nor can you make the deaf hear the callwhen (read al-

Indeed, We sent before you messengers to their people, and they came to them with clear signs. Then We took vengeance on those who persisted in wickedness, for it is incumbent upon Us to help the believers[20]. . It is Allah Who sends the winds that stir up clouds, then He spreads them in the sky as He wills, and He splits them into different fragments, and then you see the rain pouring down from their midst. Then as soon as He makes it fall upon whoever He wills of His slaves, they rejoice, . although they had lost all hope before it was sent down to them. . See then the effects of Allah’s mercy, how He revives the earth after its death. Indeed, it is He Who will raise the dead, and He is Most Capable of all things. . But if We send a [harmful] wind and they see [their crops] turning yellow, they become ungrateful thereafter[21]. .

other nun coming after it, and likewise the waw [replaced by the damma in lu], because of two unvocal¬ 
ised consonants coming together and it indicates the plural person), ‘You — in other words, Muhammad 
(s) and his Companions — are nothing but followers of falsehood’. Thus does God seal the hearts of those who do not know, [anything of] God’s Oneness, in the 
same way that He has sealed the hearts of these [aforementioned individuals]. So be patient. Surely God’s promise, to give you victory over them, is true. And do not let them 
cause you to be inconstant, those who are uncertain, of the Resurrection, in other words, do not let 
them cause you to succumb to inconstancy and frivolity by abandoning patience, that is to say, do not 
abandon it.

Meccan, except for verses 27, 28 and 29, which are Medinese; it consists of 34 verses revealed after [surat] 
al-Saffat. 


In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","On the Day when the Hour begins, the wicked will swear that they had not stayed [in this world] more than an hour. This is how they were deluded [from the truth][22]. . As for those who were given knowledge and faith will say, “You did stay, according to Allah’s decree, until the Day of Resurrection. This is the Day of Resurrection, but you did not know[23].” . On that Day, no excuse will benefit the wrongdoers, nor will they be allowed to make amends. . We have presented in this Qur’an every kind of example for mankind. But no matter what sign you bring them, the disbelievers will surely say, “You follow nothing but falsehood.” . This is how Allah seals the hearts of those who have no knowledge[24]. . So be patient, for Allah’s promise is true, and do not let those who have no faith discourage you.","[22] They used to make similar wrong estimates in the world that there was going to be no resurrection and accountability. . [23] i.e., you did not acknowledge the truth about the afterlife. . [24] i.e., those who do not want to know the truth; rather, they refuse it."
31,1,5,"Aliflam mim: God knows beSt what He means by these [letters]. Those, namely, these signs, are the signs of the wise Book, the Qur’an, the one containing wisdom 
(the genitive annexation [dyatu’l-kitabi’l-hakim] has the [partitive] meaning of min, ‘from); it is, a guidance and a mercy (read nominative rahmatun-, the popular accusative reading 
[rahmatan ] would make it a circumstantial qualifier referring to dydt, ‘signs’, the operator of which being 
the implicit demonstrative import of tilka, ‘those’) for the virtuous, who maintain the prayer (alladhina yuqimuna’l-saldta, an explication of al-muhsinina, ‘the virtu¬ 
ous’) and pay the alms and who are certain of the Hereafter (the repetition of hum, ‘they’ [here trans¬ 
lated ‘who’] is for emphasis). Such follow guidance from their Lord and it is they who are the successful, the winners.","Alif Lām Mīm[1]. . These are the verses of the Book of wisdom[2], . a guidance and mercy for those who do good, . those who establish prayer and give zakah, and firmly believe in the Hereafter. . It is they who are upon guidance from their Lord, and it is they who are successful.","[1] See footnote 2:1. . [2] i.e., full of wisdom and whose teachings are based on wisdom."
31,6,9,"And among people there is he who purchases idle talk, in other words, that [part of it] which 
diverts [people] from its [true] significance, that he may lead [people] aStray (read li-yadilla; or li- 
yudilla) from the way of God, the religion of Islam, without knowledge and take it (read [subjunctive] 
wa-yattakhidhaha as a supplement to yudilla, ‘that he may lead aStray’; or [indicative] wa-yattakhidhuha 
as a supplement to yashtari, ‘who buys’) in mockery, as something to be mocked. For such there will be 
a humiliating chastisement, one of abasement. And when Our signs, in other words, [in] the Qur’an, are recited to such [a one] he turns 
away disdainfully as though he never heard them, as though there were a deafness in his ears (both 
comparisons constitute two circumstantial qualifiers referring to the subjedt of [the verb] walla, ‘turns 
away’; or it is that the second [comparison] is an explication of the firSt). So give him tidings of, inform 
him of, a painfid chastisement. The use of [the expression] ‘good tidings’ meant derisively againSt 
such [a person] — this was al-Nadr b. al-Harith. He used to visit al-Hlra for commerce and purchase 
books containing the Stories of the non-Arab peoples and then recount these to the people of Mecca. 
He would say, ‘Muhammad recounts to you the Stories of ‘Ad and Thamud, whereas I relate to you the 
Stories of the Persians and the Byzantines!’ They would thus [go to] enjoy his Stories and neglecft to 
listen to the Qur’an. Surely those who believe and perform righteous deeds, for them there shall be Gardens of Bliss, abiding therein (khalidina fiha, is a circumstantial qualification [of a future Status]), in other 
words, their abiding therein will have been ordained once they enter it — a promise of God in truth, 
that is to say, God promised them this and realised it in truth; and He is the Mighty, Whom nothing can 
overwhelm and so prevent Him from fulfilling His promise and His threat [of chastisement], the Wise, 
the One Who assigns all things to their rightful places.","There are some people who engage in a discourse of amusements[3] in order to lead people away from the way of Allah without knowledge, and to make a mockery of it. For such there will be a humiliating punishment. . When Our verses are recited to him, he turns away in arrogance, as if he did not hear them, as if there were deafness in his ears. So give him tidings of a painful punishment. . But those who believe and do righteous deeds, they will have Gardens of Bliss, . abiding therein forever; this is a true promise from Allah, and He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.","[3] i.e., all that diverts one from the Qur’an and the remembrance of Allah such as misleading stories, gossip, singing, dancing, etc."

Nay (bal, is for transition) but the evildoers are in manifest error, [error] that is evident because of their 
ascribing partners to God: and you are like them.","He created the heavens without pillars that you can see; and He placed firm mountains on the earth so it does not shake with you; and He spread therein all kinds of creatures. We sent down rain from the sky and caused to grow therein all kinds of fine plants. . This is Allah’s creation. So show Me what others besides Him have created. In fact, the wrongdoers are clearly misguided.",
31,12,13,"And verily We gave Luqman wisdom, comprising knowledge, religiousness, and right-minded¬ 
ness in Speech; his many wisdoms are well-known. He used to give legal opinions [in matters of religion] 
before David was summoned [to prophethood], but lived on into the latter’s summoning. He then took 
to acquiring knowledge from him [David] and refrained from giving [any more] legal opinions, explain¬ 
ing this thus: ‘Should I not be content if someone [like the prophet David] has Scared me the trouble?’ 
He was once asked, ‘What is the word kind of person?’ He said, ‘The one who does not care that people 
should see him doing evil’. In other words, [We gave him wisdom] and We said to him: ‘Give thanks to 
God, for the wisdom that He has given you. Whoever gives thanks only for his own sake, because the 
reward for his gratitude shall be his, and whoever is ungrateful, for a grace, then surely God is Inde¬ 
pendent, [without need] of His creation, Praised’, in what He does. And, mention, when Luqman said to his son, when he was admonishing him, ‘O my son (yd 
bunayya is an affectionate diminutive [of yd ibni]) do not ascribe partners to God: idolatry is truly a 
tremendous wrong’, so return to him [in repentance] and submit [to Him],","Indeed, We endowed Luqmān[4] with wisdom, [saying], “Be grateful to Allah.” Whoever is grateful, it is only for his own good; and whoever is ungrateful, then Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy. . When Luqmān said to his son, while advising him, “O my dear son, do not associate partners with Allah. Indeed, associating partners with Allah is the worst wrongdoing.”",[4] It is believed that Luqmān was a righteous and wise man during the time of Prophet David.
31,14,15,"And We have enjoined man concerning his parents. We commanded him to be dutiful towards 
them — his mother bears him, and weakens, in weakness after weakness, that is to say, she is weakened 
by the pregnancy, the pains of labour and the delivery; and his weaning is in two years, and We said to 
him [to man]: ‘Give thanks to Me and to your parents. To Me is the journey’s end, the return. But if they urge you to ascribe to Me as partner that whereof you have no knowledge, that ac¬ 
cords with [any] reality, then do not obey them. And keep them company in this world honourably, in 
other words, with decency: dutifulness and kindness — and follow the way of him who returns to Me [in 
penitence], with [adts of] obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I will inform you of what you 
used to do, and requite you for it (the [entire] sentence containing the ‘enjoinder’ [verse 14] and what 
comes after it constitutes a parenthetical Statement).","We have enjoined upon man kindness to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness upon weakness, and his weaning took place within two years. Be grateful to Me and to your parents. To Me is the final return. . But if they strive to make you associate partners with Me of what you have no knowledge[5], then do not obey them. Yet keep company with them in this world with kindness, and follow the way of those who turn to Me [in repentance]. Then to Me is your return, and I will inform you of what you used to do.","[5] Of other false gods, while there is no partner with Me whatsoever."
31,16,19,"‘O my son! Even if it, namely, the evil trait, should be the weight of a grain of muilard-seed, and 
[even if] it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, in other words, in the moSt concealed place 
therein, God will bring it forth, and He will call [that person] to account for it. Tridy God is Subtle, in 
bringing it forth, Aware, of its location. O my son! Establish prayer and enjoin decency and forbid indecency. And be patient through 
whatever may befall you, as a result of such enjoining and forbidding. Tridy that, which is mentioned,

of people. And be modeft in your bearing, being moderate in it, neither dragging slowly nor rushing, but 
peaceful and dignified, and lower your voice; indeed the moil hideous of voices is the donkey’s voice’, 
beginning [its hideous bray] with an exhalation and ending with an inhalation.","[Luqmān said], “O my dear son, even if a deed were the weight of a mustard seed – whether in a rock or in the heavens or in the earth – Allah will bring it forth. Indeed, Allah is Most Subtle, All-Aware. . “O my dear son, establish prayer, enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, and be patient with whatever befalls you. This is a matter of firm resolve[6]. . Do not turn your face away from people [in contempt][7], and do not walk on earth in arrogance.

wholesome form, even limbs and otherwise, and inwardly?, that is, [by giving you] knowledge and so 
on. Yet among people, that is, [people such as] the Meccan disbelievers, there are those who dispute 
concerning God without any knowledge or guidance, from a messenger, or an illuminating scripture, 
revealed by God, rather [they dilute] by [blindly] imitating [others]. And if it is said to them: ‘Follow what God has revealed’, they say, ‘We will rather follow what 
we found our fathers following’. He, exalted be He, says: What! Would they follow such [things], even 
though Satan were calling them to the chastisement of the Blaze?, that is, to what will bring it about 
necessarily? No! And whoever surrenders his purpose to God, that is, [whoever] takes to obeying Him, and is 
virtuous, a believer in [His] Oneness, has certainly graSped the firmest handle, the stronger end, which 
is not in danger of being severed, and to God belongs the sequel of all matters, their [ultimate] return. And whoever disbelieves, then do not let his disbelief grieve you, O Muhammad (s), do not be 
concerned with his disbelief. To Us shall be their return and We shall inform them of what they did. 
Tridy God knows [beSt] what is in the breaSts, juft as [He knows] other things, and so He will requite 
[them] accordingly. We will give them comfort, in this world, for a little [while], for the [duration of the] days of their 
lives, then We will drive them, in the Hereafter, to a harsh chastisement, namely, the chastisement of the 
Fire from which they will find no escape. And if (wa-la-in, the lam is for oaths) you were to ask them, ‘Who created the heavens and the 
earth?’, they will surely say, ‘God’ ( la-yaqulunna, ‘they will surely say’, the indicative nun has been omit¬ 
ted because of the like [sc. the nun] coming after it, and likewise the wow of the [plural] person, because 
of two unvocalised consonants coming together). Say: ‘Praise be to God’, for the manifestation of the 
definitive argument againSt them by the affirmation of the Oneness [of God]. Nay, but moSt of them do 
not realise, that this [affirmation] is an obligation upon them. To God belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth, as possessions, creatures and servants, 
and so none other than Him deserves to be worshipped in them. Indeed God, He is the Independent, 
[without need] of His creatures, the Praised, in His actions.","Do you not see that Allah has made subservient to you all that is in the heavens and on earth, and has abundantly bestowed upon you His favors, both apparent and hidden? Yet there are some people who dispute concerning Allah without knowledge, guidance, or an enlightening scripture. . When it is said to them, “Follow what Allah has sent down,” they say, “No, we follow what we found our forefathers doing.” Is that so, even if Satan is calling them to the punishment of the Blazing Fire? . Whoever submits himself to Allah[8] and does good, has certainly grasped the firmest handhold. To Allah is the ultimate decision of all matters. . But whoever disbelieves, do not let his disbelief grieve you. To Us is their return, then We will inform them of what they used to do. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of what is in the hearts. . We let them enjoy for a little while, then We will drive them to a harsh punishment. . If you ask them who created the heavens and earth, they will surely say, “Allah.” Say, “All praise is for Allah.” Yet most of them do not understand. . To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and earth. Indeed, Allah is the Self-Sufficient, the Praiseworthy.","[8] i.e., obeys His commandments sincerely in words and deeds."

more [ink] than that [would not be Sjient], for His knowledge, exalted be He, is infinite. Truly God is 
Mighty, nothing being beyond Him, Wise, from Whose knowledge and wisdom nothing escapes. Your creation and your resurrection are only as [that of] a single soul, in terms of creation and 
resurrection, because it is the result of the words kun fa-yakun, ‘“Be!” and it is!’ Truly God is Hearer,

whatever they call on (read yad'una-, or tad’una, ‘you call on’) whatever they worship, besides Him is, 
evanescent, falsehood, and because God is the High [Exalted], above His creation by virtue of [His]

is, [in their] supplication, that He may deliver them, in other words, they do not call on any other [god]

disbelief, while others persist in their disbelief. And none denies Our signs, an example of which is Our 
delivering [them] from [such treacherous] waves, except every perfidious ingrate, [ungrateful] for Gods 
graces, exalted be He.","Do you not see that Allah causes the night to merge into day and the day into the night, and has subjected the sun and the moon, each running its course for an appointed term, and that Allah is All-Aware of what you do? . That is because Allah is the Truth, and what they supplicate other than Him is false, and it is Allah Who is the Most High, the All-Great. . Do you not see that the ships sail through the sea by the grace of Allah, so that He may show you some of His signs? Indeed, there are signs in this for everyone who is steadfast and grateful. . When they are overwhelmed by waves like canopies, they cry out to Allah in sincere devotion to Him alone, but when He delivers them to the land, only some of them take a middle course [in faith][11]. But none rejects Our signs except every ungrateful treacherous.","[11] i.e., for they do not show gratitude to Allah in a due manner."

Then an angel is sent to blow life into the embryo.

ward off His chastisement from you. Will you not then remember?, this and become believers. He directs the command from the heaven to the earth, for the duration of this world, then it 
ascends, then the command and the direction [thereof] returns, to Him in a day whose measure is a 
thousand years by your reckoning, in this world. In surat sa’ala, [An asker] asked [the measure is said to 
be]: 1 ‘fifty thousand years’ [Q. 70:4] 2 — and this [day] is the Day of Resurrection, [reckoned so] because 
of the severity of its terrors for the disbeliever. As for the believer, however, for him it will be easier than 
performing any one of [his] obligatory prayers in this world — as is stated in hadith. That, Creator and Director, is the Knower of the Unseen and the visible, that is, what is hidden

kulla shay’in, ‘everything’]). And He began the creation of man, Adam, from clay, then He made his progeny, his offering, from an extract, a blood clot, of a base, delicate, fluid, 
namely, the SJjerm-drop; then He proportioned him, that is to say, He created Adam, and breathed into him of His spirit, 
in other words, He made him a living sensory being after having been an inanimate thing. And He made 
for you, in other words, for [you] his descendants, hearing, meaning, ears, and sight and hearts. Little 
thanks do you give (ma here is extra, emphasising the ‘littleness’ [of the thanks]).","It is Allah Who created the heavens and earth and all that is between them in six Days, then rose over the Throne[2].

in it. We [too] shall forget you, we shall abandon you in the chastisement. And taSte [now] the everlast¬ 
ing chastisement for what you used to pratlise’, of disbelief and denial.","They say, “What! Is it that when we are disintegrated into the earth, will we then be created anew?” Rather, they deny the meeting with their Lord. . Say, “The angel of death, who is in charge of you, will take your souls, then to your Lord you will be brought back.” . If only you could see the wicked lowering their heads before their Lord, “Our Lord, we have now seen and heard. Send us back; we will do righteous deeds. Now we truly have faith.” . If We had willed, We could have given every soul its guidance, but My Word[5] will be fulfilled: “I will certainly fill up Hell with jinn and men all together.” . So taste [the punishment] because you forgot the meeting of this Day of yours. We have likewise forgotten you. Taste the eternal punishment for what you used to do.”",[5] That the evildoers deserve.

world — in their being killed or taken captive, or [through] years of drought and disease — before the 
greater chastisement, the chastisement of the Hereafter, that perhaps they, namely, those remaining of

33,1,3,"O Prophet! Fear God, remain in fear of Him, and do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites, 
[and so follow them] in what contravenes your Law. Truly God is Knower, of what will happens before 
it happens, Wise, in what He creates. And follow what is revealed to you from your Lord, namely, the Qur’an. Truly God is Aware of 
what you do ( tamaluna ; a variant reading has yamaluna, ‘[what] they do’). And put your trufi in God, regarding this affair of yours; and God suffices as Guardian, to pre¬

in all of the above. 1","O Prophet, fear Allah and do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. . Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord. Indeed, Allah is All-Aware of what you do. . Put your trust in Allah; sufficient is Allah as a Disposer of Affairs.",
33,4,6,"God has not placed two hearts inside any man: [this was revealed] in order to refute those disbe¬ 
lievers who said that they each had two hearts with which they could reason better than Muhammad’s 
single mind; nor has He made your wives whom (read as allai, or alia) you repudiate by zihar (read 
tazzahharuna, or tuzahiruna-, the original ta [of tatazaharuna ] has been assimilated with the za) — a 
man would say to his wife for example, ‘You are for me as [untouchable as] my mother’s back’ 2 — your 
mothers, in other words, [He has not made you wives] like [your] mothers, so that they are illicit [for 
conjugality] in that re^edt, [a practice] which in pre-Islamic times was considered a [valid form of] 
divorce. An atonement with [necessary] conditions is necessary in such a case, as mentioned in surat 
al-Mujadila [Q. 58:2-3]. Nor has He made those whom you claim as [adopted] sons {ad'iya, the plural 
of da‘iyy, which is one claimed as the son of one who is not his [biological] father) your sons, in reality. 
That is a mere utterance of your mouths, namely, [of] the Jews and the hypocrites. When the Prophet 
(s) married Zaynab bt. Jahsh, who had been Zayd b. Haritha’s wife, the adopted son of the Prophet (5), 
they said, ‘Muhammad married his son’s wife!’, and so God proved them liars in this. But God ffieaks the 
truth, in this [matter], and He guides to the way, the way of truth. Instead, attribute them to their [true] fathers. That is more equitable, [that is] more just, in the 
sight of God. If you do not know their [true] fathers, then they are your brethren in religion and [as] 
your associates. And you would not be at fault for any mistake you make, in this rested, except, in, 
what your hearts may premeditate, after the prohibition [has been issued]. And God is Forgiving, of 
whatever you said before the prohibition [was issued]. Merciful, to you in this rested. The Prophet is closer to the believers than their [own] soids, in terms of what he calls them to 
and what their own souls have called them to contravene, and his wives are their mothers, insofar as 
they [the believers] are forbidden to marry them. And those related by blood, kinsmen, are more enti¬ 
tled, to inherit [from], one another in the Book of God than the [other] believers and the Emigrants, 
in other words, than inheriting on account of [their sharing] faith and the Emigration, which had been 
the case at the beginning of Islam but was then abrogated; barring any favour you may do your friends, 
by [making] a bequest, which is permissible. This, namely, the abrogation of inheritance on account of 
[shared] faith and Emigration by the inheritance on account of kinship, is written in the Book — in both 
instances al-kitab, ‘the Book’, denotes the Preserved Tablet ( al-lawh al-mahfuz).","Allah has not made for any man two hearts inside him, nor has he made your wives – whom you declare unlawful – your real mothers[1], nor has he made your adopted sons your real sons[2]. These are only words that you utter, but Allah speaks the truth and He guides to the right way. . Call these [adopted sons] by their fathers’ names; that is more equitable before Allah. But if you do not know their fathers, then they are your brothers in faith and your patronized associates. There is no blame on you if you make a mistake in that regard, but only for what your hearts intend. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. . The Prophet has a greater claim over the believers than their own selves[3], and his wives are their mothers. And blood relatives are more entitled [to inheritance] than other believers and emigrants according to the Book of Allah unless you do good to your close associates [through bequest][4]. This is written in the Record[5].","[1] This type of divorce is called zihār: a common practice in Arabia before the Prophet (ﷺ). If someone declared his wife as unlawful for him as the zahr (back) of his mother is unlawful for him, his wife would be divorced. Islam abolished this divorce. Allah says: “As for those among you who divorce their wives by likening them to their mothers, they are not their mothers; their mothers are none but those who gave birth to them.” See 58:2.
 [2] Adoption of a child or an orphan is not permissible by ascribing the child to other than their real parents. Whereas, it is permissible for one to sponsor a child or host them in their home and care for them as they care for their own children, except for legal matters. . [3] He (ﷺ) is more worthy of their obedience and loyalty.
 [4] A previous ruling that allowed inheritance between Muslims, especially between the Emigrants and the Helpers, was abrogated. Only relatives can inherit from one another now, whereas non-heirs can have a share through a bequest of a deceased, up to one-third of the estate. See 4:7, 11-13, 32-33, 176, 8:75.

Qur’anic discourse — not withstanding, of course, a limited number of Stipulations which apply exclusively to the Prophet regard¬ 
ing the share from the Spoils, marriage, Status of his wives and so on. 

2 A pre-Islamic form of repudiation in which the formula ‘you are for me [as untouchable] as the back of my mother’. Islam does 
not recognise this as a valid form of repudiation and it does not dissolve the marriage. However, it is considered particularly rep¬ 
rehensible as it is verbally injurious to the woman and requires a substantial atonement ( kaffara ), as Stipulated in Q. 58:2ff, where 
this zihar is mentioned in more detail; cf. also Schacht, Introduction, 165.

and Jesus son of Mary, that they worship [only] God and call others to worship Him (the mention of 
the five [names] is an instance of supplementing the Specific to the general). 3 And We took from them a 
solemn pledge, a solid [one], that they fulfil what they have been charged with, and this was [effected] by 
[swearing] an oath to God, after which the pledge was consummated; that He, God, may question the truthful about their truthfidness, in delivering the Message, as a 
way thereby to [justifiably] reproach the disbelievers; and He, exalted be He, has prepared for those who 
disbelieve, in them, a painful chastisement (' adhaban aliman is a supplement to akhadhna, ‘We took’).

to imply ‘in the way of [your] digging of the ditch’; or read ya’maluna, ‘[of what] they do’, to imply ‘the 
idolaters’ forming of a confederation).","And [remember] when We took from the prophets their covenant and from you [O Prophet], and from Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, son of Mary; We took from them a solemn covenant . so that He may question the truthful[6] about their truthfulness, and He has prepared for the disbelievers a painful punishment.","[6] i.e., so that He may ask the ""prophets"" what they conveyed and what response they received. The ""truthful"" may also refer to those who believed in the prophets’ message and imparted it to others."

side of the valley and from its lower side, from the east and from the weSt, and when the eyes turned 
away [ in fear], from everything, to [gaze at] their enemies [approaching] from every side, and the hearts 
lept to the throats ( handjir, the plural of hunjura, which lies at the bottom of the gullet) out of intense 
fear, while you entertained all sorts of, different, thoughts concerning God, [some] of assistance, some 
of despair; it was there that the believers were [sorely] tried, [there] they were teSted, to distinguish the 
sincere individual from the one otherwise, and were shaken with a mighty shock, because of the severity 
of the terror. And, mention, when the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is sickness, namely, weakness 
of conviction, were saying, ‘What God and His Messenger promised us, of assistance [to victory], was 
[nothing] but delusion’, falsehood. And when a party of them, namely, the hypocrites, said, ‘O people of Yathrib!, namely, the 
region of Medina (it [Yathriba] is a diptote because of its being a proper noun and because of the [mor¬ 
phological similarity it bears to a] verbal form) there is not a Hand [possible] (read muqam or maqdm ) 
for you [here], in other words, no place to Stay and no [Strategic] position, so turn back, to your dwell¬ 
ings in Medina — they had set out with the Prophet (s) towards the foot of a mountain outside Medina 
for battle. And a group of them [even] sought the permission of the Prophet, to turn back, saying, ‘Our 
homes are exposed, unprotected and we fear for them’. God, exalted be He, says: although they were not 
exposed. They only sought to flee, from battle. And had they been invaded in it, namely, Medina, from all sides and had they been exhorted, 
in other words, had the invaders exhorted them, to treachery, [a return to] idolatrous ways, they would 
have committed it (read la-dtawhd, or la-atawhd, meaning, ‘they would have offered it’, or ‘they would 
have committed it’ [respectively]) and would have hesitated thereupon but a little. Though they had assuredly pledged to God before that, that they would not turn their backs [to 
flee]; and a pledge given to God mutt be answered for, regarding whether it was fulfilled [or not]. Say: ‘Flight will not avail you should youfleefrom death or [from] being slain, and then, if you 
were to flee, you woidd not be extended comfort, in this world, after you have fled, except a little’, [except 
for] the remainder of your terms [of life]. Say: ‘Who is it that can proted you, grant you sanctuary, from God should He desire [to cause] 
you ill, [whether it be] destruction or defeat, or, [who is it that] can cause you ill, should He, God, desire

prophets from whom the pledge was taken.

And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do. . [Remember] when they came upon you from above you and from below you[9], and your eyes grew wild [in horror], and the hearts reached the throats, and you began to entertain various thoughts about Allah[10]. . There the believers were tested and were severely shaken. . And [remember] when the hypocrites and those with sickness in their hearts said, “Allah and His Messenger did not promise us but delusion!” . And [remember] when a group of them said, “O people of Yathrib[11], you cannot withstand [the enemy attack], so go back.” Another group of them asked the Prophet’s permission to leave, saying, “Our homes are exposed,” even though they were not exposed; they only wanted to flee. . If the enemy were to enter the town upon them[12] from all sides, and they were asked to abandon faith, they would have done it and would not have shown hesitation in it except a little. . They had already made a covenant with Allah earlier that they would not turn and flee, and the covenant of Allah will surely be questioned about. . Say, “Fleeing will never benefit you if you try to flee from death or killing, even then you will only be left to enjoy life except for a little while[13].” . Say, “Who is there that can protect you from Allah if He intends to harm you[14] or show you mercy?” They will not find besides Allah any protector or helper.","[7] This is referring to what is known as the Battle of the Trench or the Confederates which occurred in 5 A.H./627 C.E., where the pagans of Makkah along with some Arab and Jewish tribes (totaling around 10,000 soldiers) besieged Madinah, and the Prophet (ﷺ) positioned around 3000 soldiers to defend Madinah. The Prophet (ﷺ) had anticipated the offense and, upon advice from one of his companions, Salmān from Persia, dug a trench around the city to protect it from the invaders. After several attempts to cross the trench, the Allied forces lost morale and were forced to end the siege due to severe weather conditions. By this Allah saved Muslims from the machination of the non-Muslim allied forces to destroy the newly-born Islamic community in Madinah.

they were in the desert with the Bedouins asking about your news, your encounters with the disbe¬

fear of being reviled.","Allah knows well those among you who discourage others[15] and those [hypocrites] who say to their brothers, “Come and join us[16],” and they hardly take part in the battle[17]. .

His Messenger promised us, in the way of trial and [assistance to] victory, and God and His Messenger 
were truthful’, about the promise. And that only increased them in faith, in belief in God’s promise, and 
submission, to His command. Among the believers are men who are true to the covenant they made with God, in Stead¬ 
fastly remaining alongside the Prophet (s). Some of them have fulfilled their vow, having died or 
been killed [fighting] for God’s cause, and some are Hill awaiting, for this [fate], and they have not 
changed, [their commitment to] the covenant, in the lead, and they Stand in contrast to the situa¬

Some of them have fulfilled their pledge[22], and others are still waiting[23], and they have not changed in the least[24]. .

But if you seek Allah and His Messenger and the Final Abode, then Allah has prepared for those who do good among you a great reward.” . O wives of the Prophet, if anyone from among you were to commit a clear shameful act, the punishment would be doubled for her. That is easy for Allah. .

his siSter Zaynab, whose hand the Prophet had asked for in marriage, but meaning on behalf of Zayd 
b. Haritha. They were loathe to this [proposal] when they found out [that it was on the latter’s behalf], 
for they had thought that the Prophet (s) wanted to marry her himself. But afterwards they consented 
because of the [following part of the] verse: And whoever disobeys God and His Messenger has certainly 
Strayed into manifest error. Thus the Prophet (s) gave her in marriage to Zayd. Then on one occasion 
he [the Prophet] caught sight of her and felt love for her, whereafter [when he realised that] Zayd loSt 
his affecftion for her and so said to the Prophet (s), ‘I want to part with her’. But the Prophet said to him, 
‘Retain your wife for yourself’, as God, exalted be He, says:

Tafsir al-Jalalayn And when ( idh is dependent because of [an implied preceding] udhkur, ‘mention [when]’) you 
said to him to whom God had shown favour, by [guiding him to] Islam, and to whom you [too] had 
shown favour: by manumitting him — this was Zayd b. Haritha, who had been a prisoner of war before 
[the coming of] Islam (in the period of al-jahiliyya ). The Messenger of God (s) purchased him before 
his call to prophethood, and then manumitted him and adopted him as his son — ‘Retain your wife 
for yourself and fear God’, before divorcing her. But you had hidden in your heart what God was to 
disclose, [what] He was to manifest of your love for her and of [the facft] that should Zayd part with her 
you would marry her, and you feared people, would say, ‘He has married his sons wife!’, though God is 
worthier that you should fear Him, in all things, so take her in marriage and do not be concerned with 
what people say Zayd subsequently divorced her and her [obligatory] waiting period was completed. 
God, exalted be He, says: So when Zayd had fulfilled whatever need he had of her, We joined her in 
marriage to you — the Prophet consummated his marriage with her without [the customary] permis¬ 
sion [from her legal guardian] and gratified the Muslims with [a feasd of] bread and meat — so that there 
may not he any restriction for the believers in resped of the wives of their adopted sons, when the latter 
have fulfilled whatever wish they have of them. And God’s commandment, that which He has decreed, 
is bound to be realised. There is no restriction for the Prophet in what God has ordained, [in what] He has made law¬ 
ful, for him: [that is] God’s precedent ( sunnata’Llahi is in the accusative because the operator of the 
oblique has been removed [from the oblique construction ka-sunnati’Llahi, ‘as is God’s precedent’) with 
those who passed away before, of prophets, which is that there is no restriction for them in this reject,

Him, and fear no one except Him, and therefore they do not fear what people [might] say about that 
which God has made lawful for them. And God suffices as Reckoner, as keeper of the deeds of His crea¬ 
tures and [as One] to reckon with them.  Muhammad is not the father of any man among you: he is not Zayd’s biological father and so it 
is not unlawful for him to marry his [former] wife Zaynab [after him]; but, he is, the Messenger of God 
and the Seal of the Prophets, and so he will not have a son that is a [fully grown] man to be a prophet 
after him (a variant reading [for khatim al-nabiyyina] has khatam al-nabiyyin, as in the instrument 
[known as a] ‘seal’, in other words, their [prophethood] has been sealed by him). And God has knowl¬ 
edge of all things, among these is the facft that there will be no prophet after him, and even when the lord 
Jesus descends [at the end of days] he will rule according to his [Muhammad’s] Law.","It is not for a believing man or woman – when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter – to have any other choice in their matter[29]. Whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has clearly gone astray. . And [remember, O Prophet] when you were saying to the one[30] who was favored by Allah[31] and favored by you[32], “Keep your wife and fear Allah.” You were concealing in your heart what Allah was going to reveal[33], and you were fearing people[34], while it was more fitting that you should fear Allah[35]. When Zayd no longer had desire for her, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there would be no restraint for the believers in marrying the ex-wives of their adopted sons when they no longer have desire for them. And Allah’s decree is bound to be fulfilled. . There is no blame on the Prophet concerning what Allah has made lawful for him[36]. Such was the way of Allah with those [prophets] who came before.

you exclusively, not for the [reft of the] believers ( nikah, ‘marriage’, when expressed by the term hiba,

[ 33 : 53 ] 0 you who believe, do notenter the Prophet’s houses unless permission is granted you, to enter 
by invitation, to [share] a meal, and so you enter, without waiting for the [right] moment, [for] when 
it is ready ( indhu, a verbal noun from and, ya’nt). But when you are invited, enter, and, when you have 
had your meal, disperse, without, lingering for, any [leisurely] conversation, amongst yourselves. In¬ 
deed that, lingering, is upsetting for the Prophet, and he is [ too] shy of you, to make you leave, but God 
is not shy of the truth, that you should leave — in other words. He would never refrain from declaring it 
(a variant reading [for yaStahyi] has yaStahi). And when you ask anything of [his] womenfolk, in other 
words, the wives of the Prophet (s), ask them from behind a screen, a curtain. That is purer for your 
hearts and their hearts, than [entertaining] sinful thoughts. And you should never cause the Messenger 
of God hurt, in any way; nor ever marry his wives after him. Assuredly that in God’s sight woidd be 
very grave, as a sin.","O you who believe, when you marry believing women and then divorce them before the marriage is consummated[40], you have no reason to ask them to observe any waiting period[41], so give them compensation and release them in a pleasant manner. . O Prophet, We have made lawful for you[42] your wives whose dowries[43] you have paid; any bondwomen you may own from the captives whom Allah has bestowed upon you; daughters of your paternal uncle, daughters of your paternal aunts, daughters of your maternal uncle, daughters of your maternal aunts who have migrated with you; and a believing woman who offers herself to the Prophet [without dowry] if the Prophet wishes to marry her, [this is] exclusively for you, not for the rest of the believers. We know well what We have ordained for them concerning their marriages and the bondwomen they may own, so that there would be no discomfort for you. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.. . You [O Prophet] may postpone [the turn of] whoever you wish [of your wives], and you may share your time with whoever of them you wish[44], and there is no blame on you if you call back any of those whose turn you have set aside. That is more likely that they will be content and not distressed, and that they will be satisfied with what you give them all. Allah knows what is in your hearts, and Allah is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing. . It is not lawful for you [O Prophet] to marry more women henceforth, nor can you replace any of them with others, even if their beauty may please you, except those bondwomen whom you own. And Allah is ever Watchful over all things.","[40] Lit., before you touch them.
 [41] After divorce a waiting period of three months is observed; however, if the marriage is not consummated, then there is no waiting period after the divorce. . [42] As for the Muslims, see 4:3. [43] i.e., bridal gifts (mahr). . [44] The Prophet’s marital life is classified into four stages: He was single until the age of 25. He was married only to Khadijah from the age of 25 to 50. He had no wife after Khadijah’s death from the age of 50 to 52. Finally, he had a total of ten wives from the age of 53 until his death at the age of 63. Most of these marriages were to widows, and in some cases to foster ties with some of his companions and neighboring tribes. ‘Ā’ishah was the only virgin among all his wives."
33,53,55," Whether you disclose anything or keep it hidden, regarding marrying them after him, truly God 
has knowledge of all things, and will requite you for it. They [the Prophet’s wives] would not be at fault with regard to [socialising with] their fathers, 
or their sons, or their brothers, or their brothers’ sons, or their sifters’ sons, or their own, believing, 
women, or what their right hands own, of slavegirls or [male] servants, in seeing them or conversing 
with them without a screen. And fear [ O women ] God, in what you have been commanded. Surely God 
is Witness to all things, with nothing being hidden from Him.","O you who believe, do not enter the houses of the Prophet unless you are given permission for a meal; not so early as to wait for the meal to be prepared. But if you are invited, then enter, and when you have eaten, then disperse, without lingering for conversation. Such [behavior] causes annoyance to the Prophet; he is too shy to express it to you, but Allah is not shy of [telling] the truth. And if you ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a screen; that is purer for your hearts and their hearts. It is not lawful for you to cause annoyance to Allah’s Messenger, or to ever marry his wives after him, for that is indeed an enormous sin before Allah. . Whether you reveal something or conceal it, Allah is All-Knowing of everything. . There is no blame on the Prophet’s wives [if they are seen unveiled] by their fathers[45], their sons, their brothers, their brothers’ sons, their sisters’ sons[46], their fellow [Muslim] women, and their slaves whom they own. And fear Allah [O Prophet’s wives], for Allah is Witness over all things.","[45] Uncles, paternal or maternal, are similar to fathers.
 [46] It is permissible for a woman to appear before these male relatives without wearing a hijāb (a complete covering)."
33,56,58,"Indeed God and His angels bless the Prophet, Muhammad (s). Oyou who believe, invoke bless¬ 
ings on him and invoke peace upon him in a worthy manner, in other words, say: ‘O God, bless our 
mafter Muhammad and grant him peace’ ( Alldhumma salli ‘ala sayyidina Muhammad wa-sallim). 

[ 33 : 57 ] Indeed those who are injurious to God and His Messenger — and they are the disbelievers, who 
attribute to God what He is exalted above of such things as [His having] a son or a partner and they deny 
His Messenger — God has cursed them in this world and the Hereafter, He has banished them [from 
His mercy], and has prepared for them a humiliating chastisement, and that is the Fire.  And those who cause hurt to believing men and believing women without the latter’s having 
done anything, [those who] accuse them of what they have not done, have verily borne [the guilt of] 
calumny, they have borne lies, and [the burden of] manifest sin.","Indeed, Allah sends His blessings upon the Prophet, and His angels pray for him. O you who believe, invoke Allah’s blessings upon him and send him greetings of peace. . Those who offend Allah[47] and His Messenger[48] are cursed by Allah in this world and in the Hereafter, and He has prepared for them a humiliating punishment. . Those who abuse believing men and women[49] for something they did not commit, will bear the burden of slander and flagrant sin.","[47] By falsely ascribing children to Him or associating partners with Him.
 [48] By offending him or his household in words or actions. . [49] By physically harming them or falsely accusing them."
33,59,59,"O Prophet! Tell your wives and daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks 
closely over themselves (jalabib is the plural of jilbdb, which is a wrap that covers a woman totally) — in 
other words, let them pull part of it [also] over their faces, leaving one eye [visible], when they need to 
leave [the house] for something. That makes it likelier that they will be known, to be free women, and 
not be molested, by being approached. In contract, slavegirls did not use to cover their faces and so the 
disbelievers used to pester them. And God is Forgiving, of any occasion in the pa ft when they may have 
neglecfted to cover themselves, Merciful, to them in His veiling them.","O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters, and the believing women to draw their outer garments[50] over themselves; that is more likely that they will be known [as chaste women] and will not be harassed. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",[50] Jilbāb (pl. jalābīb): a cloak covering the woman's entire body.

those in whose hearts is a sickness, [in their urge] to fornicate, as well as the scaremongers in the city,

have been massacred!’, or [they say to them], ‘They have been defeated!’. Assuredly We will urge you [to

their scaremongery, and you will find that there is no changing God’s precedent, [no changing of it] 
from Him.","If the hypocrites and those who have sickness in their hearts[51], and the rumormongers in Madinah do not desist, We will surely instruct you [O Prophet] to overpower them, then they will not remain in the city with you except for a short while. . They are cursed; wherever they are found they should be seized and killed outright[52]. .

They will say, “Our Lord, we obeyed our chiefs and our elders[53], but they led us astray from the [right] way. . Our Lord, give them a double punishment and curse them with a mighty curse.”","[53] i.e., our leaders and our dignitaries."
33,69,71,"O you who believe, do not behave, towards your Prophet, as did those who harmed Moses — 
when they would say, for example, ‘The only reason he does not wash with us is that he has an inflam¬ 
mation in his teSticles’ — whereat God absolved him of what they alleged: when Moses placed his robe 
on a rock to go to wash, the rock hurtled away with it until it came to a halt amid a group of men from 
the Children of Israel. As Moses chased it and took his robe to cover himself, they saw that he had no 
such inflammation (udra is an inflammation of the teSticle). And he was distinguished in God’s sight. 
An instance of our Prophet (s) being subjected to hurt was when [on one occasion] while dividing up 
the Spoils a man said to him, ‘This is a division that I do not want to please God!’, whereat the Prophet (s) 
became angered and said, ‘May God have mercy upon Moses, for truly he was hurt with worse than this, 
but endured’ — reported by al-Bukharl. O you who believe, fear God and Speak words of integrity, what is proper. He will rectify your deeds for you. He will accept them, and will forgive you your sins. And 
whoever obeys God and His Messenger has verily achieved a great success, he has attained his ultimate 
goal.","O you who believe, do not be like those who maligned Moses[54], but Allah cleared him of what they said; he was highly honored before Allah. . O you who believe, fear Allah and say what is right, . He will guide you to righteous deeds and forgive your sins. Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger will surely achieve a supreme triumph.","[54] By falsely accusing him of having a skin disease or another physical defect, simply because he used to bathe with his clothes on, unlike others."
33,72,73,"Indeed We offered the TruSt — [the obligation to] prayer and other matters which, when per¬ 
formed, result in reward and when neglecfted, result in punishment — to the heavens and the earth and 
the mountains, and created in them the power of comprehension and Speech [at the time of that offer], 
but they refused to bear it and were apprehensive of it; but man, Adam, undertook it, when it was of¬ 
fered to him. Truly he is a wrongdoer, to his own soul because of what he undertook, ignorant, of [the 
responsibility that comes with] it — 

[ 33 : 73 ] so that God may chaStise (li-yu adhdhiba, the lam therein is semantically connected to ‘aradna, 
‘We offered’, which resulted in ‘Adam’s undertaking’) the hypocrites, men and women, and the idolaters, 
men and women, those who forsake the TruSt, and that God may relent to the believing men and believ¬ 
ing women, who fulfil the TruSt. And God is Forgiving, to believers, Merciful, to them.

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful: ","Indeed, We offered the Trust[55] to the heavens, the earth, and the mountains, yet they refused[56] to bear it and were afraid of it. But man assumed it; he is indeed wrongful and ignorant[57]. . [As a result of that] Allah will punish the hypocrite men and women, and the polytheist men and women, and Allah will accept the repentance of the believing men and women, for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful[58].","[55] i.e., legal assignments and pledge of obedience to Allah.
 [56] i.e., they did not accept the offer for fear of not being able to bear it in a due manner.

34,1,2,"Praise be to God — God, exalted be He, praises Himself with these [words]; the import constitutes 
the eulogy that ‘praise’ is ever-established [for God] and it entails the attribution to Him of all that is 
beautiful, exalted be He — to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, 
as possessions and creation. And to Him belongs [all] praise in the Hereafter, as in this world, for His 
friends praise Him as they enter Paradise. And He is the Wise, in what He does, the Aware, of His crea¬ 
tures. He knows what penetrates the earth, of water and so forth, and what issues out of it, of vegetation 
and so on, and what comes down from the heaven, of provision and so on, and what ascends into it, of 
deeds and so on, and He is the Merciful, to His friends, the Forgiving, to them.","All praise be to Allah, to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth, and to Him is the praise in the Hereafter; He is the All-Wise, All-Aware. .

will be forgiveness and a fair provision, in Paradise. And those who Strive againSt, [who strive] to invalidate, Our signs, namely, the Qur’an,

or [if read mu’djizina ] ‘vying with Us, in order to elude Us’) for they suppose that there is no [such 
thing as] resurrection or punishment — for such there will be a chastisement of an awful punish¬

be in the chastisement, thereat, and in error that is far, from the truth, in this world. Have they not observed what is before them and what is behind them, in other words, what is

reading has the third person singular for all three verbs [sc. yasha, ‘He will’, yakhsif ‘He makes to swal¬ 
low’, yusqit, ‘He lets fall’]). Surely in that, which is observed, there is a sign for every penitent servant, 
turning back to his Lord, [signs] indicating God’s power to resurredt and to do what He will.","Those who are blessed with knowledge can see that whatever has been sent down to you from your Lord is the truth and that it guides to the path of the All-Mighty, the Praiseworthy. . The disbelievers [mockingly] say, “Shall we show you a man[4] who will tell you that when you are completely disintegrated into dust, you will be created anew?” . Has he fabricated a lie against Allah, or is he mad?”[5] No, but those who do not believe in the Hereafter will be in the punishment, and they are extremely misguided. . Do they not see all that is before them and all that is behind them of the heavens and earth? If We willed, We could cause the earth to swallow them up, or cause fragments of the sky to fall upon them. Indeed, there is a sign in this for every slave who turns to Allah in repentance.","[4] i.e., the Prophet (ﷺ). . [5] People knew that the Prophet (ﷺ) was the most truthful person, as he was known to be the wisest person among them too; so Allah did not refute these two baseless accusations; rather, He only made mention of their consequence of denying the life after death."
34,10,13,"And verily We bestowed on David a [great] favour from Us — prophethood and scripture — 
and We said: ‘O mountains, repeat with him [in praise], by making glorifications, and the birds [too]!’ 
(read wa’l-tayra in the accusative as a supplement to the [syntactical] locus of jibdl, ‘mountains’, in other 
words, and We also called on them to glorify [God] with him). And We made iron malleable for him, so 
that it was as dough in his hands. And We said: ‘Fashion, from it, long coats of mail — complete suits of armour which the person 
wearing it drags behind him along the ground — and measure [well] the links’, that is, in the weaving 
of the coats (the maker of these is called sarrad). In other words, make them so that the rings thereof are 
arranged properly. And at I, O family of David, together with him, righteously. Indeed I am Seer of what 
you do, and will requite you for it accordingly. And, We dHjtosed, for Solomon the wind (the nominative reading of al-rihu would be based 
on an implicit [missing verb] sakhkharna, ‘We di^osed’) its morning course, meaning its journey from 
the morning to the noon, was a month’s journey and its evening course, that is, its journey from the 
noon to sunset, was a month’s journey. And We caused a fount of [molten] copper to flow for him, in 
other words, We caused the copper to melt for him, and so the fount flowed for three days and nights 
like water, and to this day people have been using of that [copper] which was given to Solomon [at that 
time]. And of the jinn [there] were those who worked before him by the leave, by the command, of his 
Lord. And such of them as deviated from Our command, to him to obey him [Solomon], We would 
make them taSle the chastisement of the Blaze, the Fire in the Hereafter — but it is also said, [that their 
chastisement was] in this world, in which case an angel would smite one of them with a lash thereof that 
would scorch him. They fashioned for him whatever he wished: lofty shrines (maharib are high edifices which are 
ascended by Stairs) and Statues ( tamathil is the plural of timthdl, which is any thing which you fashion 
as a likeness [of another]), in other words, brass, crystal or marble figures — the use of figures was not 
prohibited according to his Law; and basins (jifdn is the plural of jafna) like cisterns (jawabin is the plu¬ 
ral oijdbiya, which is a large basin) — around each ‘basin’ a thousand men would gather to eat — and 
caiddrons built into the ground, fixed with foundations, and cannot be moved from their places: these 
were made from the [rocks of the] mountains of Yemen, and to which one ascended by climbing up a 
ladder. And We said: ‘Work, O, House of David, in obedience to God, in thankfulness, to Him for what 
He has given you. And few indeed of My servants are thankful’, labouring in obedience to Me in thanks 
for My favours.","Indeed, We bestowed favors upon David: “O mountains, echo Allah’s praise with him, and the birds too!” And We made iron malleable for him: . “Make coats of mail, and maintain balance in the linking rings, and do [all of you] righteous deeds, for I am All-Seeing of what you do.” . And to Solomon [We subdued] the wind: its morning course was a month’s journey and its evening course was a month’s journey. And We caused a stream of molten brass to flow for him, and there were some jinn who worked for him by his Lord’s permission; whoever among them deviated from Our command, We made him taste the punishment of the Blazing Fire. . They made for him whatever he wished of sanctuaries[6], images[7], basins as large as reservoirs, and huge fixed cooking pots. “Do [good deeds] in gratitude, O household of David!” But few of My slaves are grateful.”","[6] i.e., palaces, dwellings, or places of prayer.
 [7] Which were not prohibited at the time of Solomon (ﷺ)."
34,14,14,"And when We decreed for him, for Solomon, death, in other words, [when] he died — he re¬ 
mained supported against his £taff an entire year, while the jinn continued to toil in hard labour as was 
customary, unaware of his death, until [finally] when a termite ate through his £taff, he fell to the ground 
[and was seen to be] dead — nothing indicated to them that he had died except a termite ( al-ard is 
the verbal noun from uridat al-khashaba , 2 passive verbal form, in other words, ‘it [the piece of wood]

replacing the hamza with an alif meaning a Ytaff’, so called because [when describing it one would say] 
yunsa’u bihd, to mean it is used to repel or drive away [creatures]’). And when he fell down, dead, the 
jinn realised, it became apparent to them, that (an, is softened, in other words, annahum ) had they 
known the Unseen — comprising what was hidden from them in the way of Solomon being dead — they 
would not have continued in the humiliating chastisement, [in] that hard labour of theirs, [in which 
they continued] as they supposed him to be alive, which is in contract to what they would have supposed 
had they known the Unseen and the fadt that he had been there an entire year, judging by how much of 
the £taff the termite had eaten through after his death; in other words, [they would not have continued

in the humiliating chastisement] for a single day or even a single night [longer].","Then when We decreed Solomon’s death, nothing showed them that he was dead except a creature of the earth[8] eating away his staff[9]. When he fell down, the jinn realized that if they had truly known the unseen, they would not have remained in the debasing servitude[10].","[8] i.e., a termite was gnawing his staff.

34,15,19,"Verily there was for Sheba (Saba’, declined [as li-Saba’in ] or left as indeclinable [li-Saba’a], is 
[the name of] a tribe that took its name from one of their Arab ancestors) in their dwelling-place, in 
Yemen, a sign: indicating Gods power, exalted be He, two gardens (jannatdn, a substitution [for dyatun, 
‘a sign’]) to the right and to the left, in other words, on the right side of their valley and on its left side. 
And it was said to them: ‘Eat of your Lord’s provision and give thanks to Him, for the graces He has 
beStowed on you in the land of Sheba. A good land — in which there was no dung, gnats, flies, fleas, 
scorpions, or snakes, and in which when a Stranger passed through with his clothes lice-infeded, these 
[lice] would be killed off because of the purity of its air — and, God is, a forgiving Lord.’ But they were disregarded, of giving thanks to Him and became disbelievers, so We unleashed 
upon them the flood of the Dam ( al-’arim is the plural of ‘arima, which is a Structure or something 
similar that holds water back [to be Stored] for when it is needed), in other words, [We unleashed upon 
them] the flood-waters of their valley which had been held back by the mentioned [Structure] so that 
they engulfed their two gardens together with all their property. And We gave them in place of their two 
gardens two gardens bearing (dhawatay, a dual form of [feminine plural] dhawat; usually [the form 
dhatay from] the singular [would have been used]) bitter fruit, bitter and vile (ukul may be read as a

be read without [as ukuli khamtin]; and this [phrase] is supplemented [by the following, wa-athlin wa-

is anyone but the ingrate ever [so] requited? (read hal yujaza illd’l-kafuru; or read as hal nujazi illd’l- 
kafura, ‘Would We requite anyone but the ingrate?’), 3 in other words, it is only the like of such who is 
called to account. And We set between them, between Sheba, who were in Yemen, and the towns which We had 
blessed, with [abundance of] water and trees — these being the towns of Syria, to which they used to 
travel for commerce — prominent towns , 4 continuous [along the route] from Yemen to Syria, and We 
facilitated [for travellers] the journeying through them, such that they would reft for the afternoon in 
one and s^end the night in the next, [and so on] until the end of their travel, having no need of any sup¬ 
plies or water along the way; and We said, ‘Travel through them night and day safely’, having no fear by 
night or by day. But they said, ‘Our Lord, make far apart (ba“id : a variant reading has baid) the stages of our 
travel’, to Syria: make these [ftages through] deserts, so that they could glory before the poor in rid¬ 
ing their camels and bearing their supplies and water, and so they behaved wantonly with the graces 
[beftowed on them by God], and they wronged their soids, through disbelief, and so We made them 
bywords, [of wrongdoing] in this re^ecft, for those who came after them, and We caused them to dis¬ 
integrate totally. We scattered them all over the lands. Surely in that, which is mentioned, there are 
signs, lessons, for every [servant who is] ileadfail, [in refraining] from ads of disobedience, grateful, 
for [God’s] graces.","There was a sign for [the people of] Sheba in their dwelling place: two gardens – one on the right and one on the left. “Eat of your Lord’s provision, and be grateful to Him; a pleasant land and a Forgiving Lord.” . But they turned away, so We sent against them a devastating flood[11] and replaced their two gardens with two others of bitter fruit, and tamarisk bushes, and a few lote trees. . This is how We punished them for their ingratitude; would We punish anyone except those who are utterly ungrateful? . We placed [a chain of] towns between them and the towns We had blessed[12], and We made between them well-measured distances[13]: “Travel through them by night and day safely.” . But they said, “Our Lord, make [the distance between] our journeys longer[14],” and they wronged themselves. So We made them tales [of the past], and dispersed them in all directions.

of all things. Say, O Muhammad (s), to the disbelievers of Mecca: ‘Call on those whom you have asserted, 
those whom you have asserted to be gods, besides God, in other words, other than Him, so that they 
might benefit you, as you are wont to assert. God, exalted be He, says of them: They do not possess [even ] 
so much as the weight of an atom, of good or evil, in the heavens or in the earth, and they do not have 
any share in either of them, nor has He, exalted be He, among them, the gods, any auxiliary’, [anyone 
required as His] helper. And intercession will not avail with Him, exalted be He — this was in response to their saying 
that their gods would intercede [for them] with Him — except for him to whom leave is given, in this 
rested: (read adhina, ‘ [to whom] He gives leave; or udhina, ‘ [to whom] leave is given). Yet, when fear is 
banished from their hearts (read aCti vefazza'a, or passive fuzzi'a), [when fear] is removed from them, 
upon leave being given for this [intercession], they will say — some will say to others in anticipation of 
a favourable outcome — ‘What has your Lord said?’, concerning this. They will say: [He has said] the 
saying that is, ‘The truth’, in other words, leave has been given for it. And He is the Exalted, above His 
creation, by [His] subjugation [of them], the Great, the Tremendous.","Satan found his assumption[15] about them[16] to be true, for they followed him, except for a group of the believers, . even though he had no authority over them, except that We might distinguish those who believe in the Hereafter from those who are in doubt about it. Your Lord is Watchful over all things.” . Say, “Call upon those whom you claim [to be gods] besides Allah. They do not have even an atom’s weight of authority in the heavens or on earth, nor do they have any share in either of them, nor is any of them a helper to Allah.” . No intercession will be of any benefit before Him, except for those whom He gave permission. Until when their hearts are relieved of dread[17], they will say [to the angels], “What did your Lord just say?” They will say, “The Truth, and He is the Most High, Most Great.”","[15] That he would be able to mislead them.

guity here [concerning which of the two is rightly guided] is intended as a gentle invitation for them to 
[embrace] faith if their way to it is facilitated [by God]. Say: ‘You will not be questioned about the sins we committed, nor shall we be questioned about 
what you do’, for we are quit of you. Say: ‘Our Lord will bring us together, on the Day of Resurrection, then He will judge between us 
with truth, and He will admit the truthful into Paradise and the liars into the Fire. And He is the Judge, 
the Knowing’, in what He judges. Say: ‘Show me, apprise me of, those whom you have joined to Him as associates, in worship. No

God, the Mighty, Whose way will prevail, the Wise’, in the way in which He manages [the affairs of] His 
creation and so He could not have any associate in His kingdom.","Say, “Who provides for you from the heavens and earth?” Say, “Allah! And surely either we or you[18] are rightly guided or clearly misguided.” . Say, “You will not be questioned about our misdeeds, nor will we be questioned about your deeds.” .

Those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant, “Had it not been for you, we would have been believers.” . Those who were arrogant will say to those who were oppressed, “Was it we who prevented you from guidance after it came to you? Rather, you yourselves were wicked.” . Those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant, “Rather, [it was your] conspiracy of night and day when you were ordering us to disbelieve in Allah and to set up rivals to Him.” They will hide their remorse when they see the punishment, and We will put shackles around the necks of those who disbelieved. Will they be recompensed except for what they used to do?",

[life’s] comforts, saying, ‘Indeed we disbelieve in that [Message] with which you have been sent’. And they say, ‘Wepossess more wealth and children, than those who are believers, and we shall 
not be chastised’. Say: ‘Truly my Lord extends provision. He makes it abundant, for whomever He will, as a teSt,

[he does so] from the provision given [to him] by God.","We never sent a warner to a town except that its affluent ones said, “We disbelieve in what you have been sent with.” .

It is not your wealth or your children that bring you closer to Us; but those who believe and do righteous deeds, it is they who will have a multiple reward for what they did, and they will be safe in the lofty mansions. . But those who strive against Our verses[21], seeking to discredit them, it is they who will be summoned to the punishment. . Say, “My Lord extends provision to whom He wills of His slaves or restricts it.

Qur’an, when it comes to them, ‘This is nothing but plain sorcery’. God, exalted be He, says: And We did not give them any scriptures for them to Study, nor did We send them any Warner 
before you, so on what grounds do they deny you? And those who were before them [also] denied, and they, these ones [the Meccans], have not 
received [even] a tenth of what We gave those [others], in the way of might, long life and abundance of 
wealth. Yet they denied My messengers, [who were sent] to them, so how was My abhorrence! [so how was] 
My rebuttal against them through punishment and deftrucftion, in other words, it was appropriate.","On the Day when He gathers them all together, then He will say to the angels, “Was it you that they used to worship?” . They will say, “Glory be to You! You are our Protector, not they. Rather they used to worship the jinn[22]; most of them believed in them.” . So Today none of you has the power to benefit or harm one another. And We will say to the wrongdoers, “Taste the punishment of the Fire which you used to deny!” . When Our clear verses are recited to them, they say, “This is nothing but a man who wishes to turn you away from what your forefathers used to worship.” And they say, “This is nothing but a fabricated lie.” And the disbelievers say about the Truth when it comes to them, “This is nothing but clear magic,” . even though We did not give them any scriptures to study, nor did We send them any warner before you. . Those who came before them also rejected [the truth], while these [Makkans] have not been given even one-tenth of what We had given those [earlier nations], yet they rejected My messengers; how severe was My response!","[22] i.e., the devils."

ment’, in the Hereafter, if you disobey him. Say, to them: 7 have not asked you, in return for [my] warning and delivering the Message [to 
you], any reward, since it is for [the benefit of] you, in other words, I do not ask you for any reward 
in return for this. Indeed my reward lies only with God, and He is Witness over all things’, observing 
[them all], knowing my truthfulness.","Say [O Prophet], “I only advise you to do one thing: stand up for Allah, in pairs and individually, then reflect. There is no madness in your companion[23]; he is but a warner to you ahead of a severe punishment.” . Say, “If I had ever asked you for a reward, it is yours. My reward is only with Allah, and He is Witness over all things.”","[23] i.e., Muhammad (ﷺ)."

Unseen’, [of] all that is hidden from His creatures throughout the heavens and the earth. Say: ‘The truth, Islam, has come. And falsehood, disbelief, neither originates nor reftores [any¬

sin of my going aftray shall be held againft me; and if I am rightly guided, it will have been by what my 
Lord reveals to me, of the Qur’an and wisdom. Truly He is Hearer, of supplications, Nigh’. If you could but see, O Muhammad (s), when they are ftricken with terror, at the Resurrection, 
you would see a dreadful thing, and so there is no escape, for them, from Us, that is to say, they will not 
[be able to] elude Us, and they are seized from a close quarter, namely, [from] the graves. And they will say, ‘We believe in him [now]’, in other words, [in] Muhammad (s) — or [if read 
‘We believe in if, then] in the Qur’an. But how can they attain [it] (read tanawush or tanaush), that is, 
attain faith, from a place that is far away, from the place for [attaining] it — as they are [now] in the 
Hereafter, and the [proper] place for [attaining] it was in this world — when they disbelieved in it before?, in this world. And they throw guesses at the Unseen from a 
far-off place, in other words, [they make guesses] about something the knowledge of which was hidden 
far away from them, as when they would say that the Prophet was a sorcerer, or a poet, or a soothsayer, 
or that the Qur’an was sorcery, poetry or soothsaying. And a barrier is set between them and what they crave, in the way of faith — in other words, 
[their craving] to embrace it — juft as was done with their counterparts, in [re^ecft to] disbelief, for¬ 
merly, in other words, before them. Indeed they used to be in grave doubt, [doubt] causing them to have 
misgivings about that in which they now believe, but the proofs for which they never considered in this 
world.

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","Say, “My Lord hurls the Truth [against falsehood], and He is the All-Knower of the unseen.” . Say, “The Truth has come, and falsehood can neither initiate nor restore anything[24].” . Say, “If I go astray, the detriment of my straying is only upon myself; but if I am guided, it is because of what my Lord reveals to me. He is indeed All-Hearing, Ever Near.” . If only you could see when they are stricken with terror, but there will be no escape, and they will be seized from a nearby place[25]. . They will say, “Now we believe in it,” but how could they attain faith from such a distant place[26], . while they disbelieved in it before, making far-fetched conjectures about the unseen[27]? . A barrier will be placed between them and what they desire[28], as was done with the likes of them before, for they were indeed in a disquieting doubt.","[24] i.e., the falsehood has been abolished. . [25] i.e., from the place of Judgment to the Hellfire. . [26] For it is already too late to return to worldly life. . [27] i.e., conjectures far from the truth; saying about the Prophet (ﷺ) that he is a magician, a soothsayer, a poet, etc. . [28] i.e., the attainment of faith and admission into Paradise."
35,1,4,"Praise be to God, God praises Himself with in these [terms], as explained at the beginning of [the 
preceding] surat Saba’, Originator of the heavens and the earth, the One Who created them without 
any precedent, Appointer of the angels as messengers, to [His] prophets, having wings in [sets of] two 
or three or four. He multiplies in creation, in angels and other [creatures], what He will. Surely God has 
power over all things. Whatever mercy God unfolds for mankind, in the way of provision or rain, none can withhold it; 
and whatever He withholds, thereof, none can release it after Him, that is, after His withholding it. And 
He is the Mighty, Whose way prevails, the Wise, in what He does. 

[ 35 : 3 ] O people, that is, the people of Mecca, remember God’s grace to you, in His making you dwell 
within the [Meccan] SanCtuary and preventing raids againSt you. Is there any creator (min khaliqin: min 
is extra; khaliq is the subjecft) other than God (read ghayru’Llahi or gharyri’Llahi, as an adjectival qualifi¬ 
cation of khaliq, creator’, either concording with the [oblique] form [of min khaliqin] or concording with 
the syntactical status [thereof]; the predicate of the subject [is the following]) who provides for you from 
the heaven, rain, and, from the, earth?, vegetation (the interrogative is [actually] an affirmative, that is 
to say, ‘there is no creator or provider other than Him). There is no god except Him. So how then do you 
deviate?, how are you turned away from affirming His Oneness when you already affirm that He is the 
Creator and the Provider?  And if they deny you, O Muhammad (s), with regard to your coming with [the message of] God’s 
Oneness, resurrection, reckoning and punishment, verily [other] messengers before you were denied, in 
this re^eCt, so be Steadfast as they were Steadfast; and to God all matters are returned, in the Hereafter, 
when He will requite the deniers and grant victory to the messengers.","All praise be to Allah, the Originator of the heavens and earth, Who made the angels messengers with two, three, or four wings. He increases in creation whatever He wills. Indeed, Allah is Most Capable of all things. . Whatever mercy Allah opens up for people, none can withhold it; and whatever He withholds, none can release it thereafter, for He is the All-Mighty, All-Wise. . O people, remember Allah’s favor upon you. Is there any creator other than Allah who gives you provision from heaven and earth? None has the right to be worshiped except Him. How can you then be deluded? . If they reject you, there were messengers rejected before you; it is to Allah that all matters will be returned.",
35,5,8,"O mankind! Indeed God’s promise, of resurrection and of other issues, is true. So do not let the 
life of this world deceive you, from believing in [all of] that, and do not let the Deceiver, Satan, deceive 
you concerning God, on account of His forbearance and reciting [of sinners in this life]. Truly Satan is an enemy to you. So treat him as an enemy, by being obedient to God and do not 
obey him; he only summons his faction, his followers in disbelief, so that they may be among the inhab¬ 
itants of the Blaze, the fierce Fire. Those who disbelieve, theirs will be a severe chastisement; but those who believe and perform 
righteous deeds, theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward — this is a declaration of what [fate] will 
be for the adherents of Satan and what will be for his opponents [respectively]. The following was revealed regarding Abu Jahl and others: Is he, the evil of whose deeds is made 
[ to seem] fair to him, by distortion, so that he deems it good [...]? ( a-fa-man, ‘is he [whose]’ constitutes 
the subject, the predicate of which is [an omitted] ‘like one whom God has guided?’ No! And this [predi¬ 
cate] is indicated by [what follows]). Indeed God leads aStray whomever He will and guides whomever 
He will. So do not let your soul expire for their sake, for those to whom it has made [to seem] fair, out 
ofsighings, by becoming anguished leSt they do not believe. Indeed God is Knower of what they do, and 
He will requite them for it.","O people, indeed Allah’s promise is true, so do not let the life of this world deceive you, nor let the Chief Deceiver [Satan] deceive you concerning Allah. . Indeed, Satan is an enemy to you, so take him as an enemy. He only calls his followers to be among the inmates of the Blazing Fire. . Those who disbelieve will have a severe punishment, but those who believe and do righteous deeds will have forgiveness and a great reward. . Is one whose evil deed is made appealing to him so he deems it good [like one who is rightly guided]? It is Allah who causes to stray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. So do not let yourself collapse in grief for them. Allah is All-Knowing of what they do.",

Hereafter, and it cannot be obtained from Him except through obedience to Him, so let such [a one] 
be obedient to Him. To Him ascends good words, that is to say, He is aware of such [good words], and 
these are [Statements such as] ‘there is no god except God’ and the like; and as for righteous action, He 
exalts it. He accepts it; but those who plot evil, schemes againSt the Prophet — [as was the case] at the 
council assembly, in the way of imprisoning him, killing him or expelling him, as mentioned in [surat] 
al-Anfal [Q. 8:30] — theirs shall be a severe chastisement and their plotting shall come to nothing: it 
shall be ruined. And God created you from duSt, by having created your father Adam from it, then from a drop 
of [seminal] fluid, in other words, from SJierm, by creating his seed from it; then He made you pairs, 
males and females. And no female bears or brings forth except with His knowledge ( ilia bi-‘ilmihi is a 
circumstantial qualifier, in other words, ‘[except] that it is known by Him) and no long-living person is 
given long life, in other words, the life of none is increased for one who has a long life, nor is anything 
diminished of his life, in other words, [of the life of] that same long-living person or some other long- 
living person, but it is [recorded] in a Book, namely, the Preserved Tablet. Surely that is easy for God.","It is Allah Who sends the winds which stir up clouds, then We drive them to a dead land and revive therewith the earth after its death. Such will be the Resurrection. . Whoever seeks honor, then all honor belongs to Allah alone. To Him ascend good words, and righteous deeds raise them[1]. But those who plan evil deeds there will be a severe punishment for them, and the plans of such people will perish. . It is Allah Who created you from dust[2], then from a drop of semen, and then He made you into pairs[3]. No female conceives nor gives birth without His knowledge. None is given long life or cut short of his life except that it is in a Record[4]. That is surely easy for Allah.","[1] To Allah, i.e., righteous deeds are confirmation of what is uttered by the tongue. . [2] i.e., your father, Adam. [3] i.e., into males and females.

35,12,14,"Nor are the two [kinds of] seas alike: this one is extremely sweet, pleasant to drink and that one 
is salty, extremely bitter. Yet from each, of the two, you eat fresh meat, namely, fish, and obtain, from 
the salt — and it is also said, from both of them — ornaments which you wear, namely, pearls and coral. 
And you see, you sight, the ships therein, in each of the two [seas], ploughing through ( mawdkhira, in 
other words, tamkhuru’l-ma a, meaning, ‘it cleaves it as it makes its way through it, coming and going by

you may give thanks, to God for this [bounty]. He, God, makes the night pass, enter, into the day, so that it becomes longer, and He makes the 
day pass into the night, so that it becomes longer, and He has disposed the sun and the moon, each, of

own your [idolatrous] associations, in other words, your associating them with God [in power], that is 
to say, they will declare themselves innocent of you and of your worship of them. And none can inform 
you, about the .date in the two abodes, like One Who is Aware, Knower, and this is God, exalted be He.","The two bodies of water are not alike: one is fresh and palatable, pleasant to drink, and the other is salty and bitter. Yet from each you eat fresh meat and extract ornaments to wear. And you see the ships traverse their way through both, so that you may seek His bounty and so that you may give thanks. . He merges the night into the day and the day into the night, and subjected the sun and the moon, each running its course for an appointed term. Such is Allah, your Lord. To Him belongs the dominion, whereas those whom you invoke besides Him do not own so much as the membrane of a date stone. .

pendent, [without any need] of His creatures, the Praised, the One Who is praised in whatever He does 
with them. If He will, He can take you away and bring about a new creation, instead of you. And that is not an arduous thing for God. And no burdened soul shall bear the burden of another [sinful soul]. And should one, soul, 
burdened heavily, with sin, call for, some of, its burden to be borne, by another, nothing of it will be 
borne, even if, the one called, be a relative, kin, such as a father or a son — the impossibility of ‘having 
something borne [by another]’ in both instances is something ordained by God. You can only warn 
those who fear their Lord in secret, in other words, those who fear Him despite not having seen Him, for 
they are the ones to benefit from the warning, and observe the prayer, maintain [performance of] it. For

himself only for [ the sake of] his own soul, because the reforming of his self pertains to him. And to God

If He wills, He can eliminate you and bring in a new creation, . for that is not difficult for Allah. . No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another. If a heavily-laden soul calls for help to bear its burden, nothing of it will be carried, even if he is a close relative. You can only warn those who fear their Lord unseen[6] and establish prayer.

35,19,26,"Nor are the blind and the seer equal, that is, the disbeliever and the believer [are not equal], nor darkness — disbelief — and light — faith; nor shade and torrid heat, namely, Paradise and the Fire; nor are the living equal to the dead, the believers and the disbelievers [repetitively] (the addi¬ 
tion of the particle la, ‘nor’, in all three instances is for emphasis). Indeed God makes to hear whomever 
He will, to be guided, so that such [a person] then reponds to Him by embracing faith. But you cannot 
make those who are in the graves to hear, namely, the disbelievers — whom He has likened to the dead 
— [to hear] and so repond. You are but a Warner, to them. Truly We have sent you with the truth, with [right] guidance, as a bearer of good tidings, to him 
who reponds to it, and a Warner, to him who does not repond to it. And there is not a community but 
there has passed, there has been, in it a Warner, a prophet to warn it. And if they, that is, the people of Meccans, deny you, those before them also denied: their mes¬ 
sengers brought them manifest signs, miracles, and with scriptures, such as the scrolls of Abraham, and 
with the illuminating Book, namely, the Torah and the Gopel, so endure [patiently] as they endured. Then I seized those who disbelieved, for their denial, and how was My abhorrence!, [how was]

this is] because [religious] obligations no longer apply therein (the second of these [‘fatigue’], which is 
consequent upon the firSt [‘toil’], is mentioned in order to make explicit the non-exiStence [of any toil 
in Paradise]). ","Those who recite the Book of Allah, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them, secretly and openly, hoping for a deal that will suffer no loss, . so that He will reward them in full and give them more out of His bounty[14]. He is All-Forgiving, Most Appreciative. . The Book that We have revealed to you [O Prophet] is the truth, confirming that which came before it. Indeed, Allah is All-Aware and All-Seeing of His slaves. . Then We made to inherit the Book those whom We have chosen from among Our slaves[15]. But among them are some who wrong themselves, some follow a middle course, and some are foremost in good deeds with Allah’s permission. That is the great bounty. . They will enter Gardens of Eternity; they will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their garments will be of silk. . And they will say, “All praise be to Allah Who has taken away from us all sorrow. Indeed, our Lord is All-Forgiving, Most Appreciative, . He Who has caused us to settle – out of His grace – in the everlasting home, wherein no weariness or fatigue will touch us.”","[14] i.e., Allah gives much in return for little. . [15] i.e., the Prophet Muhammad’s (ﷺ) followers."
35,36,38,"And as for those who disbelieve, there will be for them the fire of Hell: they will neither be done 
away with, through death, so that they may die, and find red, nor will any [afpedl] of its chastisement 
be lightened for them, [not even for] a single moment. 2 In this way, in the way that We requite these, 
We requite every ingrate, [every] disbeliever (read yujza kullu kafurin, ‘every ingrate is [so] requited’; or 
najzi kulla kafurin, ‘[so] We requite every ingrate’). While therein they will be crying out, calling for help in distress, howling and saying: ‘Our Lord! 
Bring us forth, from it, and we will ad righteously, other than how we used to ad’. But it will be said 
to them: ‘Did We not give you long life, enough, time, in which to take heed, for him who would take 
heed? And [moreover] the Warner, the Messenger, came to you, but you did not respond to his call, so 
taSte now [ this chastisement]! For the evildoers, the disbelievers, have no helper’, to ward off from them 
the chastisement. Truly God is Knower of the Unseen of the heavens and the earth; truly He knows well what is in 
the breaSts, what is in the hearts — thus there is all the more reason that He should [also] have knowl¬ 
edge of other things, given the way people are.","As for those who disbelieve, there will be the Fire of Hell; neither will they be sentenced to death, so that they may die, nor will its punishment be lightened for them. This is how We recompense every disbeliever. . They will be screaming therein, “Our Lord, take us out; we will do righteous deeds, unlike what we used to do.” [They will be told], “Did We not give you long enough lives to take heed for anyone who wished to take heed? And the warner did come to you. So taste! The wrongdoers will have no helper.” . Allah is the Knower of the unseen in the heavens and earth. He is All-Knowing of what is in the hearts.",
35,39,41,"It is He Who made you successors in the earth ( khalaif ‘successors’, is the plural of khalifa) in 
other words, one succeeding the other. So whoever disbelieves, of you, his disbelief will be to his own 
detriment, that is, the evil consequences of his disbelief [will be so]. And their disbelief does not increase 
the disbelievers with their Lord [in anything] except disfavour, wrath. And their disbelief does not in¬ 
crease the disbelievers [in anything] except loss, of [the reward of] the Hereafter. Say: ‘Have you considered your associates on whom you call, [those whom] you worship, be¬ 
sides God?, in other words, other than God — and they are the idols whom you asserted to be partners 
of God, exalted be He. Show me, apprise me of, what [part] of the earth they have created. Or do they 
have some partnership, some share alongside God, in, the creation of, the heavens?’ Or have We given 
them a scripture, so that they are [adding] upon a clear proof, a definitive argument, therefrom?, to the 
effecft that they have some partnership with Me? Nothing of the sort! Nay, but the evildoers, the disbe¬ 
lievers, promise one another nothing but delusion, falsehood, when they say that the idols will intercede 
for them. Truly God sustains the heavens and the earth left they disappear, in other words, He prevents 
them from disappearing. And if(wa-la-in\ the lam is for oaths) they were to disappear there is none that 
can sustain them after Him, in other words, other than Him. Truly He is ever Forbearing, Forgiving, in 
deferring the punishment of the disbelievers.","It is He Who has made you successors on earth. Whoever disbelieves will bear the burden of his disbelief. Their disbelief only increases the disbelievers in contempt before their Lord, and their disbelief only increases the disbelievers in loss. . Say, “Tell me about your associate-gods whom you supplicate besides Allah. Show me what they created on earth, or do they have a share in the heavens? Or have We given them a Book so they have clear proof? No, the wrongdoers promise one another nothing but delusion[16].” . Allah keeps the heavens and earth from vanishing. If they were to vanish, there is none to sustain them other than Him. He is Most Forbearing, All-Forgiving.",[16] By giving their followers deceptive hopes that their false deities will intercede for them with Allah.

would be more readily guided than any one of the communities, [than] the Jews, the Christians or oth¬ 
ers, in other words, [more readily guided] than any one of these — having [themselves] seen the extent 
to which these [groups] called each other liars, given that: The Jews say, ‘The Christians Stand on nothing’, 
and the Christians say, ‘The Jews Stand on nothing’, [Q. 2:113]. But when a Warner, namely, Muhammad 
(5), did come to them, this, coming of his, only increased them in aversion, further away from [right] 
guidance, aiding with disdain in the land, again St faith (iStikbaranfi’l-ardi, an objedt denoting reason) and 
devising, adts of, evil, in the way of idolatry and otherwise; and evil schemes will beset, surround, only 
their authors, namely, the one who devises [such evil] (the qualifying of makr, ‘scheme’, with the noun 
al-sayyi’, ‘evil’, is intrinsic [to the fadt that it is a scheme], and so the annexation of the former to the lat¬

a noun to an adjedtive). So do they expett, do they await, anything but the precedent of the ancients?, 
God’s way [of dealing] with them, such as chastising them for their denial of the messengers? Yet you 
will never find any change in God’s precedent, and you will never find any revision in God’s precedent, 
that is to say, chastisement is never replaced by anything else, nor is it ever meted out other than to the 
one who deserves it. Have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were 
before them — and they were mightier than these in power?, but [Still] God destroyed them for their 
denial of the messengers. And God is not such that anything in the heavens or in the earth can escape 
Him, pre-empt Him or elude Him. Truly He is ever Knower, of all things. Omnipotent. Were God to take mankind to task for what they have acquired, of adts of disobedience, He 
would not leave on its surface, that is, the earth’s, a single creature, a single living thing moving thereon. 
But He reprieves them to an appointed term, namely, [to] the Day of Resurredtion. And when their term

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","They swore by Allah their most solemn oaths that if a warner came to them, they would surely be more guided than any other community. But when a warner came to them, it only added to their aversion – . due to their arrogance in the land and plotting evil, but evil plotting only backfires on its own people. Are they awaiting anything other than the fate of the earlier peoples? You will find no change in Allah’s way[17], and you will find no alteration in Allah’s way[18]. . Have they not traveled in the land to see what was the end of those who came before them. They were more powerful than them? Allah is not such that something can escape Him in the heavens or on earth. He is indeed All-Knowing, Most Capable. . If Allah were to take people to task for what they did, He would not leave a single living being on earth, but He gives them respite for an appointed term. When their appointed time comes, then Allah is All-Seeing of His slaves.","[17] In punishing those who deny the prophets.

36,1,12,"Yd sin: God knows be\ft what He means by these [letters]. By the Definitive Qur’an, made definitive by its marvellous arrangement and unique meanings, you, O Muhammad (s), are indeed of those sent [by God], on a (‘ala is semantically connected to the preceding [Statement]) Straight path, that is, [you fol¬ 
low] the way of the prophets before you, [enjoining] the affirmation of God’s Oneness and guidance (the 
emphasis expressed by the oath [in ‘by the definitive Qur’an ] and the remainder [of the statement] is a 
re^onse to the disbelievers’ saying to him, ‘You have not been sent [by God]!’ [Q. 13:43]. A revelation from the Mighty, in His kingdom, the Merciful, to His creatures (tanzila’l-’azizi’l- 
rahim is the predicate of an implicit subject, namely, al-qur’an), that you may warn, therewith, a people ( qawman, connected to tanzila, ‘a revelation) whose 
fathers were not warned, in the period of the interval (al-fatra),' so they, this people, are oblivious, to 
faith and right guidance. The word, for chastisement, has already proved true, it has become due, for moil of them, for 
they, in other words, mo St of them, will not believe. Indeed We have put fetters around their necks, to bind to them their hands (because ghull [is a fet¬ 
ter that] shackles the hands to the neck), such that they, the hands, are, bound, up to the chins ( adhqan 
is the plural of dhaqan, which is where the two sides of the beard meet) so that their heads are upturned, 
they are unable to lower them: this [Statement] is figurative and is meant to indicate their inability to 
yield to faith or to lower their heads to it. And We have set before them a barrier (read saddan or suddan in both instances) and behind 
them a barrier; so We have covered them, so they do not see — this is also figurative, depicting the way 
in which the paths of faith are closed to them. And it is the same to them whether you warn them (read a-andhartuhum, pronouncing both 
hamzas; or by substituting an alifior the second one; or by not pronouncing the second one but inserting 
an alif between the one not pronounced and the other one, or without [the insertion]) or do not warn 
them, they will not believe. You can only warn, in other words, your warning will only benefit, him who follows the Remem¬ 
brance, the Qur’an, and fears the Compassionate One in secret, who fears Him deSjhte not having seen 
Him; so give him the good tidings of forgiveness and a noble reward, namely, Paradise. Tridy it is We Who bring the dead to life, for the resurrection, and record, in the Preserved Tab¬ 
let, what they have sent ahead, during their lives, of good or evil, that they may be requited for it, and 
their veftiges, what conduct was followed after them as good practice. And everything (kulla shay’in is 
in the accusative because of the verb that governs it [and is the following]) We have numbered. We have 
recorded precisely, in a clear register, a clear Book, namely, the Preserved Tablet.","Yā Sīn[1] . By the Qur’an, full of wisdom, . You [O Muhammad] are indeed one of the messengers, . on a straight path, .

The decree [of punishment] has been passed against most of them, for they will not believe. . [It is as if] We have placed shackles around their necks up to their chins, so their heads are forced to remain up, . and We have placed a barrier before them and a barrier behind them, and have blocked their vision so they cannot see[2]. . It is the same to them whether you warn them or not, they will not believe. . You can only warn one who follows the Reminder[3] and fears the Most Compassionate unseen. So give him glad tidings of forgiveness and a generous reward. .

They said, “Our Lord knows that we are sent to you as messengers. . Our duty is only to convey the message clearly.” . The people said, “We consider you as an evil omen.

the messengers! Follow (ittabTu, this reiterates the preceding [ ittabi’u ]) them who do not ask you for any reward, 
in return for [delivering to you] the message, and who are rightly guided. And so he was asked, ‘Do you 
follow their religion?’ So he replied: And why should I not worship Him Who originated me, [Him Who] created me — in other 
words: there is nothing to prevent me from worshipping Him when the necessitating factors for this ex- 
Ht, and the same applies to you — and to Whom you shall be returned?, after death, whereupon He will

other than Him, [other] gods, idols, whose intercession, [that intercession of theirs] which you assert, if 
the Compassionate One should wish me any harm, will not avail me in any way, nor will they [be able 
to] save me? (wa-la yunqidhun is an adjectival qualification of alihatan, gods’). Truly then, in other words, in the case of me worshipping [gods] other than God, I woidd be in 
manifeft error. Lo! I believe in your Lord. So liften to me!’, in other words, hear what I have to say; but they 
atoned him and he died. 


416 


Sura Yd Sin It was said, to him upon his death: ‘Enter Paradise!’ — but it is also said that he entered it while 
he was [s'tillj alive. He said, ‘O (yd is for calling attention [to something]), woidd that my people knew with what [munificence] my Lord has forgiven me, [would that they knew] of His great forgive¬ 
ness, and made me of the honoured ones!’","A man came from the farthest end of the city, rushing, and said, “O my people, follow the messengers. . Follow those who ask no recompense of you, and who are guided. . Why should I not worship the One Who created me and to Whom you will all be brought back? . Should I take besides Him other gods whose intercession cannot avail me in the least, nor can they come to my rescue, if the Most Compassionate wills to harm me? . Surely I would then be clearly misguided. . I believe in your Lord, so listen to me.” . [But they killed him], so he was told[6], “Enter Paradise.” He said, “If only my people knew[7] . of how my Lord has forgiven me, and made me among the honored ones.”",[6] After he was martyred for the sake of Allah. [7] He said so after Allah admitted him into paradise and he saw the pleasures therein.
36,28,32,"And We did not send (ma here is for negation) down on his people, namely, Habibs, after him, 
after his death, any ho ft from the heaven, that is, any angels to destroy them, nor do We [ever] send 
down, any angels to destroy anyone. It, their punishment, was but one Cry — Gabriel gave a cry to them — and lo! they were extin¬ 
guished, silent, dead. Ah, the anguish for servants, [such as] these and their like from among those who denied the 
messengers and were destroyed (this [word, hasra ] denotes ‘extreme agony’; the vocative here is being 
used metaphorically, in other words, ‘It is time for you [O anguish], so come now!’). Never did a mes¬ 
senger come to them but that they mocked him (this [Statement] is given as an explanation of the cause 
thereof [of the ‘agony’] since it [the statement] entails their mockery which itself results in their being 
destroyed and which in turn is the cause of the ‘anguish’). Have they — that is, those inhabitants of Mecca who said to the Prophet, ‘You have not been sent 
[by God]!’ [Q. 13:43] — not seen, [not] come to know (the interrogative is meant [rhetorically] as an af¬ 
firmative) how many (kam here is predicative [as opposed to interrogative], in other words [it is to be 
understood as] kathiran, ‘many’; it is operated by the Statement that comes next [below] and it comments 
on the operative clause for the Statement that preceded it); the meaning then is as follows: indeed, many, 
generations, communities, We have destroyed before them, [how] that they, the ones destroyed, never 
return?, to those deniers [who are now alive]? So will they not learn from their example? (from anna- 
hum, ‘[how] that they’, to the end [of the verse] is a substitution for the preceding clause [kam ahlaknd 
qablahum mina’l-quruni], bearing in mind the aforementioned general meaning). 2 And indeed (in, is either for negation or is in its softened form) every one of them, that is, 
every single creature (kullun is the subject) will be gathered (jamiun is the predicate of the subjed) 
before Us, at the Scene, following their resurrection, arraigned (muhdaruna is a second predicate) for 
the Reckoning (read lamma with the sense of ilia, or lama with the lam functioning as a separator and 
the ma being extra). 3","After his death, We did not send down any soldiers from heaven against his people, nor did We have to do so. . It was no more than a single blast, and immediately they were extinguished. . Alas for the humans! No messenger ever comes to them but they ridicule him. . Do they not see how many generations We destroyed before them who will never come back to them[8]? . Yet all of them will be brought before Us.","[8] i.e., to the life of this world."
36,33,47,"And a sign for them, of the [truth of] resurrection (wa-dyatun lahum is a preceding predicate) is 
the dead earth (read maytatu or mayyitatu) which We revive, with water (ahyayndhd is the subject) and 
out of which We bring forth grain, such as wheat, so that they eat thereof; and We have placed therein gardens, orchards, of date-palms and vines, and We have caused, a 
number of, firings to gush forth therein, that they might eat of its fruits (read thamarihi or thumurihi ) in other words, [of] the fruits of 
the mentioned date-palms and otherwise; but it was not their hands that made it, namely, they did not 
cultivate the fruits. Will they not then give thanks?, for His favours to them, exalted be He? Glory be to Him Who created all the pairs, the ,f]iecimens, of what the earth produces, of seeds 

2 In other words, the question being asked is two-fold: ‘Have they not seen how many generations We have destroyed?’ and, reading 
in the substitution, ‘Have they not seen that they do not return?’. The meaning to be borne in mind is that the Statement is rhetori¬ 
cal: ‘Many generations have We destroyed and none of them have ever returned’. 

3 This grammatical comment belongs earlier, after lamma , but it is has been left to the end because the two alternative readings 
indicated at the Start, and dependent on the understanding of wa-in, cannot be simultaneously reconciled in the English transla¬ 
tion within the Qur’anic text. The rendition given above is with wa-in if read as the softened form of wa-inna, ‘and indeed’, so that 
lamma is essentially otiose (apart from the separator function of the lam). The alternative would be to read the Statement with the 
negative construction wa-in ... lamma, which, though cumbersome in English, would be something along the lines of: ‘and there 
is not one of them but that he will be gathered before Us, present’.

and other things, and of themselves, of males and females, and of what they do not know, of marvellous 
and strange creatures. And a sign for them, of the tremendous power [of God], is the night, from which We Ttrip, 
We separate, the day and, behold, they find themselves in darkness, passing into the darkness [of 
the night]. And the sun [which] runs (from wa’l-shamsu tajri to the end [of the statement] is subsumed by 
[the introductory] wa-dyatun lahum, ‘and a sign for them’; alternatively, it constitutes another sign [for 
them]; similar is the case with wa’l-qamara, ‘and the moon [further below]) to its resting-place, in other 
words, it does not overStep it. That, namely, its running, is the ordaining of the Mighty, in His kingdom, 
the Knower, of His creation. And the moon — (read wa’l-qamaru, in the nominative, or wa’l-qamara, in the accusative; and it 
maybe in the accusative because of a following verb that governs it) We have determined it, with reSJieCt 
to its course, [to run] in phases — twenty eight phases in twenty eight nights of every month; it becomes 
concealed for two nights when the month has thirty days, and for one night when it has twenty nine days 
— until it returns, during its final phase seeming to the [human] eye, like an aged palm-bough, in other 
words, like the Stalk with a date cluster when it ages, becoming delicate, arched and yellowish. It does not behove — it is [neither] facilitated nor is it right for — the sun to catch up with the 
moon, and so appear together with it at night, nor may the night outrun the day, and thus it [the night] 
never arrives before the latter ends and each ( kullun: the nunation compensates for the [missing] geni¬ 
tive annexation [that would have been constructed] with al-shams, ‘the sun’, al-qamar, ‘the moon, and 
al-nujum, ‘the Stars’) [of these] is in an orbit, swimming, moving — these [celestial bodies] are being 
treated as [though they were] rational beings. And a sign for them, of Our power, is that We carried their seed ( dhurriyatahum : a variant 
reading has dhurriyyatihim ), that is to say, their original ancestors, in the laden Ark, that is, Noah’s fully- 
loaded ship, and We have created for them the like of it, that is, the like of Noah’s Ark, namely, the small 
and large ships resembling it which they have made, by the instruction of God, exalted be He, in which 
they ride. And if We will, We drown them, deSJiite the existence of ships [for them to ride safely in], whereat 
they have no one to call to, [none] to succour [them], nor are they rescued, delivered — except by a mercy from Us and for an enjoyment until some time, in other words, they can only 
be saved by Our showing them mercy and Our permitting them to enjoy those pleasures of theirs until 
their terms [of life] are concluded. And when it is said to them, ‘Beware of that which is before you, of the chastisement of this 
world, as [it is said] to others, and that which is behind you, of the chastisement of the Hereafter, that 
perhaps you might find mercy’, they turn away [in aversion]. And never did a sign of the signs of their Lord come to them, but that they turned away from it. And when it is said, that is, [when] the poor ones from among the Companions [of the Prophet] 
say, to them: ‘Expend, on us, of what God has provided you’, of wealth, those who disbelieve say to those 
who believe, in mockery of them: ‘Are we to feed those whom, if God willed, He would feed?, as you 
are wont to believe? You, in saying this to us, together with this believe of yours, are only in manifest 
error!’ — as an explicit declaration of their disbelief this [Statement] is very effective [in the way that it 
has been expressed].","There is a sign for them in the dead land: We give it life and produce from it grain for them to eat. . And We have made therein gardens of palm trees and grapevines, and caused springs to gush forth, . so that they may eat of its fruit that was not made by their hands[9]. Will they not then give thanks? . Glory be to the One Who created all types of things[10] that the earth produces, and of themselves, and of things that they have no knowledge about. . There is another sign for them in the night: We strip from it the daylight, and they are left in darkness. . The sun is running to its determined course. That is the design of the All-Mighty, All-Knowing. . As for the moon, We have determined phases for it, until it becomes like an old palm stalk. . It is not for the sun to catch up with the moon, nor for the night to outstrip the day. Each is floating in its own orbit. . Another sign for them is that We carried their offspring[11] in the loaded Ark, . and We created for them similar things on which they ride. . If We willed, We could drown them, then there would be no one to respond to their cry, nor could they be rescued, . except by a mercy from Us, leaving them to enjoy for a while. . When it is said to them, “Beware of what is ahead of you and what is behind you[12], so that you may be shown mercy[13].” .

Sura Yd Sin God, exalted be He,says: They await but a single Cry, namely [the cry of] Israfil’s First Bla.ft, that 
will seize them while they are disputing (read yakhassimuna, which is actually yakhtasimuna, where the 
vowel of the ta’ has been moved to the khd’ and it [the td’] has been assimilated with the sad, in other 
words: while they are oblivious to it, busily engaged in dilutes, concluding bargains, eating and drink¬ 
ing and so on; a variant reading has yakhsimuna similar [in pattern] to yadribuna, in which case the 
meaning is: while they dilute with one another). Then they will not be able to make any testament, that is, to make a bequest, nor will they return 
to their folk, from their markets and their businesses, rather they will die then and there. And the Trumpet is blown — this is the Horn — at the second Blait for the Resurrection [to take 
place]; between the two Blasts is an interval of forty years; and lo! they, those interred, will be scrambling 
out of their graves towards their Lord, emerging therefrom hurriedly. They, the disbelievers among them, will say, ‘O (yd is for calling attention [to something]) woe 
to us! (waylana means haldkand, ‘[O] our destruction!’, and it is a verbal noun which has no [regular] 
verbal conjugation) Who has raised us from our place of sleep?, [they say this] because they will have 
been asleep in the interval between the two blasts and will not have been punished [yet]. 77 i is, that is, 
[this] raising, is that which the Compassionate One had promised and, regarding which, the messengers 
had spoken the truth’: they affirm [this truth] when such affirmation is no longer of any benefit to them 
— but it is also said that this is said to them. 4 It is but a single Cry, and, behold, they will all be arraigned before Us! So today no soul shall be wronged in anyway, and you shall not be requited, except, the requital 
of, what you used to do.","They say, “When will this promise come to pass, if you are truthful?” . They are not awaiting but a single Blast that will seize them while they are still disputing[14]. . Then they will not be able to make a will, nor will they be able to return to their households. . The Trumpet will be blown[15] [again], and at once they will rush from their graves to their Lord. . They will say, “Woe to us! Who has resurrected us from our resting place?” [They will be told,] “This is what the Most Compassionate promised, and the messengers told the truth.” . It will only be a single Blast, and at once they will all be brought before Us. . On that Day no soul will be wronged in the least, nor will you be recompensed except for what you used to do.","[14] The first blast (lit., a cry or a shriek) of the Trumpet will take them by surprise on the Day of Judgment while they will be disputing in their worldly affairs. . [15] i.e., the second blast or blow."

to what the inhabitants of the Fire are suffering, [busy] delighting in pleasures such as deflowering vir¬ 
gins — not busy with anything wearisome, as there is no toil in Paradise — rejoicing, blissful (fdkihuna 
is a second predicate of inna, the fir£t being ft shugulin, ‘busy’); they (hum, the subject) and their spouses, beneath the shade (zilal is the plural of zulla or zill,

a second predicate, connected to ‘aid, ‘upon’) couches (araik is the plural of arika, which is a bed inside 
a curtained canopy, or the bedding therein). They have fruits therein and, therein, they have whatever they call for, [whatever] they 
wish for. “Peace!” (saldmun is a subject) — the word (qawlan is its predicate), that is, [peace] byway of a 
word, from a Lord [Who is] Merciful, to them, in other words, He says to them, ‘Peace be on you!’","Indeed, on that Day the people of Paradise will be busy enjoying themselves, . they and their spouses will be reclining on couches in the shade. .

you shoidd not worship Satan, [that you should] not obey him; truly he is a manifest enemy to you, one 
whose enmity is evident, and that [you should] worship Me, [and that you should] affirm My Oneness and obey Me —

limb will SJieak of that [sinful acftion] which issued from it. And had We willed We would have obliterated their eyesight. We would have rendered them 
blind by obliterating them, then, they [would have tried to] advance towards the path, to be on their 
way as usual, but how would they have seen?, then. In other words, they would not have been to see. And had We willed We would have transformed them, [into] apes or swine or Stones, in their 
place ( makanatihim, variant reading has makanatihim, the plural of makana, meaning makan, in other 
words ‘in their dwellings’); then they would have neither been able to go ahead nor to return, in other 
words, they would not then be able to come and go. And whomever We give long life, by prolonging his term [of life], We cause him to regress ( nan- 
kushu; a variant reading has [2 nd verbal form] nunakkishu, derived from al-tankis) in creation, that is, 
in terms of his physical form, so that after having enjoyed Strength and youth, he becomes feeble and 
decrepit. Will they then not understand?, that One Who is able to effedt such [a State] — with which they 
are familiar — is also able to resurrect, that they might then become believers? (a variant reading [for 
ya’qiluna, ‘they understand’] has [the second person plural] taqiluna, ‘you understand’).","“Stand apart [from the believers] this Day, O wicked ones! . Did I not command you, O children of Adam, not to worship Satan, for he is your sworn enemy, . but to worship Me? This is a straight path. . He had already misled great multitudes of you. Did you not then have sense? . This is the Hell that you were promised. . Burn in it Today for your disbelief[17].” . Today We will seal up their mouths, and their hands will speak to Us, and their feet will testify to all what they used to do. . If We willed, We could have taken away their sight, so they would rush to find their way, but then how could they see? . And if We willed, We could have paralyzed them in their places[18], so they could neither move forward nor backward. . Whomsoever We give a long life, We cause his strength to decline[19].

36,69,70,"And We did not teach him, that is, the Prophet , poetry — this was [revealed] to refute their say¬ 
ing, ‘This Qur’an that he has brought is but poetry!’ — nor is it, poetry, seemly, [nor is it] facilitated, for

are rot?’, in other words, [when they have become] withered (He does not say ramimatun, ‘decayed’,

replies here. And He is the Creator ( khallaq means Creator of many things), the Knower, of all things. His command. His affair, when He wills a thing, that is, [when He will] to create something, is

mindful, they do not heed the admonition, and when they see a sign, such as the flitting of the moon [cf. Q. 54:1], they make it an object

them: ‘This is the Day of Retribution’, the Day of Reckoning and Requital. ‘This is the Day of Judgement, between [all] creatures, that you used to deny!’","So ask them, “Are they more difficult to create or other things We created?

Tafsir al-Jalalayn And we did not have any warrant, any sway or power, over you, to compel you to follow us. Nay, 
but you [yourselves] were a rebellious folk, astray, like us. So our Lord’s Words, of chastisement — namely, His Words: ‘Verily I shall fill Hell with jinn and

follows — when it was said to them, ‘There is no god except God’, used to be scornful, and would say, ‘Are we to abandon our gods for a mad poet?’, that is, for the sake of what 
Muhammad (s) says? (as regards the hamzas [in a-inna, ‘are we’], the same applies as mentioned above). God, exalted be He, says: Nay, but he has brought [them] the truth and confirmed the [earlier] 
messengers, namely, those who had also brought this [truth], which is that there is no god except God. ‘You shall certainly (there is a shift from the third person address [to the second] here) taSte the

[The misleaders] will say, “Rather, you yourselves were not believers, . and We had no power over you, rather you yourselves were a transgressing people. . Now the punishment of our Lord has come true against us; we will surely taste it. . We did misguide you, for we ourselves were misguided”. . On that Day they will all share in the punishment. . This is how We deal with the wicked, . for whenever it was said to them, “None has the right to be worshiped except Allah,” they became arrogant, . and said, “Are we going to abandon our gods for a mad poet[7]?” .

regarding what they experienced in the [life of the] world. One of them will say, ‘Indeed I had a comrade, a companion who used to reject [the idea of] 
resurrection, who used to say, to me in reproach, “Areyou really among those who affirm as truth, the Resur¬ 
rection [and], 

[ 37 : 53 ] [that] when we are dead and have become duSt and bones, we shall actually be called to ac¬ 
count?’”, that we shall be requited and reckoned with — he rejecfts [the truth of] this as well (as regards 
all three instances of the hamzas [sc. a-innaka, a-idha, and a-innd] what has been mentioned above 
[applies]).  He, the one peaking, says, to his brethren [in Paradise], ‘Willyou have a look?’, together with 
me into the Fire, to see his condition — but they will say, ‘No’. Then he, that Weaker, will take a look, through one of the apertures in Paradise, and he will 
catch sight of him, that is, he will see his comrade, in the centre of Hell, in the middle of the Fire. He will say, to him, acknowledging that he [the latter] deserves his fate: ‘By God! You very nearly 
destroyed me, you [almost] ruined me through your misguidance (in, this has been softened from the 
hardened form [inna]). 

[ 37 : 57 ] And had it not been for the favour of my Lord, His grace to me in giving me faith, I [too] would 
have been of those arraigned’, with you, in the Fire. The inhabitants of Paradise will say:  Do we then not die [anymore], aside from ourfirSt death, that is, the one [which we suffered] in this world, and are we not to 
be chastised?’ — this interrogative statement is one made out of [sheer] delight and in order to SJieak 
[at length] of the graces of God, exalted be He, in [His] granting of everlasting life and refraining from 
inflicting any punishment. Truly this, that has mentioned [as being the reward] for the inhabitants of Paradise, is indeed 
the mighty success. For the like of this let [all] the workers work — it is said that this is said to them, or it is what 
they say [themselves].","Then they will turn to one another asking[12]. .

He will say[14], “Do you wish to see [his fate]?” . So he will look down and see him[15] in the midst of the Blazing Fire. . He will say, “By Allah, you were about to ruin me. . Were it not for the grace of my Lord, I would have been among those who are brought [to Hell].” .

they end up hurrying towards it [Hell-fire].

of turiduna, ‘you desire’; ifk denotes the word kind of lie). In other words: do you worship [any] other 
than God? What then is your supposition regarding the Lord of the Worlds?’, having worshipped other 
than Him, [do you think] that He will leave you without punishment? No! They were a people of as¬ 
trologers. On one occasion, they went out to celebrate a festival of theirs and left their food behind with 
their idols, claiming that they were securing thereby blessings for it and that they would eat it upon their 
return. They had said to the lord Abraham: ‘Come out with us’. And he caSl a glance at the Stars — to delude them into thinking that he relies on them, so that 
they would then trud him — and said, ‘Indeed I feel [I will be] sick’, that is, I will fall ill. So they went away, to their fedival, leaving him behind. Then he turned, he dole away, to their gods, the idols, in front of which the food had been placed, 
and said, mockingly: ‘Will you noteat? — but they failed to utter [a word]. He then said: What is wrong with you that you do not Speak?’ — but [dill] he received no re.<]x>nse. He then turned on them Striking [them] with his right hand, with might, smashing them. Those 
who saw him reported this to [the red of] his people. 

[ 37 : 94 ] So they came running towards him, walking hurriedly, and they said to him, ‘We worship them 
while you smash them?!’  He said, to them in reproach: ‘Do you worship what you [yourselves] have carved, out of done 
and other materials, idols, when God created you and whatever you make?’, [whether it be] your ad of carving and that 
which you have carved? So worship Him alone! (the ma [in wa-ma tamaluna, ‘and whatever you make’] 
is that of the verbal noun; but it is also said to introduce a relative clause, or it is adjecftivally qualified). They said, amongd themselves: ‘Buildfor him a Structure, then fill it with firewood and set it on 
fire, and when it is ablaze, then caSl him into the fierce fire’. So they sought to outwit him, by flinging him into the fire, so that it may dedroy him, but We 
made them the lowermost, the vanquished, as he came out of the fire unharmed.","Indeed, Abraham was one of those who followed his way. . When he came to his Lord with a sound heart, . and said to his father and his people, “What are you worshiping? . Is it false gods that you seek other than Allah? . Then what do you think of the Lord of the worlds?” . He then cast a glance at the stars[20], . and said, “I am sick[21].” . So they went away from him and left. . Then he turned to their gods and said, “Why do you not eat[22]? . What is wrong with you that you do not speak?” . Then he turned upon them, striking them with his right hand. . Then his people came rushing towards him. . He said, “Do you worship what you yourselves carve, . when it is Allah Who created you and all what you do?” . They said, “Build a pyre for him and throw him into the blazing fire.” . They contrived a plan against him, but We made them the lowest.","[20] His people had faith in astrology, so Abraham pretended to do the same to show them that he was not able to join them at their pagan feast and to remain in their temple of idols, while he was planning to destroy their idols. . [21] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Ibrahim (peace be upon him) did not lie except for three lies: His saying {I am sick} and his saying {Rather, the chief of them did this} and his saying about his wife, “She is my sister.” [Al-Bukhāri, Muslim].

disbelief — He will guide me, to the place to which My Lord has commanded that I end up in, and this 
was Syria. When he reached the Holy Land, he said: My Lord! Grant me, a child, of the righteous’. So We gave him the good tidings of a forbearing son. And when he was old enough to walk with him, that is, to go about with him and help him out 
— this is said to have been [either] at the age of seven or at the age of thirteen — he said, ‘O my dearson, 
I see, that is, I have seen, in a dream that I shall sacrifice you — and the visions of prophets are [always] 
true and their acftions are [injured j by the command of God, exalted be He. So see what you think’, of 
this dream. He consulted him so that he [his son] might accept the idea of being sacrificed and comply 
with the command for it. He said, ‘O my father (the [final] ta [in abati\ replaces the ya of the genitive

Tafsir al-Jalalayn And when they had both submitted, [when] they had submitted to and were prepared to com¬ 
ply with Gods command, exalted be He, and he had laid him down on his forehead, [when] he had 
pushed him down to the ground thereon — every human being has two brows (jabin ) between which is 
the forehead (jabha ); this was at Mina. Abraham passed the knife across his [sons] throat but it did not 
do anything, by some impediment of the Divine Power, We called to him, ‘O Abraham! Verily you have fulfilled the vision’, by what you have done, in that you were able to go through 
with the acft of sacrifice. In other words, that [which you have done] suffices for you [as redemption] (the 
statement nadaynahu, ‘We called to him’, is the response to the lamma, ‘when’, so that the waw [in wa- 
nadaynahu, ‘We called to him] is extra). So, in the same way that We have rewarded you, do We reward 
those who are virtuous, to their own souls in obeying the Command [of God], by removing from them 
their distress. Truly this, sacrifice to which he was commanded, was indeed a clear teSt’, that is to say, the 
ultimate teSt [of faith]. Then We ransomed him, the one whom he had been commanded to sacrifice, namely, Ishmael 
or Isaac — two different opinions — with a mighty sacrifice, [a mighty] ram from Paradise, the same 
one that Abel had offered as as sacrifice: Gabriel, peace be upon him, brought it and the lord Abraham 
sacrificed it as he cried, Allahu akbar, ‘God is Great’. And We left. We preserved, for him among posterity, fair praise [namely]: ‘Peace, from Us, be to Abraham!’ So, in way that We rewarded him, do We reward those who are virtuous, to their own souls. Indeed he is one of Our faithful servants. And We gave him the good tidings of [the birth of] Isaac — some have argued that this proves 
that the one who was sacrificed was not him [Isaac] — a prophet (nabiyyan is a future circumstantial 
qualifier, that is to say, ‘he will come to be, with his prophethood decreed), one of the righteous. 

[37:n3] And We blessed him, by multiplying his descendants, and Isaac, his son, [We also blessed] by 
appointing the majority of prophets from among his progeny. And among their descendants is he who 
is virtuous, [he who is] a believer, and he who plainly wrongs his soul, [he who is] a disbeliever, whose 
disbelief is manifest. ","He said, “I am going to my Lord; He will guide me. . My Lord, grant me righteous offspring.” . So We gave him glad tidings of a forbearing boy[23]. . Then when he reached the age where he could work with him, Abraham said, “O my dear son, I have seen in a dream that I must sacrifice you. What do you think?” He said, “O my dear father, do as you are commanded. You will find me, if Allah wills, one of the steadfast.” . When they both submitted [to Allah’s command] and Abraham laid him on his forehead, . and We called out to him, “O Abraham, . You have fulfilled the dream.” This is how We reward those who do good. . This was indeed a revealing test. . And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice[24], . and We left for him [a favorable mention] among later generations: . “Peace be upon Abraham.” . This is how We reward those who do good. . He was one of Our believing slaves. . And We gave him the glad tidings of Isaac[25], a prophet, and one of the righteous. . We blessed him[26] and Isaac, but among their offspring were some who did good and some who clearly wronged themselves.","[23] i.e., Ishmael . [24] Allah Almighty sent a ram to be sacrificed in place of Ishmael. . [25] The birth of Isaac is mentioned after the story of sacrifice, which verifies that the firstborn son who was sacrificed was indeed Ishmael and not Isaac, contrary to what is claimed by the Jews and Christians. This is also supported by 11:71, where Sarah is told that she would give birth to Isaac, who would have a son by the name of Jacob. . [26] Abraham or Ishmael."
37,114,122,"Andverily We favoured Moses and Aaron, with prophethood, and We delivered them and their people, the Children of Israel, from the great distress, namely,

punishments and rulings and otherwise are excellently expressed — this is the Torah. And We guided them to the Straight path, [the Straight] way, and We left. We preserved, for them among posterity, fair praise [namely]: ‘Peace, from Us, be to Moses and Aaron!’ So, juSt as We rewarded them both, do We reward the virtuous.

brother of Moses; but some say that this [Elias] was some other [person], who was sent to the people 
living in and around Baalbak. When (idh is dependent because of an implicit [verb] udhkur, ‘mention’) he said to his people, 
‘Will you not fear [ God]? Do you call on Baal — this was the name of an idol of theirs which was made of gold, from 
which the name of their city derives, with the addition of [the suffix] bak — that is to say, do you worship 
him, and abandon the Bell of Creators, and not worship Him, God, your Lord, and the Lord of your forefathers?’ (read [as predicates] allahu, rabbukum and 
rabbu, in the nominative, because of the [implicit] omitted huwa [being the subject]; or read allaha, rab- 
bakum and rabba, in the accusative, as supplements to ahsana, ‘the beSt of’). But they denied him. So they will indeed be arraigned, in the Fire, — [all] except God’s delivered servants, namely, the believers, who will be saved from it, and We left for him among posterity, fair praise [namely]: ‘Peace, from Us, be to Elias!’. It is said that this [ilyasin] is [the same] Elias mentioned above; 
but it is also said that this denotes him together with [all] those who were believers with him, and so they 
have been coupled [under the same term] with him being the predominant, as when one might say al- 
Muhallabun, ‘the Muhallabids’, to mean al-Muhallab and his folk; a variant reading has dlydsin, by which 
is meant his family as well as Elias himself. 

[ 37:131] Indeed so — juSt as We rewarded him — do We reward the virtuous.  Truly he is one of Our faithfid servants.

later — and he was sick, ailing like a [newly-born] featherless chick. And We made a gourd plant to grow above him, to provide shade for him with its stem, which 
is not the case usually with gourds, as a miracle for him; a mountain goat would come to him in the 
morning and in the evening and he would drink its milk, until he finally regained his strength. And We sent him, afterwards — as [We had done] before, to a people in Nineveh, in the region 
of Mosul — to a [community of a] hundred thousand or, in fad, more — [a community of] twenty, 
thirty or seventy thousand. And they believed, after they saw [with their own eyes] the chastisement which they had been

pash communities, we would have surely been God’s devoted servants’, [devoting] worship purely to Him. God, exalted be He, says: Yet they disbelieved in it, in other words, in the Book that came to 
them, namely, the Qur’an, more glorious than [all] those other scriptures; but they will come to know, 
the consequences of their disbelief.","And [the pagans] used to say[42], . “If only we had a scripture[43] like the previous people, . we would have surely been true slaves of Allah.” .

38,1,11,"Sad-. God knows bed what He means by this [letter]. By the Qur’an bearing the Remembrance, 
that is, [bearing] the Pronouncement; or [what is meant is that the Qur’an is a Book] of renown (the 
re^onse to this oath has been omitted, in other words: ‘It is not as the Meccan disbelievers say, that there 
are many gods’). Nay, but those who disbelieve, from among the people of Mecca, dwell in conceit, in self-glory 
and [in] disdain of faith, and defiance, disagreement with, and enmity towards, the Prophet (s). How many — in other words, many — a generation, a community of pad communities, We have 
destroyed before them, and they cried out, when the chastisement was sent down on them, when it was 
no longer the time for escape, that is to say, the time was not one for fleeing (the [suffixed] ta [of wa- 
lata\ is extra; the sentence is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of [the verb] nadaw, ‘they 
cried out’) in other words, they called for help but the situation was such that there could be no escape or 
deliverance; but Still the Meccan disbelievers have not taken heed from their example. And they marvel that a Warner has come to them from among themselves, a messenger from 
among their number, to warn them and to threaten them with [the punishment of] the Fire after resur¬ 
rection — and this [warner] is the Prophet (s). And those who disbelieve (the overt noun [ al-kafiruna ] 
has replaced the [third person] pronominalisation) say, ‘This is a sorcerer, a liar. Has he made the gods One God? — for he had said to them, ‘Say: there is no god except God’ 
— in other words [they objedtedj: how could one god suffice for all of creation? Lo! that is indeed a 
curious thing’. And the council from among them go about, from the place of their assembly at the house of Abu 
Talib and [the place] where they heard the Prophet (s) say, ‘Say: there is no god except God’, saying, ‘Go!, 
they say to one another, go, and Stand by your gods, adhere firmly to worship of them; lo! this, that has 
been mentioned concerning the Oneness of God, is indeed a thing sought, from us. We never heard of this in the latter-day creed, namely, the creed of Jesus. This is surely [nothing] 
but an invention, [mere] lies. Has the Remembrance, the Qur’an, been revealed to him, Muhammad (s), out of [all of] us’, 
when he is neither the elder nor the nobleft among us? In other words, it could not have been revealed 
to him (read a-unzila pronouncing both hamzas, or not pronouncing the second one, but in both cases 
inserting an intervening alif or without [this insertion]). God, exalted be He, says: Nay, but they are in 
doubt concerning My Remembrance, My revelation, that is, the Qur’an, for they deny the one who has 
brought it. Nay, but they have not yet tailed My chastisement, and if they were to tafte it, they would 
certainly believe the Prophet (s) in what he has brought — but then [in such a case] their belief [in the 
Prophet] would be of no benefit to them. Or do they possess the treasuries of your Lord’s mercy, the Mighty, the Vidor, the BeStower?, 
[treasuries] such as prophethood and otherwise, so that they might give it to whomever they want? Or do they possess the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them? If 
this is what they claim: Then let them ascend by the means, [of ascension] that lead to the heaven and 
bring [down] some revelation ( wahy ) and then assign it exclusively to whomever they wish (am in both 
verses represents the [rhetorical] hamza of denial). A routed ( mahzumun is an adjecftival qualification oijundun, ‘hoft’) hoSt [is all that they are].

in other words, they are [nothing but] a despicable ho,'ft, nothing more — in their denial of you — from 
among the factions ( mina’l-ahzdbi, also an adjectival qualification oijundun) in other words, [they are] 
like those hofts of factions who were in confederation against prophets before you: these were defeated 
and destroyed, and likewise We shall destroy these [people].","Sād[1]. By the Qur’an, full of reminder[2], . yet those who disbelieve are in arrogance and dissension. . How many generations have We destroyed before them, and they cried out when it was too late for deliverance. . They wonder that a warner has come to them from among themselves[3], and the disbelievers say, “This is a magician and a liar! . Has he made all gods into one God? Indeed, this is something strange!” . The leaders among them departed, saying, “Carry on as you are, and stay faithful to your gods. Indeed, there is a motive behind it[4]. . We have not heard of this in the last religion[5]. This is nothing but a fabrication. . Has the Reminder been sent down to him from among us?” Rather, they are in doubt about My Reminder[6], for they have not yet tasted My punishment. . Or do they possess the treasuries of the mercy of your Lord, the All-Mighty, the Bestower? . Or do they have the dominion of the heavens and earth and all that is between them? Then let them ascend by any means[7]. . This is only a small army[8] among several armies[9] that will soon be defeated.","[1] See footnote 2:1.

38,17,20,"God, exalted be He, says: Bear patiently what they say and remember Our servant David, the 
one of fortitude, that is to say, [the one] of fortitude in worship: he used to fast every other day and keep 
vigil for half the night, sleep for a third and then keep vigil for the [laSt] sixth. Indeed he was a penitent 
[soul], always returning to what pleases God. Truly We disposed the mountains to glorify [God] with him, with the same glorification, at 
evening, at the time of the night prayer, and at sunrise, at the time of the morning prayer, which is when 
the sun has fully risen with its light extending everywhere. And, We disposed, the birds, muflered [in flocks], gathered before him, glorifying with him; each, 
of the mountains and birds, turning to him, reverting to obedience of him by glorifying [God with him]. And We flrengthened his Kingdom, We reinforced it with guards and hosts: every night there 
thirty thousand men would be standing guard at his sanctuary; and gave him wisdom, prophethood and 
sound judgement in [all] matters, and decisive speech, [the ability to formulate] a satisfactory statement 
[for a decision] in any endeavour.","Bear with patience whatever they say, and remember Our slave David, the man of strength who constantly turned [to Allah]. . We subjected the mountains to join him in glorifying Allah in the evening and the morning, . and the birds, in their flocks; they all would echo his praise. . We strengthened his kingdom and gave him wisdom and sound judgment [and speech].",
38,21,26,"And has there come to you, O Muhammad (s) (the purpose of the interrogative [indicated by 
hal] here is to provoke curiosity and a desire to listen to what will follow) the tale of the disputants, when 
they scaled the san fluary?, David’s sanctuary, that is, his place of prayer, for they had been prohibited 
from entering by the [front] gates because of his being engaged in worship, in other words, [has it come 
to you] their tale and their account? When they entered upon David, and he was frightened by them. And they said, ‘Do not fear; 
we are, two disputants (some say that this means ‘two groups’, in order to agree with the plural person 
[of the verb dakhalu, ‘they entered’]; others say, ‘two individuals’ with the plural person actually denoting 
these two; al-khasm may refer to a one or more individuals. These two were angels who had come in the 
form of two dilutants, between whom there [was supposed to have] occurred the situation mentioned 
— [but] only hypothetically — in order to alert David, peace be upon him, to what he had done: he had 
ninety nine women but desired the woman of a man who had only her and no other. He [David] had

married her and consummated the marriage. One of us has infringed upon the [rights of the] other, so 
judge justly between us and do not transgress, [do not] be unjust, and guide us, dired us, to the right 
path’, the correct way. ‘Behold, this brother of mine, in other words, my fellow co-religionid, has ninety-nine ewes — 
here used to represent the women — while I have a single ewe; yet he said, “Entrust it to me”, in other 
words, make me in charge of it, and he overcame me in speech’, in other words, in the argument; so the 
latter conceded charge of it to him. He said, ‘He has certainly wronged you by asking for your ewe that he may add it to his sheep. 
And indeed many associates infringe upon [the rights of] one another, except such as believe and per¬ 
form righteous deeds, but few are they!’ ( ma emphasises the ‘fewness’). As the two angels were ascend¬ 
ing to the heaven one said to the other, ‘He has certainly passed judgement on himself!’ David was thus 
alerted [to his deed]. God, exalted be He, says: And David thought, in other words, he became certain, 
that We had indeed tried him, that We had caused him to fall into a trial, that is, a ted, through his love 
for that woman. So he sought forgiveness of his Lord and fell down bowing, in other words, prostrate, 
and repented. So We forgave him that and indeed he has [a Station of] nearness with Us, that is, [even] more 
good [things] in this world, and a fair return, in the Hereafter. ‘O David! We have indeed made you a vicegerent on the earth, managing the affairs of people; 
so judge juStly between people and do not follow desire, that is, the desires of the soul, that it then lead 
you aStray from the way of God, that is to say, from the proofs that indicate [the truth of] His Oneness. 
Truly those who go aStray from the way of God, in other words, from belief in God — for them there 
will be a severe chastisement because of their forgetting the Day of Reckoning’, as a result of their having 
negleded faith. For had they been certain of [the truth of] the Day of Reckoning, they would have [fird] 
been believers in this world.","Has there come to you the story of the adversaries, when they climbed the wall of his chamber? . When they entered upon David, he was frightened. They said, “Do not be afraid. We are two adversaries: one of us has wronged the other, so judge between us with fairness, and do not be unjust, and guide us to the straight path. . This is my brother[12]. He has ninety-nine ewes while I have only one. He said, ‘Give her into my charge,’ and he overpowered me in speech.” . David said, “He has certainly wronged you by demanding that your ewe be added to his flock. Indeed, many partners oppress one another, except those who believe and do righteous deeds – and how few they are.” Then David realized that We were only testing him, so he asked his Lord for forgiveness[13], fell down bowing, and turned to Him in repentance. . So We forgave that for him, and he certainly has a place of nearness to Us and a good place of return. . “O David, We have made you a ruler on earth, so judge between people with justice, and do not follow your desires lest they lead you astray from Allah’s way. Those who go astray from Allah’s way will have a severe punishment because of their forgetting the Day of Reckoning.”","[12] i.e., brother in faith, business partner, or biological brother. .

38,27,29,"And We did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in vain, frivo¬ 
lously. That, namely, the creation of what has been mentioned as being for no [particular] purpose, is the 
supposition of those who disbelieve, from among the people of Mecca. So woe — a valley [in hell-fire] 2 
— to the disbelievers from the Fire! Or shall We treat those who believe and perform righteous deeds like those who cause corrup¬ 
tion in the earth; or shall We treat the God-fearing like the profligate? This was revealed when the Mec¬ 
can disbelievers said to the believers, ‘In the Hereafter we will receive the same [reward] as that which 
you will receive’ (am, ‘or’, contains the [rhetorical] hamza of denial). A Book ( kitabun, the predicate of a missing subject, namely, hadha, ‘this is’) that We have re¬

2 There was a tendency in early Qur’anic exegesis, particularly, among popular preaching ( qussas ) to interpret many terms in the 
Qur’an as proper nouns, as opposed to whatever other type of noun they may be, verbal, common or otherwise. So way! lit. ‘woe’, 
(an exclamation of threat) is taken to be the name of a valley in Hell; see al-Qurtubi’s al-Tadhkira fi ahwal al-mawta wa-umur al- 
akhira, ed. F. A. Zamrali (Beirut: Dar al-Kitab al-‘Arabi, 1995), 11, 59ff. Similarly the term hawiya (of Q. 101:9) is taken by some to 
be a proper name (for Hell, one of seven such names) — ‘the abyss’ — or simply as a verb. There are many such examples of this 
sort of sketchy topography of Hell: see the section mentioned in Qurtubi’s work, above, where other terms are understood in this 
way ( yahmum of Q. 56:43; mawbiqan of 18:52; ghayyan of 19:59).

prancing Steeds (al-safinat, ‘horses’, is the plural of safina, which denotes [a horse] standing on three legs 
with the fourth supported on the edge of the hoof, and derives from [the verb] safana, yasfinu sufunan; 
al-jiyad is the plural of jawad, which is a ‘racer’; the meaning is that these [horses] are such that when 
they are halted they £tand £till and when they run they surpass [others] in ^eed). One thousand horses 
were delayed before him after he had performed the midday prayer, for he had wanted to use them in 
a holy struggle (jihad ) against an enemy But when the di^lay reached the nine-hundredth [horse], the 
sun set and he had not performed the afternoon prayer. So he was greatly distressed. He said, ‘Lol I have loved, I have desired, the love of [worldly] good things, that is, [of] horses, 
over the remembrance of my Lord’, that is, [over] the afternoon prayer, until it, that is, the sun, disap¬ 
peared behind the [night’s] veil, [until] it was concealed by that which veils it from sight. Bring them back to me!, that is, the horses that were displayed; and they so brought them back. 
Then he set about slashing, with his sword, [their] legs (al-siiq is the plural of saq) and necks, in other 
words, he slaughtered them and cut off their legs as an offering [of atonement] to God, exalted be He, for 
having been diStradted by them from the prayer. He gave all the meat thereof as voluntary alms and so 
God compensated him what was better and faster that these [horses], and this was the wind, which blew 
at his command as he wished. And We certainly tried Solomon: We tested him by wresting his kingdom from him, because he 
had married a woman [solely] out of his desire for her. She used to worship idols in his [own] home with¬ 
out his knowledge. Now, [control of] his kingdom lay in his ring. On one occasion, needing to withdraw 
[to relieve himself], he took it off and left it with this woman of his, whose name was al-Amina, as was his 
custom; but a jinn, [disguised] in the form of Solomon, came to her and seized it from her. And We caSl 
upon his throne a [lifeless] body, which was that [very] jinn, and he was [the one known as] $akhr — or 
it was some other [jinn]; he sat upon Solomon’s throne and so [as was the case with Solomon] the birds 
and other [creatures] devoted themselves to him [in service]. When Solomon came out [of his palace], 
having seen him [the jinn] upon his throne, he said to the people, ‘I am Solomon [not him]!’ But they 
did not recognise him. Then he repented — Solomon returned to his kingdom, many days later, after he 
had managed to acquire the ring. He wore it and sat upon his throne [again], He said, ‘My Lord! Forgive me and grant me a kingdom that shall not belong to anyone after 

me, in other words, other than me (this [use of min ba’di to mean ‘other than me’] is similar to [Q. 45:23] 
fa-man yahdih min ba’di’Llah, ‘who will guide him other than God?’). Truly You are the BeStower’. So We disposed for him the wind, which blew softly, gently, at his command wherever he intended. And the devils [also We disposed], every builder, building marvellous edifices, and diver, in the 
sea, bringing up pearls, and others too, from among them, bounded together in fetters, in shackles with their hands tied 
to their necks. And We said to him: ‘Hus is Our gift. So beStow, grant thereof to whomever you wish, or with¬ 
hold, from giving, without any reckoning’, in other words, without your being called to account for any 
of this. And indeed he has [ a Station of] nearness with Us and a fair resort — a similar [Statement] has 
already appeared [in another verse above].","And to David We gave Solomon, an excellent and faithful slave who constantly turned [to Us]. . One evening, well-trained and swift horses of noble breed were presented before him. . He then said, “I gave preference to the love of fine things over the remembrance of my Lord,” until the sun went out of sight. . [He ordered], “Bring them back to me,” and he began striking [their] shanks and necks[14]. . Indeed, We tested Solomon and cast upon his throne a body, then he turned [to Allah][15]. . He said, “My Lord, forgive me and grant me a kingdom, the like of which will never be granted to anyone after me. You are indeed the Bestower.” . So We subjected to him the wind blowing gently by his command to wherever he wished, . And [We subjected to him] the devils, all kinds of builders and divers[16], . and others bound in chains. . [We said], “This is Our gift, so give freely or withhold, without account[17].” . And he certainly has a status of nearness to Us and a good place of return.","[14] With his sword as expiation, for it might have been permissible in their law, especially if it had been for the sake of Allah such as missing prayer or the like; this is a more correct view. However, Ibn Jarīr favored the view that Solomon began to rub down their legs and necks with the hand, not by the sword. . [15] The Prophet (ﷺ) said that one night Solomon said that each one of his wives would conceive a boy who would fight for the sake of Allah. He forgot to say ‘Allah willing,’ so only one of them gave birth to a deformed, dead baby. So Solomon sought Allah’s forgiveness. [Al-Bukhāri] . [16] They dived to bring him pearls. . [17] i.e., you will not be called to account thereby."

afflided me with hardship, harm, and suffering’, pain: he attributes all this to Satan, even though all 
things are from God, to show reverence [in his call] to Him, exalted be He. And it was said to him: ‘Stamp your foot, on the ground — and he stamped [it] and a firing of

all the children of his that had died and provided him with as many [in addition to them], as a mercy, a 
grace, from us, and a reminder, an admonition, to people of pith, possessors of intellect. And [We said to him], ‘Take in your hand a bunch of twigs, or some blades of grass, and smite 
therewith, your wife — for he had sworn to smite her a hundred times on one occasion when she was 
late in coming to him — and do not break [your] oath’, by not smiting her: so he took a hundred rushes 
and smote her with them once [and that sufficed to fulfil his oath]. Truly We found him to be deadfad.

And We restored his family to him and the like of them[18] as a mercy from Us and as a reminder for people of understanding. . [We said], “Take a bunch of grass in your hand, and strike [your wife] with it, and do not break your oath[19].” We truly found him patient – an excellent and faithful slave he was. He constantly turned [to Us].","[18] When Allah granted him health, the whole family returned to him and he was granted even more children. .

Also remember Ishmael, Elisha, and Dhul-Kifl[20] – all were among the best.",[20] Scholars are of different opinions as to whether Dhul-Kifl was a prophet or only a righteous man.
38,49,54,"This is a remembrance, of them, [made] by [the mention of] fair praise [of them] here; and 
indeed for the God-fearing, who comprise them, there will truly be a fair return, in the Hereafter — Gardens of Eden (jannati ‘Adnin is either a substitution for, or an explicative supplement to, 
husna ma’dbin, ‘a fair return) whose gates are [flung] open for them; reclining therein, on couches; therein they call for plenteous fruit and drink. And with them [there] will be maidens of redrained glances, restricting their eyes to their 
Spouses, of a like age, of the same age, girls who are thirty three years of age ( atrdb is the plural of tirb). ‘This, that is mentioned, is what you are promised, by way of the unseen (there is a shift in the 
address away from the third [to the second] person]) for the Day of Reckoning. This is indeed Our provision, which will never be exhauded’, in other words, one which will 
never cease (this [laSt] sentence [ma lahu min nafadin] is a circumstantial qualifier referring to rizqund, 
‘Our provision; or it is a second predicate of inna, ‘indeed’, meaning that it will be ‘everlasting’).","This is a reminder. And the righteous will surely have a good return: . Gardens of Eternity, with gates wide open for them. . They will recline therein, calling for abundant fruit and drink. . And they will have maidens of modest gaze[21] and equal age. . This is what you are promised for the Day of Account. . Indeed, this is Our provision [for the righteous] that will never cease.",[21] Their gaze will be restricted to their mates alone.
38,55,64,"I 7 iaf, which is mentioned, will be [the reward] for the believers [is so]; but for the insolent (this 
is a new sentence) there will surely be an evil [place of] return — Hell, which they will enter — an evil reding place! This, chastisement — inferred [as so] by what follows — let them then tade it: burning hot water 
and pus (read ghasdq or ghassdq), the feStering matter excreted by the inhabitants of the Fire; and other ( dkhar may be plural or singular) kinds [of torment] resembling it, in other words,

Tafsir al-Jalalayn 

like the boiling water and pus mentioned, in pairs, of all sorts, in other words, their chastisement will 
consist of various kinds. And it will be said to them as they enter the Fire with their followers: ‘This is a horde about to 
plunge, to enter, with you, into the Fire violently — at which point those who used to be followed say: 
no welcome [is there] for them [here]!, in other words, [they will find] no comfort for them [here]. They 
will indeed roail in the Fire’. They, the followers, say, ‘Nay, but for you [there is] no welcome! You prepared this, that is, dis¬ 
belief/or us. So what an evil abode!’, for us and for you, is the Fire. They, also, say, ‘Our Lord, whoever prepared this for us, give him double his chastisement, that 
is, [give him in addition] the like of his chastisement, for his disbelief, in the Fire!’ And they, the disbelievers of Mecca, say, while they are in the Fire: ‘What is the matter with us 
that we do not see [here] men whom we used to count, in the world, among the wicked? Did we treat them mockingly? (read sukhriyyan, or sikhriyyan ), did we use to deride them 
in [the life of] the world (the [final] ya [in sikhriyya ] is attributive). In other words, are they miss¬ 
ing? Or have [our] eyes missed them [here]?’, so that we have not caught sight of them. Such [men] 
were the poor among the Muslims, like ‘Ammar [b. Yasir], Bilal [al-Habashl], Suhayb [al-Ruml] and 
Salman [al-FarisI]. Assuredly that is true: such [a scene] will necessarily take place, which is, the wrangling of the 
inhabitants of the Fire — as shown above.","This [is so]. But the transgressors will surely have the worst return: . Hell, where they will burn. What a terrible resting place! . Let them taste this: scalding water and pus, . and other similar [torments] of various kinds. . [The misleaders will say], “Here is a crowd of people being thrown in with you. They are not welcome! They will surely burn in the Fire.” . They will say, “No! You are not welcome! You brought this on us. What a terrible place to settle in!” . They will say, “Our Lord, whoever brought this on us, give him double punishment in the Fire.” . They will say, “Why do we not see those whom we considered to be among the wicked[22]? . Is it that we mistakenly made fun of them, or do our eyes fail to see them [in the Fire]?” . This is certainly true that the people of the Fire will dispute among themselves.",[22] They are alluding to the believers.
38,65,88,"Say, O Muhammad (s), to the disbelievers of Mecca: ‘I am only a Warner, to threaten [disbeliev¬ 
ers] with [punishment in] the Fire. And there is no god except God, the One, the All-Compelling, of [all] 
His creatures; Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, the Mighty, Whose way [always] 
prevails, the [ever] Forgiving’, of His friends. Say, to them: ‘It is a tremendous tiding from which you are turning away, namely, the Qur’an, of which I have informed you and in 
which I have brought you what can only be known by revelation, and that is God’s saying: I had no knowledge of the High Council, that is to say, [of] the angels, when they disputed, in 
the matter of Adam, when God, exalted be He, said [to them]: ‘I am appointing on earth a vicegerent’, to 
the end [of the verse, Q. 2:30]. All that is revealed to me is that I amjuSt a plain Warner’, one whose warning is clear. Mention, when your Lord said to the angels, ‘Indeed I am about to create a human being out of 
clay, and this was Adam. So when I have proportioned him, completed him, and breathed in him, [when I have] caused 
to flow [therein], My Spirit, so that he becomes a living [being] — the addition of ‘the .■fj^irit’ to Adam is 
an honour for him; the ‘Spirit’ is a subtle body that gives life to a human being by permeating him — then 
fall down in prostration before him!’ — a prostration of salutation [that is actually] a bow. Thereat the angels prostrated, all of them together (there are two emphases here [kulluhum 
and ajma’un ]); except Iblis, the father of the jinn, who was among the [audience of] angels; he was disdainful 
and he was one of the disbelievers, according to God’s knowledge, exalted be He.

Sura Sad Hesaid, ‘Olblisi What prevents you from prostrating before that which I have created with My 
own hands?, in other words, whose creation I [Myself] have undertaken. This [in itself] is an honour 
for Adam, as God has [Himself] undertaken the [unmediated] creation of all creatures. Are you being 
arrogant, now, in refraining from prostrating (an interrogative meant as a rebuke); or are you of the ex¬ 
alted?’, of the proud, and have therefore disdained to prostrate yourself, because you are one of them? He said, ‘I am better than him. You created me from fire and You created him from clay’. He said, ‘Then begone hence, that is, from Paradise — or, it is said, [begone] from the heavens — 
for you are indeed accursed, outcast. And indeed My curse shall be on you until the Day of Judgement’, [the Day] of Requital. He said, ‘My Lord, then reprieve me until the day when they, mankind, will be raised’. He said, ‘Then you will indeed be among the reprieved until the day of the known time’, the time of the first Blast. He said, ‘Now, by Your might, I shall surely pervert them all, except those servants of Yours among them who will be saved’, namely, the believers. He said, ‘So the truth is — and the truth I [always] Speak (read both [words] in the accusative 
[ fa’l-haqqa wa’l-haqqa ]; or with the firSt in the nominative and the second in the accusative because of 
the verb [aqulu, ‘I SJieak’] that follows. As for reading the firSt one in the accusative, this would be on 
account of the mentioned verb [qala, ‘he said’]; but it is also said to be on account of its being a verbal 
noun, the sense being uhiqqu l-haqqa, ‘I establish the truth’; or [it is in the accusative by implication] if 
the particle for the oath [fa] is removed. It [the fir£t haqq] could also be in the nominative because of its 
being the subject of a missing predicate, as in fa’l-haqqu minni, ‘truth [comes] from Me’. It is also said 
that [the sentence means] fa’l-haqqu qasami, ‘the truth is [this] oath from Me’, the re£j)onse to which is 
the following [la-amla’anna ...]) — I shall assuredly fill Hell with you, by way of [filling it with] your progeny, and with whoever of 
them follows you, that is, of mankind, all together’. Say: ‘I do not ask of you, in return for this, for delivering the Message [to you], any reward, any 
fee; nor am I an impoStor, so as to make up the Qur’an myself. It is only, in other words, the Qur’an is only, a reminder, an admonition, for all worlds, [those 
of] humans, jinn and [other] rational beings, [but] excluding the angels. And you will assuredly come to know, O disbelievers of Mecca, its tiding, the news of its truth, 
in [due] time’, that is to say, on the Day of Resurrection film, ‘knowing’, is here being used in the sense 
of ‘urf ‘experience’; the prefixed lam [in la-ta’lamunna, ‘you will assuredly know’] is for an implicit oath, 
in other words [what is meant is] wa’Llahi [la-ta’lamunna, ‘By God you will assuredly know’]).

Then the angels fell down in prostration all together, . except Iblīs, who was arrogant and became one of the disbelievers[27]. .

He said, “I am better than him: You created me from fire and created him from clay.” .

39,1,5,"The revelation of the Book, the Qur’an ( tanzilu’l-kitabi , the subject) is from God ( mina’Llahi , its 
predicate) the Mighty, in His kingdom, the Wise, in His handiwork. Indeed We have revealed to you, O Muhammad (s), the Book with the truth ( bi’l-haqqi is seman¬ 
tically connected to anzalnd, ‘We have revealed’); so worship God, devoting your religion purely to Him, 
[pure] of any idolatry, in other words, affirming His Oneness. Surely to God belongs pure religion, none other than Him being deserving of it. And those who 
take besides Him, the idols [as], patrons: and they are the disbelievers of Mecca — they say: ‘We only 
worship them so that they may bring us near to God’ ( zulfa, a verbal noun, with the sense of taqriban, 
‘for the sake of nearness’). God will indeed judge between them, and the Muslims, concerning that about 
which they differ, of religion, and so admit the believers into Paradise, and the disbelievers into the Fire. 
Truly God does not guide one who is a liar, attributing a child to Him, a disbeliever, worshipping other 
than God. Had God wanted to take a son — as they allege [that He has], 'The Compassionate One has taken 
[ to Himself] a son [Q. 19:88], He could have chosen from what He has created whatever He willed, and 
taken it as a child, instead of the angels whom they claim to be God’s daughters, or [their claim] that ‘Ezra 
is the son of God’, or that ‘Jesus is the son of God’ [cf. Q. 9:30]. Glory be to Him, in exaltation of Him as 
being above that He should take a child. He is God, the One, the All-Compelling, over all His creatures. He created the heavens and the earth with the truth ( bi’l-haqqi is semantically connected to kha- 
laqa, ‘He created’). He turns the night into day, so that it grows, and turns the day into night, so that it 
grows, and He has disposed the sun and the moon, each running, in its course, for an appointed term, 
until the Day of Resurrection. Verily it is He Who is the Mighty, Whose way [always] prevails, Requiter 
of His enemies, the [ever] Forgiving, of His friends.","The revelation of this Book is from Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. . Indeed, We have sent down to you [O Prophet] the Book with the truth, so worship Allah with sincere devotion to Him. . Indeed, sincere devotion is due to Allah alone[1]. As for those who take others as guardians besides Him, [saying], “We only worship them so that they may bring us closer to Allah.” Allah will judge between them[2] concerning that over which they differ. Allah does not guide anyone who is a liar and a persistent disbeliever. . If Allah had willed to take for Himself a son, He could have chosen whatever He wished from among what He creates. Glory be to Him. He is Allah, the One, the Subjugator. . He created the heavens and earth for a true purpose. He wraps the night over the day and wraps the day over the night. He has subjected the sun and the moon, each running its course for an appointed term. Indeed, He is the All-Mighty, Most Forgiving.","[1] i.e., He only accepts sincere worship and obedience.
 [2] i.e., between those who were devoted to Allah alone and those who associated partners with Him."
39,6,8,"He created you from a single sold, namely, Adam, then made from it its mate. Eve; and He sent 
down for you of the cattle, [of] camels, cows, small cattle, sheep and goats, eight kinds, of each kind a 
male and a female — as He makes clear in siirat al-Anam [Q. 6:i43f.]. He creates you in your moth¬ 
ers’ wombs, creation after creation, that is to say, as a .CJierm-drop, then a blood clot, then a foetus, in a 
threefold darkness, that is, the darkness of the belly, that of the womb and that of the placenta. That is 
God, your Lord. To Him belongs [all] sovereignty. There is no god except Him. Why then are you being 
turned away?, from worshipping Him to worshipping [things] other than Him? 

[ 39 : 7 ] If you are ungrateful, indeed God is Independent of you, though He does not approve of in¬ 
gratitude for His servants, even if He should will it [to manifest itself] in some of them. And if you 
give thanks, to God and thus become believers. He will approve of it (read yardah, or yardahu, either 
lengthening the vowel or not), that is, [of such] thankfulness, for you. And no burdened soul shall bear 
the burden of another [soul], in other words, it will not bear [the responsibility for] it. Then to your Lord 
will be your return, whereat He will inform you of what you used to do. Indeed He is Knower of what 
is in the breads, of what is in the hearts [of men].  And when didress befalls a person, that is, the disbeliever, he supplicates his Lord, he implores, 
turning, returning, to Him penitently. Then, when He bedows on him a grace from Himself, he forgets, 
he negleCts, Him Whom he had supplicated, implored, before, namely, God (in other words md func¬ 
tions as min, ‘whom’) and sets up equals, associates, with God, that he may lead [others] adray (read 
li-yadilla or li-yudilla) from His way — [from] the religion of Islam. Say: ‘Revel in your ingratitude

for a while — for the remainder of your term [of life]. You shall indeed be among the inhabitants of 
the Fire’.","He created you from a single soul[3], then He made from it its mate[4], and He created for you eight types of livestock[5]. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers [in stages], creation after creation, in three layers of darkness[6]. Such is Allah, your Lord. To Him belongs the dominion; none has the right to be worshiped except Him. So how are you averted? . If you disbelieve, then Allah is in no need of you, but He does not approve of disbelief for His slaves. If you are grateful, He approves that for you. No bearer of burden can bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you of what you used to do. He is All-Knowing of what is in the hearts. . When adversity befalls man, he calls upon his Lord, turning to Him in repentance. Then when his Lord bestows His favor upon him, he forgets the adversity for which he was calling upon Him before, and sets up rivals to Allah, to mislead others from His way. Say [O Prophet], “Enjoy your disbelief for a little while; you will be one of the people of the Fire.”","[3] i.e., Adam. [4] i.e., Eve. [5] The eight types of livestock: (four males and females): a pair of sheep, a pair of goats, a pair of camels, and a pair of oxen. See 6:143-144.

ence, in the watches of the night, [during] its hours, prostrating and Standing, in prayer, apprehensive 
of the [eventuality of the] Hereafter, in other words, fearing its chastisement, and hoping for the 
mercy, the Paradise, of his Lord ... ?, like one who is disobedient through disbelief or otherwise? (a 
variant reading has am-man, pronouncing the hamza, so that am has the sense of bal, rather). Say: 
‘Are those who know equal with those who do not know?’, in other words, they are not equal, juSt as 
the person of knowledge is not equal to the ignorant one. Only people of pith, possessors of intellect, 
remember, [only they] are admonished. Say: ‘O servants of Mine who believe! Fear your Lord, that is to say, [fear] His chastisement, 
by being obedient to Him. For those who are virtuous in this world, through obedience, there will be 
good, and that is Paradise, and God’s earth is vail, so emigrate throughout it, away from the [company 
of] disbelievers and the sight of indecencies. Truly the Steadfast, in [their] obedience [of God] and in 
[enduring] whatever [hardship] they may be teSted with, will be paid their reward infidl without any 
reckoning’, without any measure or any scales [to work it out].","[Is he better] or the one who constantly worships during the night, prostrating and standing, fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord? Say, “Are those who know equal to those who do not know?” It is only the people of understanding who will take heed. . Say[7], “O My slaves who believe, fear your Lord. Those who do good in this world will have a good return, and Allah’s earth is spacious. Those who observe patience will be given their reward without measure.”",[7] Allah instructed the Prophet (ﷺ) to say on behalf of Him.
39,11,20,"Say: ‘Indeed I have been commanded to worship God devoting [my] religion purely to Him, 
[pure] of any idolatry, and I have been commanded to be the firSt of those who submit’, from this community. Say: ‘Indeed, should I disobey my Lord, I fear the chastisement of a tremendous day’. Say: ‘God [alone] I worship, devoting [my] religion purely to Him, [pure] of any idolatry. So worship whatever you wish besides Him’, other than Him — herein is a threat for them as 
well as a declaration [of the fadt] that they do not worship God, exalted be He. Say: ‘Indeed the losers 
are those who [ will] have toil their souls and their families on the Day of Resurrection, by condemning 
their souls to abide [forever] in the Fire, and their failure to attaining [the bliss promised among] the 
black-eyed virgins who would have been prepared for them in Paradise had they been believers. Truly 
that is the manifest loss!’ Above them they will have canopies, layers, of fire, and beneath them [they will have [similar] 
canopies, of fire. That is what God frightens His servants with, that is, the believing ones, that they may 
have fear of Him — this [sense of the verse] is suggested by [what follows]), “So, O servants of Mine, 
fear Me!”’ As for those who Steer clear of the worship of false deities, graven images, and turn penitently, 
apply themselves, to God, there are good tidings for them, of Paradise. So give [such] good tidings to 
My servants, who listen to the words [of God] and follow the beSt [sense] of it, which is that which contains 
[the means to] righteousness for them. Those, they are the ones whom God has guided; and those, they

will surely fill Hell [with jinn and mankind together] [Q. 11:119]; Will you deliver, bring out, one who is 
in the Fire? (this is the response to the conditional clause, in which the overt qualification [man fi’l-nar, 
‘one who is in the Fire’] replaces the pronominalisation [a-fa-man, ‘he ... whom’]; the hamza [in a-fa- 
anta, ‘will you’] is for rejection, in other words [the sense is that] you will not be able to guide him and 
therefore deliver him from the Fire).

that follows.

abodes with [other] lofty abodes built above them, with rivers flowing beneath them, that is, beneath 
[both] the upper and the lower abodes — a promise of God (wada’Llahi, in the accusative because of an 
implied verb governing it). God does not fail the try ft, [He does not break] His promise.","Say, “I have been commanded to worship Allah, with sincere devotion to Him, . and I have been commanded to be the first of those who submit to Allah.” .

39,21,26,"Have you not seen, realised, that God sends down water from the heaven, then conducts it as 
fp rings, making it enter points of brings, in the ground? Then with it He brings forth crops of diverse 
hues. Then they wither, they become dried-out, and you see them, for example, after having been 
green, turning yellow. Then He turns them into chaff. Tridy in that there is a reminder for people of 
pith, possessors of intellect, by which they may be reminded, for it is an indication of God’s Oneness 
and His power. Is he whose bread God has opened to Islam, and becomes guided, so that he follows a light from 
his Lord...?, like he whose heart He has sealed [with disbelief] ? 2 — this [understanding of the ellipsis] is 
indicated by [what follows]. So woe — an expression indicating ‘chastisement’ — to those whose hearts 
have been hardened againd the remembrance of God, that is, [hardened] againSt the acceptance of the 
Qur’an. Such are in manifest error. God has revealed the bed of discourses, a Book (kitaban, substitutes for ahsana, ‘the beSt’) 
namely, a Qur’an, consimilar, in other words, some of its parts are similar to others in terms of [their] 
arrangement and otherwise, in coupled phrases — [a Book] in which the Promise [of reward] is coupled

of whose Threat shiver, the skins of those who fear their Lord; then their skins and their hearts soften

is God’s guidance, by which He guides whomever He will, of His servants; and whomever God leads 
adray,for him there is no guide. Is he who will be fending off, [is he] who will encounter, with his face the awfid chadisement on 
the Day of Resurrection ...?, that is, the in oft severe [chastisement], when he is flung into the Fire with 
his hands bound to his neck in fetters, [is he] like one who will be secure from it by entering Paradise? 
And it will be said to the wrongdoers, namely, the disbelievers of Mecca: ‘Tade [now] what you used to 
earn’, that is, [tafte] the requital for it. Those who were before them denied, their messengers with regard to the coming of the chastise¬ 
ment; and so the chadisement came on them whence they were not aware, in a way that would never 
have occurred to them. So God made them tade disgrace, abasement and humiliation, in the way of being transformed 
[into swine] and being killed and otherwise, in the life of this world. And the chadisement of the Hereaf¬ 
ter will surely be greater, had they, that is, the deniers, known, [the nature of] the chastisement thereof, 
they would not have denied.","Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky and makes it flow as springs in the earth, then He brings forth thereby crops of various colors; then they whither and you see them turn yellow; then He causes them to crumble? Indeed, there is a reminder in this for people of understanding. . Is one whose heart Allah has opened to Islam, so he is enlightened by his Lord [like a disbeliever]? Woe to those whose hearts are hardened upon hearing the reminder of Allah; it is they who are clearly misguided. . Allah has sent down the best message – a consistent Book of repeated lessons – causing the skins of those who fear their Lord to shiver, and then their skins and their hearts soften at the remembrance of Allah. This is the guidance of Allah by which He guides whom He wills. But whoever Allah causes to stray, there is none to guide him. . Is one who will shield himself from the terrible punishment with his face[11] on the Day of Resurrection [like someone in Paradise]? And it will be said to the wrongdoers: “Taste what you used to earn.” . Those who came before them also disbelieved, so the punishment came upon them from where they could not imagine. .

and a man belonging exclusively to one man. Are the two equal in comparison? (mathalan, for Speci¬

slave of one] is the similitude of the one who believes in the One God. Praise be to God!, alone. Nay, but 
mod of them, that is, the people of Mecca, do not know, the chastisement in which they will end up and 
so they associate others with God. You — an address to the Prophet (s) — will indeed die, and they [too] will indeed die, and so 
there is no satisfaction to be gained from [another’s] death: this was revealed because they kept waiting 
for the Prophet (s) to die. Then you will indeed, O mankind, concerning the injustices you committed towards one an¬ 
other, be contending before your Lord on the Day of Resurrection.","Indeed, We have presented for mankind all kinds of examples in this Qur’an, so that they may take heed – . an Arabic Qur’an, free of flaws and contradictions, so that they may be conscious of Allah. . Allah makes a comparison of a slave owned by several quarrelsome masters, and a slave owned by only one master. Are they equal in comparison? All praise be to Allah. But most of them do not know. . You [O Prophet] will surely die, and they too will die; . then on the Day of Resurrection, you will dispute with one another before your Lord.",
39,32,37,"So who is — in other words, none is — a greater wrongdoer than he who imputes falsehood to 
God, by ascribing partners and child to Him, and [who] denies the truth, namely, the Qur’an, when it 
reaches him? Is there not a [fitting] abode in Hell for the disbelievers? Indeed, there is. And he who brings the truth — and that is the Prophet (5) — and [those] who confirm it, namely, 
the believers (here alladhi, ‘he who’, has the significance of alladhina, ‘those who’), those, they are the 
ones who guard themselves, againSt idolatry. They shall have whatever they wish with their Lord. That is the reward of those who are virtu¬ 
ous, to their own souls through their [acceptance of] faith; 

[ 39 : 35 ] so that God may absolve them of the word of what they did, and pay them their reward by the 
bed of what they used to do ( aswa’a and ahsana mean [simply] al-sayyi’, ‘bad’, and al-hasan, ‘good’).  Does God not suffice [as defender of] His servant?, the Prophet? Indeed, He does. Yet they 
would frighten you — the address is for him (s) — of those besides Him, namely, the idols, [by telling 
him] that these [idols] might kill him or render him insane. And whomever God leads adray, for him 
there is no guide. 

[ 39 : 37 ] But whomever God guides, there is no one [able] to lead him adray. Is not God Mighty, One 
Whose way [always] prevails, a Lord of Retribution?, against His enemies? Indeed, He is. ","Who is then more unjust than he who tells lies about Allah and rejects the truth when it comes to him? Is there no abode for the disbelievers in Hell? . But the one who came with the truth [i.e., the prophet] and [those who] believed in it, it is they who are the righteous. . They will have with their Lord whatever they wish for. Such is the reward of those who do good. . And Allah will absolve them of their worst deeds and reward them according to the best of what they used to do. . Is Allah not sufficient for His slave? Yet they frighten you with those [whom they worship] besides Him. Whoever Allah causes to stray, there is none to guide him. . And whoever Allah guides, none can lead him astray. Is not Allah All-Mighty, Capable of Retribution?",

they will surely say, ‘God.’ Say: ‘Have you considered then those on whom you call, [those whom] you 
worship, besides God, namely, the idols, if God should desire some harm to befall me, would they [be 
able to] remove the harm imposed by Him? No! Or if He should desire some mercy for me, would they 
[be able to] withhold His mercy?’ No! (a variant reading for the two clauses [kashifatun durrahu and 
mumsikdtun rahmatahu ] has the genitive construction [kashifatu durrihi and mumsikdtu rahmatihi ). 
Say: ‘God is sufficient for me. In Him do [all] the trading put their trud’. Say: ‘O my people! Ad according to your situation, [according to] your circumstances, I [too]

chadisement’, an everlasting one, namely, the chastisement of the Fire. Indeed God [then] disgraced 
them at Badr.","If you ask them who created the heavens and earth, they will surely say, “Allah.” Say, “Then tell me about those whom you supplicate besides Allah; if Allah wills to harm me, can they remove His harm? Or if He wills mercy for me, can they withhold His mercy?” Say, “Allah is sufficient for me; in Him alone do the reliant put their trust.” . Say, “O my people, carry on as you are, and so will I. You will come to know . who will receive a humiliating punishment, and upon whom will descend an everlasting punishment.”",

you are not [meant to be] a guardian over them, and so compel them to [embrace] guidance.","We have sent down to you the Book with the truth for all mankind.

beStow on him a grace from Us, he says, ‘I was given it merely by force of knowledge’, from God that I 
was deserving of it. Nay, but it, this saying, is a trial, a teSt by which servants are teSted. But moSt of them 
do not know, that such beStowal [of grace] is a way of drawing [them] on and a teSt [of their faith]. Already the same was said by those who were before them, of communities, such as Korah 
and those of his people who were content with such [a saying]. But what they used to earn did not 
avail them. So the evils of what they earned smote them, that is, the requital thereof [smote them]. And the 
evildoers among these, namely, [among] Quraysh, shall also be smitten by the evils of what they earned, 
and they will not be able to thwart it: [they will not] elude Our chastisement — thus they were made to 
suffer seven years of drought and [only] afterwards were they enriched [with provision from God]. Do they not know that God extends His provision, [that He] makes it abundant, for whomever 
He will, as a teSt, and restricts [it]?, for whomever He will, as a trial? Tndy in that there are signs for a 
people who believe, in Him.

Therefore the evil consequences of their deeds overtook them, and the wrongdoers among these [pagans] will be overtaken by the evil consequences of their deeds, and they will have no escape[14]. .

Sura al-Zumar And follow the bed of what has been revealed to you from your Lord — namely, the Qur’an —

it has [actually] come; so apply yourselves to this, before any soul should say, ‘Alas for me ( yd hasratd is actually yd 
hasrati, meaning ‘O regret of mine’) for what I have neglected of my duty to God, in other words, [of] 
obedience to Him. Indeed ( wa-in: in is softened in place of the hardened form, in other words [under¬

guided, I would have been among those who have feared’. His chastisement; or [before] that it should say, when it sees the chastisement, ‘If only there had been a second 
chance, a return to this world, I woidd be among the virtuous’, the believers. It is then said to him by 
God: 

[ 39 : 59 ] Yes indeed! My signs came to you, the Qur’an — which is the means to guidance — but you de¬ 
nied them and were arrogant, you disdained to believe in them, and you were among the disbelievers’. ","Say [Allah says], “O My slaves who have transgressed against themselves, do not despair of Allah’s mercy, for indeed Allah forgives all sins[15]. He is indeed the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. . Turn to your Lord [in repentance] and submit to Him before the punishment comes upon you, for then you will not be helped. . Follow the best of what has been sent down to you all from your Lord, before the punishment comes upon you by surprise while you are unaware, . lest someone should say[16], “Woe to me for neglecting my duties towards Allah and for being among those who mocked [the truth]”; . or says, “If only Allah had guided me, I would have been among the righteous”; . or says, upon seeing the punishment, “If only I had another chance[17], I could be among those who do good.” . [Allah will say,] “No indeed! My verses had already come to you, but you rejected them and acted arrogantly, and you were among the disbelievers.”","[15] It is for those who repent and correct themselves, no matter how big the sins are. The only unforgivable sin in Islam is dying in disbelief in Allah or associating others with Him. See 4:48. The Prophet (ﷺ) reports that Allah Almighty says, ""O children of Adam! As long as you call upon Me, putting your hope in Me, I will forgive you for what you have done, and I will not mind. O children of Adam! If your sins were to reach the clouds of the sky and then you sought My forgiveness, I would forgive you. O children of Adam! If you were to come to Me with sins filling the whole world and then you came to Me without associating partners with Me, I would certainly match your sins with forgiveness."" [At-Tirmidhi] .

account of the place they have won in Paradise, by placing them in it. No evil will touch them, nor will 
they grieve. God is the Creator of all things and He is Guardian over all things, disposing of them as He will. To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth, in other words, the keys to their Storehous¬

nuns assimilated [ta’murunni] or separated [ta’murunani]). And certainly it has been revealed to you and to those before you [that], by God!, if you associ¬

surely be among the losers’. Rather, worship God, alone, and be among the thankful, of His beStowal of graces on you. And they do not eCleem God as He should be esteemed, they do not understand His true nature, 
or [it means] that they do not exalt Him with the exaltation truly worthy of Him, when they associate 
others with Him. And the entire earth (jami’an is a circumstantial qualifier) in other words, the seven 
[earths], will be in His graCp, in other words, it shall be graSJjed by Him, meaning [that it will be] in His

Our Lord, admit them to the Gardens of Eternity which You have promised them, and the righteous from among their parents, their spouses and their offspring. Indeed, it is You Who are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. . And protect them from the evil consequences [of their sins]. For whoever You protect from the evil consequences on that Day, You have surely bestowed mercy upon him. That is the supreme triumph.”",
40,10,12,"Indeed to those who disbelieve it will be proclaimed [to them], from the part of the angels,

greater than your loathing of yourselves, as you were called, [during life] in this world, to faith but 
you used to disbelieve’. 


Tafsir al-Jalalayn They will say, ‘Our Lord, You have caused us to die twice, two deaths, and You have given us life 
twice — for they were lifeless drops of semen, then they were given life, then made to die, then brought 
back to life for the Resurrection. We [now] confess our sins, in having disbelieved in the Resurrection. Is 
there then any way to go out?’, out of the Fire and return to the world to be obedient to our Lord? The 
answer given to them will be: No! I 7 iaf, namely, the chastisement which you find yourselves in, is because, during [the life of] 
this world, when God was invoked alone, you would disbelieve, in His Oneness; but if partners were 
ascribed to Hint, you would believe, you would accept such idolatry. So the judgement, to chastise you, 
belongs to God, the Exalted, above His creation, the Great, the Tremendous.","Those who disbelieve will be addressed[2], “Allah’s abhorrence of you when you were called to believe but you disbelieved was greater than your abhorrence of yourselves [Today].” . They will say, “Our Lord, You have caused us to die twice[3] and brought us to life twice. Now we acknowledge our sins; is there any way out?” . [They will be told], “This is because when Allah was invoked alone, you disbelieved, but when others were associated with Him, you believed. The judgment belongs to Allah, the Most High, the All-Great.”","[2] On the Day of Judgment. . [3] You created us from nothing, then gave us life in the wombs of our mothers, then caused us to die, and finally resurrected us after our death. See 2:28."
40,13,20,"He it is Who shows you His signs, the proofs of His Oneness, and sends down from the heaven 
for you provision, by way of rain. Yet no one remembers, [no one] is admonished, except him who re¬ 
turns penitently, [who] recants idolatry. So supplicate God, worship Him, devoting [your] religion purely to Him, [free] from any idola¬ 
try, however much the disbelievers be averse, to its being free of such [idolatry]. Exalter of ranks, [either means] that God is One Whose attributes are majestic — or [it means] 
the raiser of the ranks of believers in Paradise — Lord of the Throne, in other words, the Creator thereof, 
He cafts the Spirit, the Revelation, of His command, that is, [of] His words, upon whomever He will of 
His servants, that he, the one upon whom it is caSt, may warn them of, [that he may] make people fear, 
the Day of Encounter (read yawma’l-taldqi, omitting the [final long] ya, or yawma’l-taldqi), that is to say, 
the Day of Resurrection, [so called] because thereat the inhabitants of the heavens will encounter those 
of the earth, and the worshipper [will encounter] the one whom he worshipped, and the wrongdoer [will 
encounter] the person whom he wronged; the day when they will emerge, [the day] they will exit from their graves; nothing about them 
will be hidden from God. ‘To whom does Sovereignty belong today?’ — God, exalted be He, asks this 
and Himself responds — ‘To God, the One, the All-compelling!’, over His creatures. Today every soul shall be requited for what it has earned; there will be no injustice today. In¬ 
deed God is swift at reckoning’, reckoning with all of creation in the SJiace of half a day of the days of this 
world — a hadith states this. And warn them of the Impending Day, namely, the Day of Resurrection ( al-azifa, as in azifa al- 
rahilu, ‘departure is very near’) when the hearts will, rising up in fear, reach the throats, choking with 
anguish, filled with [suppressed] anxiety ( kdzimina is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-qulubu, 
‘the hearts’, which is qualified by the [acftive animate participle] plural [ kdzimina ] and referred to as 
though they were the very individuals themselves). The evildoers will not have any intimate [friend], 
[any] sympathiser, nor any intercessor who might be heeded — the adjectival qualification [‘who might 
be heeded’] has no [literal] significance, for they do not have intercessors in the firSt place: So [now] we 
have no intercessors ... [Q. 26:100]. The firSt part, however, may [be said to] have significance if [under¬ 
stand] on the basis of their claim to have intercessors, and so, in other words, even if — hypothetically 
Sneaking — they [their intercessors] did intercede for them, they would not be heeded. He, namely, God, knows the treachery of the eyes, when it Steals a glance at what is prohibited 
[for it to look at], and what the breafts hide — [what] the hearts [hide]. And God decrees with truth, while those on whom they call, whom they worship, that is, the dis¬ 
believers of Mecca (read yad’una, ‘they call’, or tad'una, ‘you call’) besides Him — and these are the idols 
— do not decree by any means [at all]: so how can they be God’s associates? Truly God is the Hearer, of 
their sayings, the Seer, of their actions.","It is He Who shows you His signs and sends down for you provision from the sky, but none will take heed except those who turn to Him. . So call upon Allah with sincere devotion to Him, even if the disbelievers may dislike it. . He is Exalted in Rank, Lord of the Throne. He sends down the revelation by His command to whom He wills of His slaves, in order to warn of the Day of Meeting, . the Day when they will be brought forth, nothing about them will be hidden from Allah. [He will say], “To whom does the dominion belong this Day[4]? To Allah, the One, the Subjugator! . Today every soul will be recompensed for what it has earned; no injustice Today! Allah is swift in reckoning.” . Warn them of the approaching Day, when hearts will be at the throats, full of distress. The wrongdoers will have no close friend or intercessor whose word may be heeded. . He knows the sneaky glances of the eyes and what the hearts conceal. . Allah judges with justice, whereas those whom they invoke besides Him cannot judge at all. Indeed, it is Allah Who is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.","[4] The Prophet (ﷺ) said that everyone and everything that has ever existed will die on that Day, except for Allah, the Eternal. He will then ask, “To who belongs all authority this Day? Where are the kings of the world? I am the King.” Since no one will be there to answer, Allah will answer Himself, “To Allah, the One, the Supreme!” [Sahih Muslim]."

him, and Tpare, keep alive, their women’. But the guile of the disbelievers is ever in error, in perdition. And Pharaoh said, ‘Let me slay Moses — for they used to restrain him from slaying him — and 
let him call to his Lord, to defend him againSt me. Indeed I fear that he may change your religion, 
[involving] your worship of me, so that you will then follow him [in his religion], or that he may cause

40,28,33,"Then said a believing man from among Pharaoh’s folk — this is said to have been his paternal 
cousin — who had concealed his faith, ‘Will you slay a man for saying, “My Lord is God”, even though 
he has [also] brought you clear signs, manifest miracles, from your Lord? If he is lying, then his men¬ 
dacity will be to his own detriment, that is, the harm resulting from his mendacity [will be to his own 
detriment]; but if he is truthful, then there will befall you some of that with which he is threatening you, 
in the way of chastisement, soon. Truly God does not guide one who is a prodigal, an idolater, a liar. O my people! Today the kingdom is yours: [you are] dominant, prevailing ( zdhirina, a circum¬ 
stantial qualifier) in the land, the land of Egypt. But who will help us against the might of God, [againSt] 
His chastisement, if you [resolve to] slay His friends, should it reach us?’ In other words, we would have

you what I suggeSt to myself, and that is, to kill Moses [would be beSt]; and I am only guiding you to the 
path ofreditude’, [to] the correcft way. Then said he who believed, ‘O my people! Truly I fear for you [a day] like the day of the factions,

the [final long] ya, or retaining it thus: yawma’l-tanadi) that is to say, the Day of Resurrection, in which 
repeated calls are made by those meriting Paradise to those meriting the Fire and vice versa, as well as

you continued to be in doubt concerning what he had brought you until, when he died, you said, with¬ 
out any evidence [to support such a claim]: “God will never send any messenger after him” — in other 
words, you will never cease to disbelieve in Joseph and others [that may come after him]. So, that is, juft: 
as you have been led aftray, God leads aStray one who is a prodigal, an idolater, a skeptic’, a doubter of 
that which the clear signs have certified. Those who dispute the signs of God, His miracles (alladhina yujadilunafi ayati’Llahi, the subjedt) 
without any warrant, any evidence, that has come to them — greatly hatefid [is that], diluting of 
theirs ( kabura, the predicate of the subjedt) in the sight of God and in the sight of those who believe. So, 
juft: as they have been led aftray, God sets a seal, of misguidance, on the heart of every arrogant tyrant 
(read qalbin, ‘the heart of’, with nunation, or without, qalbi). As the heart grows arrogant, so does the 
individual and vice versa (kulli, in both readings, is meant to indicate the totality of the misguidance of 
such hearts, not the totality of the hearts).","Joseph came to you[9] before with clear proofs, but you never ceased to doubt what he brought you. Then when he died, you said, ‘Allah will never send a messenger after him.’ This is how Allah causes to stray anyone who transgresses and is given to much doubting, . those who argue against Allah’s signs with no proof given to them. How loathsome is that to Allah and to those who believe!

righteously, whether male or female, and is a believer — such shall be admitted into Paradise (read 
[passive] yudkhaluna, or the opposite [adtive yadkhuluna, ‘they shall enter’) wherein they will be pro¬

Whoever does an evil deed will only be recompensed with the like thereof, but whoever does a righteous deed, whether male or female, and he is a believer – it is they who will enter Paradise, wherein they will be given provision without measure. . O my people, how is it that I call you to salvation while you call me to the Fire? . You call me to disbelieve in Allah and associate with Him what I have no knowledge of, while I call you to the All-Mighty, the Most Forgiving. . There is no doubt that those [gods] to whom you call me are not worthy of calling upon, neither in this world nor in the Hereafter. Our return is to Allah, and it is the transgressors who are the people of the Fire. . You will remember what I am telling you, and I entrust my affairs to Allah.

Mecca, do not know, this, and so they are like the blind, whereas those who know it are like those who 
have sight. And the blind one and the seer are not equal; nor are [they equal] those who believe and per¬ 
form righteous deeds — such a person being the virtuous one — and the evildoer ( wa-lal-musi’u : Id here 
is extra). Little do they reflect, [little] are they admonished (read yatadhakkanina, or [second person 
plural] tatadhakkaruna, ‘do you refled), in other words, their refledions are very few.","We gave Moses guidance, and made the Children of Israel inherit the Scripture, . as a guide and a reminder to people of understanding. . So be patient, for Allah’s promise is true. Seek forgiveness for your sin[13], and glorify your Lord with His praise evening and morning. . Those who argue against the verses of Allah without any proof given to them, there is nothing in their hearts but a quest for dominance which they will never attain. So seek refuge with Allah, for He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. . The creation of the heavens and earth is far greater than the creation of mankind, but most people do not know. . The blind and the seeing are not equal, nor are those who believe and do righteous deeds [equal] to those who do evil. Little do you take heed!","[13] Like all other prophets and messengers, Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) was infallible of sins, especially concerning what they conveyed from Allah. However, flaws or mistakes could happen with prophets, like all other human beings. The examples include the Prophet’s response to the blind man (80:1-10); Jonah’s departure from his people without Allah’s permission (21:87-88); and David’s suspicion and fear of the two men who scaled the wall of his chamber (38:21-25). If the Prophet (ﷺ) himself is urged to seek Allah’s forgiveness, then the believers are far more in need of seeking Allah’s forgiveness."

the age of thirty to forty — then that you may become aged (read shuyukhan or shiyukhan) — though 
there are some of you who die earlier, that is, before coming of age or becoming aged. He does this to 
you so that you may live [on], and that you may complete an appointed term, a defined length of time, 
that perhaps you might understand, the proofs of [His] Oneness and thus become believers. He it is Who gives life and brings death. So when He decides upon a matter, [when] He wants 
to bring something into existence, He only says to it ‘Bel’ and it is (read fa-yakunu, or fa-yakuna [in the 
subjunctive] on account of an implied [preceding] an). In other words, it comes into existence after He 
has willed it, that which is signified by the said words.","It is He Who created you from dust[15], then from a sperm drop[16], then from a clinging clot[17]. Then He brings you out as an infant, so that you may reach your age of full strength, then you become old, even though some of you may die earlier – and so that you may reach an appointed term[18], and so that you may understand. . It is He Who gives life and causes death. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, “Be,” and it is.","[15] i.e., your father Adam.

40,69,77,"Have you not regarded those who dispute the signs of God, the Qur’an, how they are turned 
away?, from faith — those who deny the Book, the Qur’an, and that wherewith We have sent Our messengers, in the 
way of the affirmation of [God’s] Oneness and [belief in] the Resurrection — and these [deniers] are the 
Meccan disbelievers. But they will come to know, the punishment for their denials; when ( idh has the meaning of idha) [with] fetters around their necks and chains (wa’l-salasilu, a 
supplement to al-aghlalu, ‘fetters’, so that the meaning is that these [chains] are also around their necks; 
or it [al-salasilu, chains’] is the subject, the predicate of which has been omitted, in other words [the 
meaning being]: around their feet [will be these chains] — or [alternatively] its predicate is [the follow¬ 
ing, yushabuna ]), they are dragged, in other words, they are dragged away by these [chains]. into the boiling water, that is, [into] Hell, then in the Fire they are set aflame. Then it will be said to them, in reproach: ‘Where are those whom you used to make partners,

Sura Ghafir or al-Mu’min besides God?’, alongside Him, and these are the idols. They will say, ‘They have forsaken, 
abandoned, us, and so we cannot see them. Nay, but [adually] we were not invoking anything before’. 
They deny that they used to worship these [idols]; but then these [idols] are brought [before them] — 
[which is where] God, exalted be He, says: ‘Truly you and what you worship besides God shall be fuel 
for Hell’ [Q. 21:98]). So, in the same way that these disbelievers have been led astray, God leads aftray 
the disbelievers. And it will also be said to them: ‘That, chastisement, is because you used to exult in the earth 
without right, by [your] idolatry and denial of resurrection, and because you were insolent, committing 
aCts of disobedience in abundance. Enter the gates of Hell, to abide therein’. Evil then is the [ultimate] abode of the arrogant! So be patient. Assuredly God’s promise, to chastise them, is true. And if We show you (fa-imma 
contains an assimilated conditional particle in; the ma is extra and emphasises the conditional import 
at the beginning of the verb, while the nun emphasises it at the end) apart of what We promise them, 
of chastisement, in your lifetime (the response to the conditional has been omitted, in other words [it is 
something like]: ‘then so be it!’) ...orWe take you unto Us [in death], before their chastisement, then [in 
any case] to Us they will be returned, whereupon We shall chaStise them with the moSt severe punish¬ 
ment (this [laSt] mentioned response is that of the supplement only). 1","Do you not see those who dispute concerning the signs of Allah, how can they be turned away? . those who reject the Book and what We sent Our messengers with. They will soon come to know, . when the shackles will be around their necks, and with chains they will be dragged . into the scalding water, then they will be burned in the Fire. . Then it will be said to them, “Where are those whom you used to associate as partners . with Allah?” They will say, “We have lost them; rather, we never used to call upon anything before.” This is how Allah causes the disbelievers to stray. . [They will be told], “This is because you used to rejoice on earth wrongfully, and you used to exult [arrogantly]. . Enter the gates of Hell, abiding therein forever. Terrible is indeed the abode of the arrogant!” . So be patient [O Prophet]. Allah’s promise is true; whether We show you some of what We threaten them with, or cause you to die [before that], to Us they will be returned.",
40,78,78,"And verily We sent messengers before you. Of them are those whom We have recounted to you, 
and of them are those whom We have not recounted to you: it is reported that God, exalted be He, sent 
8,000 prophets, 4,000 prophets [sent] from among the Children of Israel and [the other] 4,000 from 
among the remainder of mankind. And it was never [permitted] for any messenger, from among them, 
to bring a sign except with God’s permission, for they are [also] servants enthralled [by Him]. Hence 
when God’s command comes, for the chastisement to be sent down on the disbelievers, judgement, be¬ 
tween the messengers and their deniers, is passed juftly; and it is thence that the advocates of falsehood 
become losers, that is to say, [it is thence that] the judgement and the loss become manifest for mankind, 
although such [advocates of falsehood] will have always been losers always before that.","We have sent messengers before you; of them are some whose stories We have told you, and some We have not. It was not for a messenger to bring a sign except with Allah’s permission. But when the decree of Allah comes, judgment will be passed with justice, thereupon the people of falsehood will be in utter loss.",
40,79,85,"God it is Who made for you cattle — it is said that ‘camels’ are Specifically meant here, even 
though it seems to signify cows and sheep also — that you may ride some of them and eat of some. And there are [other] uses for you in them, such as [their] milk, offspring, fur and wool, and that 
by them you may satisfy any need that is in your breasts, namely, to transport heavy loads to [other] 
lands, and on them, on land, and on the ships, in the sea, you are carried. And He shows you His signs. So which of God’s signs, that is, [the signs] that prove His Oneness, 
do you rejeft? (the interrogative here is meant as a rebuke; ayya, ‘which of’ is more commonly made 
masculine than feminine). Have they not travelled across the land to see the nature of the consequence for those before 
them? They were more powerful than them in might and in [their] vefiiges on earth, in the way of large 
Structures and palaces. But what they used to earn did not avail them. And when their messengers brought them clear signs, manifest miracles, they, the disbeliev¬ 
ers, exulted in the knowledge they, the messengers, possessed, an exultation that entailed mockery and 
amusement, as they rejected such [knowledge], and there besieged, befell, them that which they used to 
deride, namely, the chastisement. Then, when they saw Our doom, that is, the severity of Our chastisement, they said, ‘We believe 
in God alone, and we disavow what we used to associate with Him’. 

1 That is, the reSJjonse to the second clause, beginning with ‘or We take you unto us..For the first clause is followed by an ellipsis 
which, as the commentator has pointed out is something along the lines of‘then so be if ( fa-dhaka ). 


453 


Tafsir al-Jalalayn But their faith was of no benefit to them when they saw Our doom — [This is] God’s way 
( sunnata’Llahi is in the accusative because it functions as a verbal noun from an implicit verb of the same 
expression ) 2 with the believers, among all communities, which is that faith is of no benefit to them once 
the chastisement has been sent down, which has its precdent; and it is thence that the disbelievers will 
be losers — [it is thence that] their Status as losers will become apparent to all [of mankind], even though 
they will have always been losers before that. 


2 In other words, it is as if there had been a preceding sanna, so: sanna’Llahu sunnatahu, ‘God established this way of His’.

They were more in number and far superior in strength, and more impressive in marks that they left behind in the land, but all what they had earned was of no avail to them. . When their messengers came to them with clear proofs, they exulted in whatever knowledge they had[20], and they were overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule. . But when they saw Our punishment, they said, “We believe in Allah alone, and we reject what we used to associate with Him.” . But their faith was of no benefit to them when they saw Our punishment.

words, He made them to be, seven heavens in two days — Thursday and Friday. He completed them in 
the laSt hour thereof, in which He created Adam — which is why He does not say sawd’an, ‘evenly’ here 
[as He did earlier]; what is said here concords with those verse in which it is stated that the heavens and 
the earth were created in six days; and in each heaven He revealed its commandment’, that to which He 
commanded those in it [to follow], in the way of obedience and worship. And We adorned the lowest 
heaven with lamps, with stars, and [this was also] to guard them ( hifzan is in the accusative because of 
its implicit verbal sense, in other words, ‘We guarded it against the devils leSt they try to listen therein [to

of His creatures.","Say, “Do you disbelieve in the One Who created the earth in two Days[3] and you set up rivals to Him? Such is the Lord of the worlds. .

41,13,18,"But if they, that is, the Meccan disbelievers, turn away, from belief, after this clear statement, 
then say, ‘I warn you of, I threaten you [with], a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt of c Ad and Thamud’, 
in other words, a chastisement that will destroy you like the one that destroyed them. When the messengers came to them from in front of them and from behind them, that is, com¬ 
ing to them [to warn them] and leaving them behind [as they departed], but they disbelieved, as will be 
Stated shortly — the destruction [of them meant] would only take place in his time — saying, ‘Worship 
none but God’, they said, ‘Had our Lord willed, He would have surely sent down, to us, angels; there¬ 
fore we indeed disbelieve in what you, according to your claim, have been sent with!’ As for c Ad, they ailed arrogantly in the earth without right, and they said, upon their being 
threatened with the chastisement, ‘Who is more powerful than us in might?’, in other words, [they be¬ 
lieved] no one [to be so] — a single man among them could pull out a huge rock from a mountainside 
and [have the Strength to] place it wherever he wished. Did they not see, [did they not] realise, that God, 
He Who created them, was more powerful than them in might? And they used to deny Our signs, the 
miracles [We sent down]. So We unleashed upon them a raging wind, cold and violent, but without rain, during [some] 
ill-fated days (read nahisatin, or nahsdtin ), [days that were] calamitous for them, that We might make 
them taSte the chastisement of disgrace, humiliation, in the life of this world; yet the chastisement of 
the Hereafter is indeed more disgracefid, more severe, and they will not be helped, to have it warded 
off from them. And as for Thamud, We offered them guidance. We pointed out to them the path of guidance, 
but they preferred blindness, they chose disbelief [as opposed], to guidance. So the thunderbolt of the 
humiliating chastisement seized them on account of what they used to earn. And We delivered, from it, those who believed and feared, God.","But if they turn away, then say, “I warn you of a blast like the one that befell ‘Ād and Thamūd, . when the messengers came to them from the front and from behind [saying], “Worship none but Allah,” they said, “If our Lord had willed [7], He would have sent down angels; so we disbelieve in what you have been sent with.” . As for ‘Ād, they were arrogant in the land without right, and said, “Who is more powerful than us?” Did they not see that Allah, Who created them, is more powerful than them? Yet they continued to reject Our signs. . So We sent against them a roaring wind[8] for several inauspicious days to make them taste a disgracing punishment in the life of this world, but the punishment of the Hereafter is far more disgracing, and they will not be helped. . As for Thamūd, We showed them guidance, but they preferred blindness over guidance. So they were seized by the blast of a debasing punishment for what they used to commit. . And We saved those who believed and feared Allah.","[7] To send us messengers. . [8] i.e., a screaming and furious wind."

S]ieak. And He created you the firSt time, and to Him you will be returned: it is said that this Statement is 
made by their skins; but it is also said to be God’s words, as is the case with what follows, for it is similar 
in context to what preceded, namely, that the One with the power to originate you without any precedent 
and restore you to life after death, also has the power to make your skins and your limbs S]ieak. 


456 


Sura Fussilat And you did not use to conceal yourselves, when you used to commit lewd aCts, left your hearing 
or your eyes or your skins should bear witness againft you, because you were never certain about [the 
truth of] resurrection; but you thought, when you used to conceal yourselves, that God did not know 
moft of what you did. And that ( wa-dhalikum, the subject) supposition of yours ( zannukum, substitutes for it) which 
you supposed of your Lord (alladhi zanantum bi-rabbikum, a descriptive clause; the predicate [is the fol¬ 
lowing, ardakum ]) has ruined you, that is, it has brought about your destruction. So you have become 
among the losers’. So if they endure, the chastisement, the Fire will [flill] be their abode; and if they seek reconcili¬ 
ation, if they seek the satisfaction [of God], then they will not be among the reconciled, those deemed 
satisfactory [by God].","And [consider] the Day when Allah’s enemies will be gathered to the Fire, driven in rows. . until when they reach it, their hearing, their sight and their skins will testify[9] against them concerning what they used to do. . They will say to their skins, “Why did you testify against us?” They will say, “It is Allah Who made us to speak, the One Who made everything speak. It is He Who created you the first time, and to Him you will be returned. . You did not bother to hide yourselves [when committing sins] from your hearing, your sight, and your skins lest they testify against you; rather you thought that Allah does not know much of what you do. . Such was your assumption that you entertained about your Lord that ruined you, so you became losers.” . Even if they endure patiently, the Fire will still be their abode; and if they seek to make amends, they will not be allowed to do so.","[9] On the Day of Judgment, the wicked will deny the evil deeds in their record of deeds - in an attempt to escape the punishment. They will be asked if they accept Allah, the angels, or even their own families and neighbors as witnesses, but they will refuse. So Allah will make their organs testify against them. [Ibn Kathīr]"

severe chaftisement, and We will verily requite them the worft of what they used to do, in other words, 
[with] the worSt requital for their deeds. That, severe chastisement and worSt requital, is the requital of God’s enemies (jazd’u adai, the 
second hamza maybe pronounced fully or replaced with a wow) — the Fire! ( al-naru, an explicative sup¬ 
plement to jazau, ‘the requital’, alluded to by [the demonstrative] dhalika, ‘that’). Therein will be their 
everlafting abode, that is, as a place of [permanent] residence, from which there will be no removal, as 
a requital (jaza’an is in the accusative as a verbal noun from the implicit verbal action) for their denial 
of Our signs, [for their denial of] the Qur’an. And those who disbelieve will say, [while] in the Fire: ‘Our Lord, show us those who led us 
aftray from among the jinn and mankind — namely, Iblls and Cain [respectively], both of whom estab¬ 
lished disbelief and slaying as something to be emulated — so that we may have them underneath our 
feet [to trample them], in the Fire, that they may be among the lowermoft’, in other words, in a chastise¬

Those who disbelieve say, “Do not listen to this Qur’an, but make noise [when it is recited], so that you may prevail.” . We will surely make those who disbelieve taste a severe punishment, and We will surely recompense them according to the worst of what they used to do. . Such is the recompense of the enemies of Allah: the Fire, which will be their eternal home, as a recompense for their rejection of Our verses. .

who — in other words, none — will be further aStray than one who is in extreme defiance?’, of the truth 
(this [third person singular address] is used instead of‘[who will be further astray] than you’ in order to 
point out their status [as disbelievers]).","Man never tires of asking for good, but if evil touches him, he is desperate and despondent. .

which We enjoined upon Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus [declaring], ‘Establish religion and do not be 
divided in it’: this is what has been prescribed and enjoined upon [those mentioned above], and what 
has been revealed to Muhammad (s), and it is the affirmation of [God’s] Oneness. Dreadful is for the 
idolaters that to which you summon them, in the way of affirming the Oneness [of God]. God chooses 
for it, for the [task of] affirming [His] Oneness, whomever He will, and He guides to it whomever turns

them in their desires, to abandon it. And say: ‘I believe in whatever Book God has revealed. And I have 
been commanded to be juft between you, in passing judgement. God is our Lord and your Lord. Our 
deeds concern us and your deeds concern you, and so each [one of us] will be requited according to his 
[own] deeds. There is no argument, [no] dispute, between us and you — this was [revealed] before the

Allah chooses for Himself whom He wills and guides to Himself who turns to Him. . They did not become divided except after the knowledge had come to them[10], out of envious rivalry between them. Were it not for a prior decree from your Lord until an appointed term[11], a decisive judgment would already have been passed between them. Indeed, those who inherited the Scripture[12] after them are in disquieting doubt about it. . Therefore call to that [religion, O Prophet] and keep to the straight path as you are commanded, and do not follow their desires, and say, “I believe in every Scripture that Allah has sent down, and I have been commanded to judge fairly among you.

repentance has been made, and knows what they do (yafaluna, may also be read tafaluna, ‘you do’). And He answers those who believe and perform righteous deeds. He grants them what they 
ask for, and He enhances them of His bounty. And as for the disbelievers, for them there will be a 
severe chastisement.","That is the glad tidings that Allah gives to His slaves who believe and do righteous deeds.

Indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Appreciative. . Or do they say, “He has fabricated lies about Allah[18]!”? But if Allah willed, He could seal up your heart[19]. Allah wipes out falsehood and establishes the truth by His Words. Indeed, He is All-Knowing of what is in the hearts. . It is He Who accepts repentance from His slaves and pardons sins, and He knows all what you do. .

Surely He is Aware, Seer of His servants. And He it is Who sends down the [saving] rain after they have despaired, [after] they have given 
up hope of its being sent down, and unfolds His mercy. He extends His rain, and He is the [true] Patron, 
the Benevolent towards believers, the Praised, by them. And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and, the creation of, whatever He 
has scattered, [whatever] He has divided and spread, in them in the way of creatures (dabba : this de¬ 
notes all those [creatures] which tread [ yadubbu ] upon the earth, whether human beings or otherwise). 
And He is able to bring them together, for the Gathering, whenever He will (rational beings as opposed 
to others predominate in the [suffixed] pronoun [-him oijam’ihim, ‘to bring them together’]).

Tafsir al-Jalalayn And whatever afflidion, [whatever] misfortune or hardship, may befall you — [this is] an 
address to the believers — is on account of what your [own] hands have earned, that is to say, [for] 
the sins that you have committed — the use of ‘hands’ to express this is because mod adions are ef¬ 
fected by them. And He pardons much, of these [sins] and does not requite them, for God’s kindness 
is greater than that He should [for example] double the requital in the Hereafter; as for those who do 
not commit [grave] sins, then what befalls them in this world [of hardship] raises their degree in the 
[reward of the] Hereafter. And you, O idolaters, cannot escape, from God, by fleeing, on earth, and thus elude Him, and, 
besides God, that is to say, other than Him, you have neither protedor nor helper, to ward off His chas¬ 
tisement from you.","If Allah were to give abundant provision to [all] His slaves, they would transgress on earth; but He sends down what He wills in due measure. Indeed, He is All-Aware and All-Seeing of His slaves. . It is He Who sends down rain after they have lost hope, and spreads His mercy. He is the Guardian, the Praiseworthy. . Among His signs is the creation of the heavens and earth, and what He spread between them of all living creatures. And He is Most Capable of bringing them together whenever He wills. . Whatever calamity befalls you is because of what your own hands have earned, and He overlooks much. . You cannot escape [Him] on earth, and you do not have besides Allah any protector or helper.",
42,32,36,"And of His signs are the ships [that run] on the sea [appearing] like landmarks, like mountains, 
in terms of their magnitude. If He will, He dills the wind, whereat they remain, they become, motionless, fixed, not moving, 
on its surface. Surely in that there are signs for every deadfad, grateful [servant] — this is the believer, 
who is deadfad during hardship and grateful in [times of] comfort. Or He wrecks them (yubiqhunna, a supplement to yuskin, ‘He stills’), that is to say, [or] He sinks 
them, including their passengers, by sending violent winds [upon them], because of what they, that is, 
the passengers of these [ships], have earned, of sins. And He pardons much, of such [sin] and does not 
cause those who have sinned to drown. And that those who dispute concerning Our signs may know (read [indicative] wa-yalamu, ‘and 
[they] know’, beginning a new sentence; or [subjundive] wa-ya c lama, ‘and that [they] may know’, as a 
supplement to an implicit reason, in other words: ‘He drowns them in order to ex ad vengeance against 
them and so that they may know that ...’) they have no refuge, no escape from the chastisement (the 
negation represents two dired objeds of [the verb] yalamu [or ya’lama], ‘[they] know’; the negation is 
also a comment on the [implied] adion [of‘escaping’]). So whatever you — [this is] an address is to believers and others — have been given, of the 
luxuries of this world, is [but] the enjoyment of the life of this world, enjoyed for the duration of it but 
then perishes. But what is with God, of reward, is better and more lading for those who believe and put 
their trud in their Lord ( li’lladhina dmanu wa-‘ald rabbihim yatawakkaluna, is supplemented by [the 
following clause]),","And among His signs are the ships, sailing in the sea like mountains. . If He wills, He can still the wind, leaving the ships motionless on its surface. Indeed, there are signs in this for everyone who is steadfast and grateful. . Or He can capsize them[20] for what they committed, but He pardons much, . then those who dispute concerning Our signs will know that they have no escape. . Whatever you have been given is but a short enjoyment of the life of this world, but what is with Allah is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord;","[20] i.e., He could sink the ships by violent winds."
42,37,43,"and those who avoid grave sins and indecencies, those [ads] that require [the implementing of]

the way of affirming His Oneness and worship [of Him], and observe prayer, maintaining it regularly, 
and whose courses of adion, those [courses of adion] that seem good to them, are [a matter of]

We have bedowed on them, expend, in obedience to God — such mentioned [individuals] constitute 
one category; and those who, when they suffer aggression, injustice, defend themselves — these are another 
category — that is to say, they retaliate again,<t those who wrong them in the same manner in which the 
latter wronged them, as God, exalted be He, says: For the requital of an evil deed is an evil deed like it: the latter is [also] referred to as ‘an evil 
deed’ because in [outward] form it resembles the former; this is evident in what concerns retaliation for 
wounds. Some [scholars] say that even if another were to say, ‘May God disgrace you!’, then one should

give him his reward without doubt. Truly He does not like wrongdoers, that is, those who initiate ads of 
wrongdoing and so merit His punishment. And whoever defends himself after he has been wronged, that is to say, after the wrongdoer has 
wronged him —for such, there will be no course [ of action ] against them, no blame [on them]. A course [of action] is only [open] againft those who wrong people and seek [to commit], 
[who] commit, in the earth what is not right, [what are] ads of disobedience. For such there will be 
a painfid chastisement. But verily he who is patient, and defend himself [by retaliating], and forgives, excuses [the 
wrong done to him] — surely that, patience and excusing, is [true] constancy in [such] affairs, that is to 
say, it is one of those [courses of adion] for which one mud have firm resolve, meaning those which are 
required [of the believer] by [Gods] Law.","and those who avoid major sins and shameful deeds, and when they are angered, they forgive; . and those who respond to their Lord and establish prayer, and conduct their affairs by mutual consultation, and spend out of what We have provided for them; . and those who retaliate fairly when oppressed[21]. . The retribution of harm is its equivalent harm, but whoever pardons and seeks reconciliation, his reward is with Allah. Indeed, He does not like the wrongdoers. . But whoever retaliates after being wronged, there is no blame on them. . Blame is only on those who wrong people and transgress in the land without right. For such there will be a painful punishment. . But whoever observes patience and forgives, it is indeed a matter of great resolve[22].","[21] Restoring their rights to preserve their honor and dignity, especially if the oppressor does not deserve remission, or it does not serve any interest. .

your people deride you — this [Statement] is intended to comfort the Prophet (s). So We destroyed those who were mightier than them — than your people — in prowess. Strength,

result of Our giving the disbeliever what has been mentioned, We would have given him such [luxuries],

ance, while they suppose that they are [rightly] guided (the plural [muhtaduna] takes into account the 
[potentially plural] sense of man, ‘whoever’, [of the previous verse]), until when he comes to Us, such a blind one, together with his companion, on the Day of Resur¬ 
rection, he says, to him: ‘O (ya is for calling attention) would that there were between me and you the 
distance of the two eaSls!’, that is to say, like the distance between the east and the weSt, What an evil 
companion then!, you are for me. God, exalted be He, says: And it, your wishes or your remorse, will not benefit you, blind ones, this day, given that you 
did wrong, that is to say, [given that] it has become clear to you that you were wrongdoers, through your 
idolatry in this world, that you, together with your companions, will be sharing in the chastisement (this 
constitutes the justification, on the basis of an implied lam [sc. li-annakum ...], for the ‘lack of benefit’;

idh substitutes for al-yawma, ‘this day’).","Whoever turns away from the Reminder of the Most Compassionate [i.e., the Qur’an], We assign to him a devil to be his close associate, . who will surely avert them from the [right] way, while they think that they are rightly guided. . Then when he comes to Us, he will say [to his devil associate], “I wish you were as distant from me as the East and West. What a terrible associate [you were]!” . [They will be told], “As you have done wrong, it will not benefit you Today that you are sharing the punishment[14].”","[14] In the life of this world, it is comforting to many people when they hear that others also went through similar trials. However, this will not be the case on Judgment Day, as everyone will be desperate to save themselves, regardless of what happens to others."

ror?, in other words, such [individuals] will not believe. So if (fa-imma: the conditional particle in has been assimilated herein with an extra ma) We 
take you away, by making you die before chastising them, then We will take vengeance on them, in the 
Hereafter; or We show you, during your lifetime, that which We have promised them, in the way of chas- 
tisement , for surely We have power over, [surely] We are able to chaStise, them. So holdfast to that which has been revealed to you, namely, the Qur’an; surely you are on a 
Straight path, [a Straight] way. And it is indeed a Reminder, an honour, for you and for your people, as it has been revealed in 
their language. And you will [eventually] be questioned, about [the extent of] your fulfilling your duty 
towards it. And ask those of Our messengers whom We sent before you: Did We [ever] appoint, besides the 
Compassionate One, that is to say, [any] other than Him, gods to be worshipped? It is said that this is to 
be understood literally, in other words, that God gathered for him all the messengers on the Night [of 
the] Journey; but it is also said that this meant [that he should ask] any communities belonging to either 
of the two Peoples of the Scripture. According to one of the two opinions, he never asked [anyone] since 
the point of this command to ask is to affirm to the idolaters of Quraysh that no messenger or scripture 
ever came from God with the command to worship [any] other than God.","Can you make the deaf hear, or guide the blind or the one who is clearly misguided? . Either We take you away [in death], We will surely exact retribution upon them, . or We will show you what We warned them of, for We have full power over them. . So hold fast to what is revealed to you. You are indeed on a straight path. . This [Qur’an] is surely a glory[15] for you and your people, and you will [all] be questioned. .

43,46,56,"And verily We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his council, namely, the Egyptians 
( al-Qibt ), and he said, ‘I am indeed the messenger of the Lord of the Worlds’. But when he brought them Our signs, those proving his mission [from God], behold! they 
laughed at them. And We never showed them a sign, from among the signs of chastisement, such as the flood, 
which was when the waters [of the Nile] penetrated their dwellings and for seven days rose as high as 
their throats as they sat, or [the chastisement of] the locuSts, but it was greater than the one before it, the 
one immediately preceding it. And We seized them with chastisement, that perhaps they might recant, 
their disbelief. And they said, to Moses, upon seeing the chastisement, ‘O sorcerer! — that is to say, ‘[O] knowl¬ 
edgeable, perfect one’, since for them sorcery was an awesome [form of] knowledge — supplicate your 
Lord for us by the covenant that He has made with you, [to the effecft] that He would relieve us from 
chastisement if we believe. Assuredly we will be guided’, that is to say, [we will become] believers. But as soon as We relieved them, by the supplication of Moses, from the chastisement, behold! 
they had broken their pledge, reneging on their covenant and persisting in their disbelief. And Pharaoh proclaimed, boastfully, among his people, ‘O my people, does not the kingdom of 
Egypt belong to me, and these rivers, of the Nil e, flowing beneath me?, that is to say, beneath my palaces. 
Do you not perceive?, my magnificence. Or, do you perceive, in which case, am I not better than this one, namely, Moses, who is con¬ 
temptible, feeble and lowly, and who can scarcely Speak clearly?, [who can scarcely] articulate his Speech, 
because of his liSJ> — which was the result of his [accidentally] placing a hot coal in his mouth when he 
was a child.

gold necklaces — or the angels not come with him one after the other?’, in succession, to testify to his 
truthfulness.  Thus did he. Pharaoh, persuade, incite, his people and they obeyed him, in his wish that Moses 
be denied. They were truly an immoral folk. 

[43 : 55] So when they had angered Us, We took vengeance on them and drowned them all.  And We made them a thing pafl ( salaf is the plural of sdlif similar [in pattern] to khadim, khad- 
am ) that is to say, a precedent, as a lesson, and an example for others, after them, that they [posterity] 
might take their predicament as a lesson and so not engage in actions similar to theirs.","Indeed, We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his courtiers, so he said: “I am a messenger of the Lord of the worlds.” . But as soon as he came to them with Our signs, they laughed at them. . Every sign We showed them was greater than the one before it[16], and We seized them with punishment[17] so that they may turn in repentance. . They said, “O magician, call upon your Lord for us, by virtue of the covenant He has made with you[18]; we will surely accept guidance.” . But as soon We removed the punishment from them, they broke their promise. . Pharaoh proclaimed to his people, “O my people, does not the kingdom of Egypt belong to me, and these streams[19] flowing at my feet? Do you not see? . Or am I not better than this contemptible one who can hardly express himself[20]? . Then why are there not sent down upon him bracelets of gold or come with him angels to support him?” . Thus he made a fool of his people and they obeyed him. They were indeed a wicked people. . When they angered Us, We exacted Our retribution and drowned them all. . Thus We made them a precedent and a lesson[21] for the later generations.","[16] i.e., the bright hand and the staff turning into a serpent. See 20:17-22.

43,57,66,"And when the son of Mary is cited as an example — after God’s [following] words were revealed: 
‘Truly you and what you worship besides God shall be fuel for Hell’ [Q. 21:98] and the idolaters said, ‘We 
are satisfied that our gods be together with Jesus [in Hell], for he too was worshipped besides God’ —

they hear. And they say, Are our gods better or he?’, Jesus. We are satisfied that our gods be [in the same 
predicament] with him. They only cite this, that is, the example, to you for the sake of contention, [mere¬

worship’] refers [only] to non-rational beings and cannot therefore include Jesus, peace be upon him. 
Nay, but they are a contentious lot, an extremely disputatious folk. He, Jesus, is only a servant [of Ours] on whom We be flowed favour, through prophethood, and 
We made him, by his [coming into] being without a father, an exemplar for the Children of Israel, that 
is to say, like an example because of the wondrousness of his case, one from which one is able to infer 
God’s power, exalted be He, to do whatever He will. And had We willed, We would have appointed among you, in Stead of you, angels to be [your] 
successors in the earth, by Our destroying you. And indeed he, that is, Jesus, is a portent of the Hour — [the arrival of] it is known by the send¬ 
ing down of him — so do not doubt it ( tamtarunna : the indicative nun has been omitted for apocopation 
together with the waw of the [third] person [plural] on account of two unvowelled consonants coming 
together) but, say to them: ‘Follow me, in the affirmation of [God’s] Oneness. This, to which I command 
you, is a flraightpath’. And do not let Satan bar you, [do not let him] turn you away from God’s religion. Indeed he is 
a manifefl enemy of yours, one whose enmity is manifest. And when Jesus came with the clear signs, the miracles and the prescriptions [of the Law], he 
said, ‘Verily I have brought you wisdom, prophethood and the prescriptions of the GoSpel, and [I have 
come] to make clear to you some of what you are at variance over, in the way of the rulings of the Torah 
for what concerns religion and otherwise — and he [indeed] made clear to them the matters of religion. 
So fear God and obey me. Assuredly God is my Lord and your Lord; so worship Him — that is a flraight path’. But the faflions differed among themselves, regarding [the Status of] Jesus: was he God, or 
the son of God, or the third of Three [deities]? So woe ( waylun is a term implying chastisement) to 
those who do wrong, [those] who blaspheme in what they say about Jesus, from the chaflisement of

the management of His creatures, the Knower, of their welfare. And Blessed, Magnificent, be He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth 
and all that is between them; and with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, [of] when it shall come 
to pass, and to Him they will [all] be returned ( yurja’una, may also be read [second person plural]

besides God, have no power of intercession, for anyone, except those who bear witness to the truth, that 
is, those who say ‘there is no god except God’, with [full] knowledge, in their hearts of what they have 
teftilied to with their tongues — such are Jesus, Ezra, and the angels, who will intercede for believers. And if(wa-la-in: the lam is for oaths) you ask them who created them, they will surely say, ‘God’

ing of the sea, [the sending down of] manna and quails and other such [signs].","Indeed, We tested the people of Pharaoh before them, when a noble messenger came to them, . [saying], “Hand over to me the slaves of Allah[5]. I am indeed a trustworthy messenger to you, . and do not be arrogant towards Allah. I have certainly come to you with clear proof. . And I certainly seek refuge with my Lord and your Lord, lest you stone me to death[6]. . If you do not believe me, then leave me alone.” . Then he called upon his Lord, “These are wicked people”. . [Allah said], “Leave along with My slaves by night; you will surely be pursued. . And leave the sea parted[7]; for they are surely an army destined to drown.” . [Imagine] how many gardens and springs they left behind, . and crops and splendid mansions, . and luxuries they used to rejoice therein. . So it was; and We made another people inherit all that. . Neither the heaven nor earth wept for them, nor were they given any respite. . Thus did We save the Children of Israel from the humiliating punishment, . from Pharaoh. He was indeed arrogant who transgressed all bounds. . We chose them[8] knowingly over all other peoples. . And We gave them signs in which there was a clear test.","[5] i.e., the Children of Israel. . [6] Or assault me with your tongues. .

have died, that is to say, that we will be given life [again]. God, exalted be He, says: Are they better, or the people of Tubba c — [he was] a prophet or a right¬ 
eous man — and those, communities, before them? We destroyed, because of their disbelief. In other 
words: they are not mightier than those, and yet they were destroyed; indeed they were criminals. And We did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, [intending] to 
play, by creating all that ( laibina, ‘to play’, is a circumstantial qualifier). We did not create them, and all that is between them, except with the truth, that is to say, [We 
created them] rightfully so that one might infer thereby Our power and Our Oneness and other matters; 
but mod of them, that is, the Meccan disbelievers, do not know.","Indeed, these [Makkans] say, . “There is nothing after our first death, and we will not be resurrected, . then bring back our forefathers if you are truthful.” . Are they better [in power] or the people of Tubba‘[9] and those who were before them? We destroyed them, for they were truly wicked[10]. .

they be helped — [nor will they] be protected from it ( yawma, ‘the day’, is a substitution for yawma’l-fasl,

ever-torturous (this [use of‘the torture of boiling water’] is rhetorically more intense than what is Stated 
by the verse: boiling water will be poured over their heads [Q. 22:19]). And it will be said to him: ‘Tafte!, that is, [taSte] the chastisement. Indeed you are the mighty, 
the noble one!, as you claimed when you used to say, ‘There is nothing between its two mountains [sc.

be admonished and become believers — but they do not believe. So be on the look out, await their destruction. Indeed they [too] are on the look out, for your

of what they are warned, [of what] they are threatened with in the way of [impending] chastisement. Say: ‘Have you considered, [say] Inform me [about], what you invoke, [what] you worship, be¬ 
sides God?, namely, the idols ( min duni’Llahi, constitutes the firSt objed [of the verb]). Show me — 
inform me — (arum, [repeated] for emphasis), what they have created (madha khalaqu, the second 
objeCt) of the earth (mina’l-ardi, the explication of ma, ‘what [part]’). Or do they have any share, any 
partnership, in, the creation of, the heavens?, with God? (am, or’, has the significance of the [rhetorical 
interrogative] hamza of denial). Bring me a scripture, [that has been] revealed, before this, Qur’an, or 
some veftige, some remnant, of knowledge, transmitted from the ancients confirming the soundness of 
your claim that your worship of the idols brings you closer to God, if you are truthful’, in your claim. And who is (man here is interrogative but meant [rhetorically] as a negation: in other words, ‘no 
one is’) further adray than him who invokes, [him who] worships, besides God, that is to say, other than 
Him, such as woidd not respond to him [even] until the Day of Resurrection — these are the idols, who 
never answer those who worship them in anything that they ask for — and who are heedless of their 
supplication?, their worship, because they are inanimates that possess no [faculty of] comprehension.","Hā Mīm[1]. . The revelation of this Book is from Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. . We have not created the heavens and earth and all that is between them except for a true purpose and for a set term, yet those who disbelieve turn away from what they have been warned of. . Say, “Tell me about those whom you invoke besides Allah; show me what they have created on the earth, or do they have a share in the heavens? Bring me a scripture revealed before this, or some remnant of knowledge, if you are truthful.” . Who is more astray than one who invokes besides Allah those who will not respond to him until the Day of Resurrection, and are in fact unaware of their invocations?",[1] See footnote 2:1.
46,6,8,"And when mankind are gathered, they, the idols, will be enemies to them, to those who had 
worshipped them, and they will deny, they will disavow, their worship, the worship of those who had 
worshipped them. And when Our signs, the Qur’an, are recited to them, namely, [to] the people of Mecca, being 
clear signs, manifest [signs] (bayyinatin is a circumstantial qualifier), those who disbelieve, from among 
them, say of the truth, that is, the Qur’an, when it comes to them, ‘This is plain sorcery!’, clear and evi¬ 
dent [sorcery]. Or (am has the significance of bal, ‘nay, but...’ and the [rhetorical interrogative] hamza of denial) 
do they say, ‘He has invented it?’, that is, the Qur’an. Say: ‘If I have invented it, hypothetically [Sneak¬ 
ing] , dill you woidd have no power to avail me again Cl God, that is to say, againSt His chastisement, in 
any way, in other words, you would not be able to ward it off from me if God chooses to chaStise me. 
He knows bed what you delve into [ of gossip ] concerning it, what you say about the Qur’an. He, exalted 
be He, suffices as a witness between me and you. And He is the Forgiving, to the one who repents, the 
Merciful’, to him, and so He does not hasten to punish you.","When such people are gathered, they will become their enemies and will reject their worship. . When Our clear verses are recited to them, those who disbelieve say about the truth when it comes to them, “This is clear magic.” . Or do they say, “He has fabricated it”? Say, “If I did fabricate it, there is nothing you can do to protect me against Allah. He knows best that in which you indulge[2]. He is Sufficient as a witness between me and you, and He is the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.”",[2] Of false accusations and slander about Qu’ran and Prophet (ﷺ).
46,9,14,"Say: ‘I am not a novelty, unprecedented, among the messengers, that is to say, [I am not] the firSt 
to be sent [by God as His Messenger]. Already many of them have come before me, so how can you deny 
me? Nor do I know what will be done with me or with you, in this world: will I be made to leave my [na¬ 
tive] land, or will I be slain as was done with [some] prophets before me, or will you Stone me to death, 
or will the earth be made to swallow you as [it did] deniers before you? I only follow what is revealed to 
me, that is, the Qur’an, and I do not invent anything myself. And I am only a plain Warner’, one whose 
warning is plain. 


Sura al-Ahqdf Say: ‘Have you considered?, [say:] inform me, what will be your predicament, if it, the Qur’an, 
is from God and you disbelieve in it ( wa-kafartum bihi, the sentence is a circumstantial qualifier), and a 
witness from the Children of Israel has [already] testified, this was ‘Abd Allah b. Salam, to the like of it, 
that is to say, to it [the Qur’an], that it is from God, and he, the witness, has believed [in it], while you 
aid with arrogance you are disdainful of faith (the response to the conditional [‘if ...’] is given [by 
implication] in what has been supplemented to it, in other words: ‘Would you not then be [considered] 
wrongdoers?’; this [understanding of the response] is indicated by [what follows]). Truly God does not 
guide wrongdoing folk’. And those who disbelieve say of those who believe, that is, [they say] with regards to them: ‘Had 
it, faith, been [anything] good, they would not have attained it before us’. And since they, the ones 
[now] Sneaking, will not be guided by it, that is, [by] the Qur’an, they say, ‘litis, that is, the Qur’an, is 
an ancient lie!’ Yet before it, that is, [before] the Qur’an, [there was] the Book of Moses, that is, the Torah, as 
a guidepod and a mercy, for those who believed in it ( imaman wa-rahmatan are two circumstantial 
qualifiers) and this, Qur’an, is a Book that confirms, scriptures before it, in the Arabic tongue ( lisdnan 
‘arabiyyan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of musaddiqun, ‘that confirms’) to warn 
those who do wrong, the idolaters of Mecca, and, it is, good tidings for the virtuous, the believers. Assuredly those who say, ‘Our Lord is God’ and then remain upright, in [their adherence to] 
obedience, no fear will befall them, nor will they grieve. Those will be the inhabitants of Paradise, abiding therein (khalidina fiha is a circumstantial 
qualifier) as a reward (jaza’an is in the accusative as a verbal noun, because of the implied verbal adtion, 
that is to say, yujzawna, ‘they will be rewarded’) for what they used to do.","Say, “I am not the first of the messengers[3], nor do I know what will happen to me or to you. I only follow what is revealed to me, and I am not but a clear warner.” . Say, “What do you think, if this [Qur’an] is really from Allah and yet you reject it, and a witness[4] from the Children of Israel has testified in its favor and believed[5], whereas you persist in arrogance[6]? Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.” . The disbelievers say about the believers, “If this [faith] were something good, they[7] would not have believed in it before us.” Now since they are not guided by it, they will say, “This is an old fabrication.” . And before it was the Scripture of Moses a guide and a mercy. This Book is a confirmation of it, in the Arabic language, in order to warn those who do wrong and give glad tidings to those who do good. . Indeed, those who say, “Our Lord is Allah”, then remain steadfast, they will have no fear, nor will they grieve. . They are the people of Paradise; abiding therein forever, as a reward for what they used to do.","[3] To be surprised at my message, nor have I brought something different from the previous messengers. . [4] Such as Abdullah ibn Salām, a Jewish scholar, who accepted Islam when the Prophet (ﷺ) emigrated from Makkah to Medina.
 [5] Based on information in the Torah testifying his message.
 [6] The estimated conclusion could be ""...would you not then be unjust and wrongdoer people?"" . [7] These poor and powerless individuals and slaves who embraced Islam."
46,15,18,"And We have enjoined man to be kind ( husnan: a variant reading has ihsanan ), that is to say, We 
have commanded him to adt kindly towards both of them (thus ihsanan is in the accusative as a verbal 
noun, because of the implied verbal adtion; the same applies to husnan) to his parents. His mother car¬ 
ries him in travail, and gives birth to him in travail, that is to say, with suffering; and his gestation and 
his weaning, from suckling, take thirty months, six months being the minimum period for geStation, the 
remainder being the maximum period of suckling; it is also said that, regardless of whether she bore him 
for six or nine months, she should suckle him for the remainder. So that ( hatta is a [particle of] purpose 
for an implied sentence, that is to say, wa-‘asha hatta, ‘and he lived on so that ...’) when he is mature, 
namely, at his prime in terms of his strength, intelledt and reasoning, the minimum [age] for which is 
thirty or thirty three years, and reaches forty years, that is, exadtly [forty years], which is the maximum 
for [attaining] maturity, he says, ‘My Lord!, [this] to the end [of this verse] was revealed regarding Abu 
Bakr al-Siddlq, when he had reached forty years of age, two years after the [beginning of the] Prophet’s 
Mission (s). He [Abu Bakr] believed in him, whereafter his parents believed [in the Prophet], followed 
by his son ‘Abd al-Rahman, then ‘Abd al-Rahman’s son Abu ‘Atlq [Muhammad b. ‘Abd al-Rahman]. 1 
Inspire me to give thanks for Your favour with which You have favoured me and my parents, namely, 
[the grace of] affirming [God’s] Oneness, and that I may ad righteously in a way that will please You, 
thus he [Abu Bakr] emancipated nine believers who had been enduring torture [at the hands of the 
idolaters] for [their belief in] God, and inved my seed with righteousness, all of them were believers. 
Indeed I repent to You and I am truly of those who submit [ to You]’. Those, that is, those who say such words, Abu Bakr and others, are they from whom We accept 
the bed of what they do, and overlook their misdeeds, [as they dand] among the inhabitants of Para¬ 
dise (fi ashdbi’ll-jannati, a circumstantial qualifier, in other words, ‘being among them) — [this is] the 
true promise which they were promised, by His words, God has promised the believers, both men and 
women, Gardens ... [Q. 9:72]. 

1 Famously, and uniquely in this redjaedt, the only case where there were four generations of the same patrilineal line all of whom 
were contemporaries of the Prophet was with these four men: Abu Bakr’s father, Abu Bakr himself, his son ‘Abd al-Rahman, and 
the latter’s son Abu ‘Atlq Muhammad; on this last see Ibn al-Athir, Usd, vi, 204 (no. 6090). 


483 


Tafsir al-Jalalayn As for him who says to his parents ( li-walidayhi : a variant reading has li-wdlidihi, ‘his parent’, 
denoting the generic noun): ‘Fie (read uffm or uffan, as a verbal noun, meaning: ‘[something] putrid and 
disgusting’) on you both: I am exasperated at both of you. Do you threaten me ( a-ta‘idanini: a variant 
reading has a-ta‘idanni) that I shall be raised, from the grave, when already generations, communities, 
have passed away before me?’, and they have not been raised from their graves. And they call on God for 
succour, that he [their child] repent, saying [to him]: if you do not repent, ‘Woe to you ( waylaka, that is 
to say, haldkaka, ‘you are ruined!’). Believe!, in resurrection. Surely God’s promise is true’. But he says, 
‘This, belief in resurrection, is nothing but the fables of the ancients’, lies of theirs. Such are the ones against whom the Word, of chastisement, is due, is necessary, concerning com¬ 
munities of jinn and humans that have passed away before them. Truly they are losers.","We have enjoined upon man kindness to his parents. His mother bore him in hardship and gave birth to him in hardship, and his bearing and weaning take thirty months, until when he reaches full maturity and reaches forty years, he says, “My Lord, inspire me to be grateful to Your favors which You blessed me and my parents with, and to do righteous deeds that will make You pleased; and make my offspring righteous. Indeed, I repent to you, and I am one of the Muslims [submitting to You].” . Such are those from whom We will accept their best deeds and overlook their misdeeds. They will be among the people of Paradise – a true promise that they were given. . But some say to their parents, “Fie upon you both! Are you warning me that I will be resurrected, even though many generations have passed before me [yet none was resurrected]?” His parents cry seeking Allah’s help, “Woe to you! Believe! The promise of Allah is true.” But he says, “This is nothing but ancient fables.” . Such are those upon whom the punishment has become binding, as happened to communities of Jinn and men before them, for they were truly losers.",
46,19,20,"And for each one, of both categories, believer and disbeliever, there will be degrees [of flatus], 
thus the degrees of the believers in Paradise are high, while the degrees of disbelievers in the Fire are 
despicable, according to what they have done, that is to say, [according to what] believers [have done] in 
the way of ads of obedience, and disbelievers, in the way of aCts of disobedience, and that He may rec¬ 
ompense them fully, namely, God (li-yuwaffiyahum: a variant reading has li-nuwaffyahum, ‘that We may 
recompense them fully’) for their deeds, that is, [pay them] their deserts, and they will not be wronged, 
[not even] in a single thing that may be diminished for believers or increased for disbelievers. And on the day when those who disbelieve are exposed to the Fire, by its being revealed for 
them, it will be said to them: ‘You squandered (read with one hamza, adhhabtum, or with two hamzas 
[as an interrogative], a-adhhabtum, ‘have you sqaundered ...?’; or with one hamza, adhhabtum, or with 
an initial long ‘a’, adhhabtum, with both of these [pronounced fully] or without pronouncing the second 
[hamza]) your good things during your life of the world, by preoccupying yourselves with sensual de¬ 
lights, and enjoyed them. So today you will be requited with the chastisement of humiliation in return 
for aiding arrogantly in the earth without right and in return for that regarding which you used to aid 
immorally’, and [for] the torture you used to infliCt [upon others] therein.","Everyone will be ranked according to what they did, so that He may recompense them in full for their deeds, and none will be wronged. . On the Day when the disbelievers will be brought to the Fire, [they will be told], “You have exhausted your share of pleasures in the life of the world, and you have enjoyed them. Today you will be recompensed with a disgracing punishment for your arrogance in the land without any right and for your rebellion.",
46,21,25,"And mention the brother of c Ad, namely, Hud, peace be upon him, when ( idh ... [from here] to 
the end [of the verse] constitutes an inclusive substitution) he warned his people, he threatened them, 
at Ahqaf [‘the Sand dunes’ is the name of] a valley in Yemen, where their dwellings were located — and 
already warners, messengers, had passed away before him and after him, that is to say, before Hud 
[came to them] and after him, to their peoples — saying, ‘Do not worship anyone but God (the State¬ 
ment [beginning with] wa-qad khalat, ‘and already [warners] had passed away’, is a parenthetical one). 
Truly I fear for you — should you worship other than God — the chastisement of a dreadful day’. They said, ‘Have you come to divert us from our gods?, to turn us away from worship of them. 
Then bring us what you threaten us with, of chastisement for worshipping them, if you are of the truth¬ 
ful’, in [saying] that it will befall us. He, Hud, said, ‘The knowledge is with God only. He is the One Who knows when chastisement 
will befall you, and I am [merely] conveying to you what I have been sent with, to you. But I see that 
you are an ignorant lot’, given your hastening on of the chastisement. Then, when they saw it, that is, [when they saw] what chastisement [really] was, as a sudden 
cloud, a cloud that appeared [out of nowhere] on the horizon, heading towards their valleys, they said, 
‘This is a cloud that will bring us rain!’. God, exalted be He, says: Nay, but it is what you sought to 
hasten, of the chastisement — a hurricane ( rihun substitutes for rnd, ‘what’) containing a painful chas¬ 
tisement, destroying, ruining, everything, it passes through, by the command of its Lord, by His will, that 
is to say, [destroying] everything that He wants to destroy with it. And so it destroyed their men, women, 
children and properties by flinging them up into the air high above the ground and tearing them to 
pieces. Only Hud and those who believed with him remained [unscathed]. So they became such that 
nothing could be seen except their dwellings. Thus, in the way that We requited them, do We requite

guilty folk, besides them.","Remember [Hūd][8] the brother of ‘Ād, when he warned his people in the [land of] sand dunes[9] – and indeed there came warners before him and after him – [saying], “Worship none but Allah. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a horrible day.” . They said, “Have you come to turn us away from our gods? Then bring us what you are threatening us with, if you are truthful.” . He said, “The knowledge [of its coming] is with Allah alone. I only convey to you the message that I have been sent with, but I see that you are an ignorant people.” . When they saw it as a cloud approaching their valleys, they said, “This is a cloud bringing us rain.” [Hūd said,] No, it is what you sought to hasten[10] – a wind bearing a painful punishment. . It will destroy everything by the command of its Lord. And they became such that there was nothing left visible except [ruins of] their dwellings. This is how We recompense the wicked people.","[8] i.e., Prophet Hūd.
 [9] The people of ‘Ād were the inhabitants of the sand dunes (sand hills) in the southern part of Arabia. . [10] When you challenged me by saying, “Then bring us what you are threatening us with”. (See 46:22 of this chapter)."
46,26,28,"And verily We had empowered them in ways in which We have not (in is either for negation or 
extra) empowered you, O people of Mecca, in the way of strength and means, and We had vetted them 
with ears and eyes and hearts. But their ears and their eyes and their hearts did not avail them in any 
way (min shay’in : min is extra) since ( idh, is operated by aghnd, ‘avail’, and imbued with the sense of [a 
particle introducing a] reason) they used to deny the signs of God, His clear proofs, and they were be¬ 
sieged by, there befell them, what they used to deride, of chastisement. And We certainly destroyed the towns [ that were] around you, that is, [We destroyed] their in¬ 
habitants, the likes of Thamud, ‘Ad and the people of Lot, and We dispensed the signs, We repeated the 
clear proofs, so that perhaps they might return. So why did they not help them, by averting from them the chastisement, those whom they had 
chosen besides God, that is to say, other than Him, as [a means of] nearness, through whom they may 
secure nearness to God, to be gods?, alongside Him, and these are the idols (the firSt objecft of ittakhadhu, 
‘they had chosen, is the omitted pronoun referred to by the relative clause [alladhina, ‘those who ...’], 
and it is hum, ‘they’; qurbdnan, ‘nearness’, is the second [objecft], with alihatan, ‘gods’, as its substitution). 
Nay, but they forsook them, when the chastisement came down [on them], and that, that is to say, [that] 
choosing of theirs of idols as gods as a means of nearness [to God], was their lie and what they used 
to invent — the lies they used to SJieak (rrid, ‘what’, either relates to the verbal acftion [‘their lying’], or it 
indicates a relative clause with the referential pronoun omitted, this being fihi, ‘about’).","We had given them the power to an extent that We have not given you [O Makkans], and We gave them[11] hearing, sight, and hearts. But neither their hearing, nor their sight, nor their hearts availed them in the least, for they used to reject the signs of Allah. And they were overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule. . We have certainly destroyed some towns around you and had given them numerous signs, so that they might return [from disbelief]. . Why is it that they were not helped by those [idols] whom they took as gods besides Allah so that they might bring them closer to Him[12]? Rather, they were lost from them. Such was [the outcome of] their falsehood and the lies they used to fabricate.","[11] i.e., the people of Prophet Hūd. . [12] As they used to claim."
46,29,32,"And, mention, when We sent a company of jinn your way — the jinn of Nasibin in Yemen, 2 or 
the jinn of Nineveh, who were seven or nine, [and this was] while the Prophet (s) was leading the dawn 
prayer with some of his Companions at Batn Nakhla, as reported by the two Shaykhs [al-Bukharl and 
Muslim] — to listen to the Qur’an and, when they were in its presence, they said, that is, they said 
to one another: ‘Listen carefully!’, concentrate in order to hear it [carefully]. Then, when it was fin¬ 
ished, [when] he was finished reciting it, they went back to their people to warn [them], to threaten 
their people with the chastisement [from God] if they do not believe — they had been Jews, but then 
become Muslims. They said, ‘O our people! Indeed we have heard a Book, namely, the Qur’an, which has been 
revealed after Moses, confirming what was before it, what preceded it, such as the Torah. It guides to the 
truth, submission [to God] (islam), and to a Straight way, that is, the way thereto [to Islam]. O our people! Respond to God’s summoner, Muhammad (s), by embracing faith, and believe in 
him, and He, God, will forgive you some of your sins, because some of these [sins] are wrongs [done to 
others] and which [therefore] can only be forgiven after those wronged are reconciled — and shelter you 
from a painful chastisement. And whoever does not respond to God’s summoner cannot thwart God on earth, that is to say, 
he will not be able to thwart God by escaping from Him and eluding Him, and he, the one who does not 
respond, will not have, besides Him, that is, [besides] God, any protestors, any helpers to ward off the 
chastisement from him — those, who do not respond, are in manifest error’, plain and evident [error].","And [remember] when We sent to you a group of jinn to listen to the Qur’an. When they heard it, they said [to one another], “Listen attentively.” Then when it was over, they returned to their people as warners. . They said, “O our people, we have heard a scripture that has been sent down after Moses, confirming what came before it; it guides to the truth and to a straight path. . O our people, respond to the one[13] who is calling to Allah, and believe in him; He will forgive some of your sins and protect you from a painful punishment. . And whoever does not respond to the one who is calling to Allah will have no escape on earth, nor will he have any protectors against Him; such people are clearly misguided.”","[13] i.e., Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)."

■will say, ‘Then taSte the chastisement for what you used to disbelieve [in]’. So endure [with patience], the harm done [to you] by your people, juSt as the resolute, those 
of constancy and [power of] endurance during hardships, from among the messengers endured [with 
patience], before you, so that you may be one of resolve [like them] ( min [of mina’l-rusuli] is explicative, 
as all of them were men of resolve; but some say that this [particle min\ is [actually] meant to be partitive, 
since excluded from their number are: Adam, on the basis of Gods saying, exalted be He: And We did not 
find in him any constancy [Q. 20:115]; and Jonah, on the basis of His words: And do not be like the One 
of the fish [Q. 68:48]). And do not seek to hasten [it] for them, for your people, the sending down of the 
chastisement on them. Some say that he [the Prophet] seemed [by this Stage] to have become exasper¬ 
ated because of them and desired that chastisement be sent down on them, which is why he was enjoined 
to [exercise] patience and to refrain from hastening the chastisement [for them] — for it would befall 
them [eventually] without doubt. It shall seem for them, on the day when they see what they are prom¬ 
ised, of chastisement in the Hereafter, given its long duration, as though they had tarried, in this world, 
by their reckoning, only an hour of a day. This Qur’an is, a communication, a proclamation from God 
to you. So shall any be destroyed, that is to say, none [shall be destroyed] upon seeing the chastisement, 
but the immoral folk?, that is to say, the disbelieving [folk].

[47] Muhammad 


Medinese, except for verse 13, or [it is all] Meccan; it consists of 38 or 39 verses. 1 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","Do they not see that Allah, Who created the heavens and earth, and was not wearied by creating them[14], is able to bring the dead to life? Yes indeed! He is the Most Capable of all things. . On the Day when the disbelievers are exposed to the Fire, [they will be asked], “Is this not the truth?” They will say, “Yes indeed, by our Lord.” He will say, “Then taste the punishment for your disbelief.” . So be patient, as the Messengers of Firm Resolve[15] were patient, and do not seek to hasten [punishment] for them. On the Day when they see what they were warned of, it will be as if they had only stayed [in this world] for an hour of a day[16]. This is a warning. Will anyone be destroyed except the rebellious people?","[14] Or did not fail in creating them. . [15] They are Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon them all).
 [16] i.e., for a short period of time."
47,1,6,"Those who disbelieve, from among the people of Mecca, and bar, others ,from the way of God, 
that is to say, [from] faith. He will leave their works to waSte, such as giving food [to the poor] or being 
kind to kin, and so they will find no reward for these [works of theirs] in the Hereafter; [but] they are 
requited for them in this world [purely] out of His bounty, exalted be He. But those who believe, namely, the Helpers ( al-Ansdr ) and others [like them], and perform right¬ 
eous deeds and believe in what has been revealed to Muhammad, namely, the Qur’an — and it is the 
truth from their Lord — He will absolve them of. He will forgive them, their misdeeds and rightly dis¬ 
pose their mind, their ftate, so that they do not disobey Him. That, rendering void of their works and the absolution of evil deeds, is because those who dis¬ 
believe follow falsehood, Satan, and because those who believe follow the truth, the Qur’an, from their 
Lord. Thus, in the same manner of clarification, does God Strike for mankind similitudes of themselves, 
[that is how] He clarifies for them their states, in other words, the disbeliever has his work rendered void 
while the believer is forgiven. So whenyou encounter [in battle] those who disbelieve, then [attack them with] a Striking of the 
necks (fa-darba’l-riqabi is a verbal noun in place of the [full] verbal con£trucftion, that is to say, fa’dribu 
riqabahum, ‘then strike their necks’), in other words, slay them — reference is made to the ‘Striking of 
the necks’ because the predominant cause of being slayed is to be struck in the neck. Then, when you 
have made thoroughly decimated them, bind, 4?are them, take them captive and bind firmly, the bonds 
( al-wathaq is what is used to bind [ yuthaqu ] a captive). Thereafter either [set them free] by grace ( man- 
nan is a verbal noun in place of the [full] verbal con£trucftion), that is to say, either show them grace by 
setting them free unconditionally; or by ransom, ransoming them with payment or with Muslim cap¬ 
tives, until the war, that is to say, its participants, lay down its burdens, its heavy loads of weaponry and 
other things, so that either the disbelievers surrender or enter into a treaty. This [la£t clause] constitutes 
the ‘purpose’ of [enjoining the Muslims to] slaying and taking captive. So [shall it be] ( dhalika is the 
predicate of an implied subject, [such as] al-amr, ‘the ordinance’, in other words, ‘the ordinance [of God] 
regarding them is as mentioned’). And had God willed, He could have [Himself] taken vengeance on 
them, without any fighting, but. He has commanded you to [do] it, that He may teSl some of you by 
means of others, from among them, by way of battle, so that the slain among you will end up in Paradise, 
while those [slain] among them [will end up] in the Fire. And those who are slain (qutilu: a variant read¬ 
ing has qatalu, ‘those who fight’) — this verse was revealed on the day of [the battle of] Uhud, after the 
dead and the wounded had become numerous among the Muslims — in the way of God, He will not let 
their works go to waSte, He will [not] render [them] void. He will guide them, in this world and in the Hereafter to what benefits them, and rightly dispose 
their minds, their condition in both, with that [guidance and disposal] in this world being for those who 
were not slain, but who have been included in [the statement] ‘and those who were slain’ ( qutilu ) because 
of [the] predominance therein [of those who were slain]. And He will admit them into Paradise, which He has made known, [which] He has pointed out, 
to them, so that they are guided to their dwellings in it, and to their Rouses and servants without asking 
to be shown the way.","Those who disbelieve and prevent others from Allah’s way, He will render their deeds void. . As for those who believe, do righteous deeds, and believe in what has been sent down to Muhammad – which is the truth from their Lord – He will absolve them of their sins and set their condition right. . That is because the disbelievers follow falsehood, whereas the believers follow the truth from their Lord. This is how Allah explains to people their comparisons[1]. . When you encounter the disbelievers [in battle], strike [their] necks until you have thoroughly subdued them, then bind the captives firmly[2]. Later [you may free them] as a favor[3] or for ransom until the war comes to an end[4]. That [is Our command], if Allah had willed, He could have subjected them to punishment, but [He ordered you to fight] to test some of you by means of others. Those who are killed in the way of Allah, He will never render their deeds void. . He will guide them, and will set their condition right, . and He will admit them to Paradise, which He has already made known to them[5].","[1] So that each party may know the outcome of its choice. .

ject, the predicate of which is [an implicit] ta’isu, ‘they shall be wretched’, as indicated [by what follows]) 
wretchedness shall be their lot, that is, destruction and defeat from God. And He will make their works 
go to wafte ( wa-adalla a’malahum is a supplement to [the implied] ta’isu, ‘they shall be wretched’). That, wretchedness and waiting [of their works], is because they are averse to what God has 
revealed, of the Qur’an with all that it includes of religious obligations ( takalif ), so He has made their 
works fail. Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for those who were be¬ 
fore them? God destroyed them — He destroyed them, their children and their possessions; and [a fate] 
the like thereof will be for the disbelievers, that is to say, the like of the fate of those before them. That, granting of vicftory to the believers and the vanquishing of the disbelievers, is because God 
is Patron, Ally and Helper, of those who believe and because the disbelievers have no patron.","O you who believe, if you stand up for Allah, He will help you and make your steps firm[6]. . As for those who disbelieve, how wretched will be their state! And He will render their deeds void. . That is because they detest what Allah has sent down, so He rendered their deeds worthless. . Have they not traveled through the land to see what was the end of those before them? Allah destroyed them utterly[7], and a similar end awaits the disbelievers. . That is because Allah is the Protector of the believers whereas the disbelievers have no protector.","[6] i.e., if you stand up for Allah’s cause, His religion, and for His Prophet with your life and wealth, He will make your feet firm on the battlefield and grant you victory. . [7] i.e., Allah destroyed them and all their belongings of wealth, property, and offspring."
47,12,15,"God will surely admit those who believe and perform righteous deeds into gardens underneath 
which rivers flow. As for those who disbelieve, they take their enjoyment, in this world, and eat as the 
cattle eat, that is to say, they are only concerned with [filling] their bellies and [satisfying] their private 
parts, without giving any thought to the Hereafter; and the Fire will be their habitation, their home, 
their station and their [final] destination. And how many (ka-ayyin means kam) a town, by which is meant the inhabitants thereof, might¬

believers, like those whose evil deeds have been adorned for them, so that they see them as fair [deeds], 
and these are the disbelievers of Mecca, and who follow their desires?, by worshipping graven images. In 
other words, there is no similarity between the two. A similitude, a description, of the Garden promised to the God-fearing: [the Garden] that is 
shared equally by all those who enter it (this firSt clause is the subject, of which the predicate [follows:]) 
therein are rivers of unitaling water (read asin or asin, similar [in form] to darib, ‘Striker’, and hadhir, 
‘cautious’), that is to say, one that does not change, in contrast to the water of this world, which may 
change due to some facftor; and rivers of milk unchanging in flavour, in contrast to the milk of this 
world, on account of its issuing from udders, and rivers of wine delicious to the drinkers, in contrast 
to the wine of this world, which is diStaSteful to drink; and [also] rivers of purified honey, in contrast 
to the honey of this world, which when it issues out of the bellies of bees becomes mixed with wax and 
other elements; and there will be for them therein, varieties [of], every fruit and forgiveness from their 
Lord, for He is pleased with them, in addition to His beneficence towards them in the way mentioned, in 
contrast to one who is a maSter of servants in this world, who while being kind to them may at the same 
time be wrathful with them. [Is such a one] like him who abides in the Fire? ( ka-man huwa khalidun 
fi’l-nari, the predicate of an implied subjedt, which is a-man huwafi hadha’l-na’im, ‘Is one who is amidSt 
such bliss [as him who abides in the Fire]?’). And they will be given to drink boiling water which rips 
apart their bowels, that is, their entrails, so that these will be excreted from their rears. ( Am’a, ‘bowels’, 
is the plural of mi’an, its alif being derived from theya’of their saying mi’yan [as an alternative singular 
to mi'an]).","Allah will surely admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to gardens under which rivers flow. As for those who disbelieve, they enjoy themselves [in this world] and they eat as cattle eat[8]; their final abode is the Fire. . How many towns We destroyed that were more powerful than your town that expelled you, and there was none to help them! . Are those who possess clear proof from their Lord like those whose evil deeds are made appealing to them and who follow their own desires? . The likeness of Paradise promised to the righteous is that of a [garden which has] rivers of fresh water[9]; rivers of milk the taste of which never changes; rivers of wine delicious to drink; and rivers of pure honey. They will have therein all kinds of fruit and forgiveness from their Lord. Can they be like those who will abide in the Fire forever, and will be given boiling water to drink that tears apart their intestines?","[8] The disbelievers enjoy their life while they are oblivious of their consequences in the Hereafter, just like the cattle that graze in the pasture not knowing that they will probably be slaughtered soon. .

Sura Muhammad 


such as [ ! Abd Allah] Ibn Mas'ud and [‘Abd Allah] Ibn ‘Abbas, in derision and mockery: ‘What was he 
saying juft now?’ (read anifan or anifan, meaning al-saa, ‘just now’). In other words, [they mean to say] 
‘we will not go back to [listen to] him again’. Those are the ones on whose hearts God has set a seal, of 
disbelief, and who follow their own desires, in [acfting with] hypocrisy. But those who are [rightly] guided, namely, the believers, He, God, enhances their guidance and 
invefts them with fear [ of Him ], He inspires them to [do] that by which they can be wary of [ending up 
in] the Fire. Do they, then, await, they do not await, namely, the disbelievers of Mecca, anything except that 
the Hour should come upon them (an ta’tiyahum is an inclusive substitution for al-saata, ‘the Hour’; in 
other words, it cannot be other than that it will come upon them [...]) suddenly? For already its por¬ 
tents, the signs thereof, have come, among which are the sending of the Prophet (s), the Splitting of the 
Moon [Q. 54:1] and the Smoke [Q. 44:10]. So, when it, the Hour, has come upon them, for what [benefit] 
will their reminder be?, their remembering; in other words, it will be of no benefit to them. Know, then, that there is no god except God, that is to say, adhere, O Muhammad (s), to knowl¬ 
edge of this [facft] that will benefit you at the Resurrection, and ask forgiveness for your sin — this was 
said to him, deSJiite his infallibility (' isma ), so that his community might emulate him [in this reSJied:]. 
Indeed he did do this. The Prophet (s) said, ‘Verily I do ask God for forgiveness a hundred times every 
day’ — and for the believing men and believing women — herein is an honouring for them, by having 
their Prophet enjoined to ask forgiveness for them. And God knows your going to and fro, your bustle 
during the day in pursuit of your business, and your place of reft, when you retire to where you sleep at 
night. In other words, He has knowledge of all your states, nothing of which can be hidden from Him, so 
be mindful of Him — the address [in this verse] is meant for believers as well as others.","Among these [hypocrites] are some who listen to you [O Prophet], but when they leave your presence, they say to those who were given knowledge[10], “What did he just say[11]?” It is they whose hearts Allah has sealed up and who follow their desires. . As for those who follow guidance, He increases them in guidance and blesses them with righteousness[12]. . Are they but waiting for the Hour to come upon them by surprise? Already [some of] its signs have appeared[13]. What good will it do them to take heed when it actually befalls them? . Then know [O Prophet] that none has the right to be worshiped except Allah, and seek forgiveness for your sins[14] and for the [the sins of] the believing men and women, for Allah knows your movements and your places of rest.","[10] From among the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ).
 [11] In an ignoring and indifferent manner. . [12] Taqwā: It means piety, fear and consciousness of Allah, and care to avoid displeasing Him. . [13] Such as the coming of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), and the splitting of the moon after the pagans of Makkah challenged the Prophet (ﷺ) which was fulfilled before their eyes, yet they denied that miracle. . [14] See footnote 40:55. Since the Prophet (ﷺ) is urged to seek forgiveness, the believers are far greater in need of seeking Allah’s forgiveness."
47,20,24,"And those who believe say, seeking to take part in the struggle: ‘Why has a sura not been re¬ 
vealed?’, [one] in which there is mention of the [command to participate in the] struggle. But when a 
definitive sura is revealed, one in which nothing is abrogated ( naskh ), and fighting, that is to say, re¬ 
quirement for it, is mentioned in it, you see those in whose hearts is a sickness, that is, doubt — and they 
are the hypocrites — looking at you with the look of someone fainting at [ the point of] death, because of 
[their] fear of it and [their] aversion to it; in other words, they fear fighting and are averse to it. Yet more 
fitting for them (fa-awla lahum is a subject, the predicate of which [is the following, taatun wa-qawlun 
ma’rufun ]) 2 would be [to offer] obedience and honourable words, that is, [words] that are kind to you. Then, 
when the matter has been resolved upon, that is to say, [when] fighting has been prescribed, if they are 
loyal to God, in faith and obedience, it will be better for them (the sentence beginning with law, ‘if’, 
constitutes the response to idha, ‘when’). May it not be [the case] with you, (read ‘asitum or ‘asaytum; there is a shift here from the third 
person to the second person address), that if you were to turn away, [if] you were to shun faith, you 
would then cause corruption in the land and sever your kinship ties?, in other words, [that] you would 
then return to the ways of pagandom such as belligerence and fighting. Those, that is, the agents of corruption, are the ones whom God has cursed, so made them deaf, 
to hearing the truth, and blinded their eyes, to the path of guidance. Do they not contemplate the Qur’an?, and so recognise the truth. Or (am here is like bal, ‘nay, 
but’) is it that there are locks on, their, hearts?, so they are unable to comprehend it.","Those who believe say, “If only a Chapter were sent down [about fighting]? But when a precise Chapter is sent down and fighting[15] is mentioned therein, you see those in whose hearts is sickness looking at you like someone who is about to die. It would have been better for them[16] . to obey and say good words. Once the fighting was ordained, it would be better for them to be truthful to Allah. . Then if you turn away[17], what else can be expected but that you will spread corruption in the land and sever your ties of kinship[18]? . These are the ones whom Allah has cursed and has made them deaf and blinded their sight. . Do they not reflect upon the Qur’an, or are there locks upon their hearts?","[15] The believers longed for a Qur’anic revelation that would give them permission to fight their enemies.
 [16] It could also mean “Woe to them!” if disconnected from the next verse. . [17] From Islam or from struggling in the way of Allah.
 [18] As you used to do in the pre-Islamic period of ignorance."

2 This is a less frequent way of reading the verse, as most commentators (including Tabari and Baydawi) understand aw Id lahum 
as a variation on waylun lahum, ‘woe to them’, denoting God’s threat to them. This was clearly brought about by the division of the 
text (not uncommon in the Qur’an) where the subject and predicate are separated by the verse division; for otherwise, it would 
have been more natural to read it simply as it Stands awld, ‘more appropriate’ or ‘more worthy’ or ‘better’.

clear to them, Satan has seduced, he has adorned [disbelief for], them and has given them [false] hopes 
(read wa-umliya lahum, ‘[false] hopes have been given to them’, or wa-amla lahum, where the one who 
gives the [false] hopes is Satan, [but only] by God’s will, exalted be He, for he [Satan] is the one who leads 
them astray). That, leading of them astray, is because they said to those who were averse to what God 
revealed, namely, to the idolaters: ‘We will obey you in some matters’, that is to say, by cooperating 
to maintain enmity against the Prophet (s) and preventing people from participating in the struggle 
alongside him: they had said as much secretly, but God, exalted be He, exposed it; and God knows 
their secrets (read asrarahum, as the plural of sirr, ‘a secret’, or israrahum, ‘their keeping [of things] 
secret’, as the verbal noun). Then how will it be, their predicament, when the angels take them away, beating (yadribuna is a 
circumstantial qualifier referring to the angels) their faces and their backs?, with hooked iron rods. That, taking of them away in the State mentioned, is because they followed what angers God, 
and [because] they were averse to what pleases Him, that is to say, [they were averse to] doing what 
pleases Him. Therefore He has made their works fail. Or did those in whose hearts is a sickness suppose that God woidd not expose their rancour?, 
[that] He would [not] bring to light their SJhte againSt the Prophet (s) and the believers.","Indeed, those who turn back [to disbelief] after guidance had become clear to them, it is Satan who has tempted them and deceived them with false hopes of a long life. . That is because they say to those[19] who hate what Allah has sent down, “We will obey you in some matters[20].” But Allah knows their secret schemes. . How will they feel when the angels take their souls, striking their faces and their backs? . That is because they follow what incurs Allah’s wrath and they hate what pleases Him, so He will render their deeds worthless. . Do those in whose hearts is sickness think that Allah will never expose their malice?","[19] i.e., the Jews of Madīnah.
 [20] i.e., your hostility to the Prophet (ﷺ) and hindering people from participation in Jihad."

repeated in [the following, fa-la-’araftahum]), then you would recognise them by their mark. And you 
will certainly recognise them ( wa-la-ta‘rifannahum: the waw is for an omitted oath, and what follows it

senger, opposing him, after the guidance (this is the meaning of ‘the way of God’) has become clear to 
them, they will not hurt God in any way, and He will make their works fail. He will invalidate them, 
[good works] such as voluntary alms and the like, and so they will not find any reward for it in the 
Hereafter — this was revealed either regarding those [Meccan] participants at [the battle of] Badr who 
provided food [for the needy], or regarding [the Jewish tribes of] Qurayza and al-Nadlr.","If We willed, We could show them to you [O Prophet], so you would recognize them by their faces, but you will surely recognize them by the manner of their speech. And Allah knows all what you do. . We will certainly test you so as to reveal those of you who struggle [in Allah’s way] and remain patient, and We will test the sincerity of your assertions. . Those who disbelieve and prevent others from Allah’s way, and oppose the Messenger after guidance had become clear to them, they will never harm Allah in the least, and He will render their deeds worthless.",
47,33,38,"Oyou who believe! Obey God and obey the Messenger, and do not render your own works void, 
by [engaging in] acfts of disobedience, for example. Indeed those who disbelieve and bar from the way of God, His path, namely, guidance, and 
then die as disbelievers, God will never forgive them — this was revealed regarding the men of the 
Well ( al-qalib).' 

3 In other words, ‘He will assuredly try you’, ‘[until] He knows’, and ‘He will appraise’, or ‘We will assuredly try you’, ‘[until] We 
know’, and ‘We will appraise’. 

4 The term qalib means bi’r, ‘well’. Here it refers specifically to a well near the site of the battle of Badr into which, at the Prophet’s 
command, the dead from among the Meccan idolaters were thrown. The Prophet is said to have ftood over the well and addressed 
them with the reproachful words (intended for the inhabitants of Hell) of Q. 7:44, ‘Did you find what your Lord promised to be true 
...?’ The incident is remembered primarily because some of the Muslims present asked the Prophet, ‘Why do you address a people 
who are now nothing more than rotting carcasses?’, to which the Prophet replied, ‘They are no less able to hear me than you; but 
they cannot respond!’; see Ibn Kathir, Bidaya, in, 53fF.

Sura Muhammad 


[47 : 35] So do not falter, [do not] be weak, and [do not] call for peace (read salm or silm), that is to say, 
a truce with the disbelievers should you encounter them, when you have the upper hand (al-alawna : 
the third letter of the triliteral root, wdw, has been omitted), [when you are] the vidtors, the vanquishers, 
and God is with you, helping and assisting, and He will not Hint you, diminish you, in [the reward for] 
your works, that is to say, of the reward for them.  The life of this world, that is to say, preoccupation [solely] with it, is merely play and diversion; 
but if you believe and are wary, of God, [both of] which pertain to [the goal of] the Hereafter, He will 
give you your rewards, and will not ask you your wealth [in return], all of it, rather, only the alms that 
are required from it. 

[ 47 : 37 ] If He were to ask you for it, and press you, demand it persistently, you woidd be niggardly, and 
this, niggardliness, woidd expose your rancour, towards the religion of Islam.  Lo! there you are, O, those who are being called to expend in the way of God, that which has 
been prescribed for you; yet among you there are those who are niggardly; and whoever is niggardly 
is niggardly only to his own soul (one may say bakhila ‘alayhi or [bakhila] ‘anhu [to mean, ‘he was nig¬ 
gardly to someone]). For God is the Independent One, [without need] of your expending; while you 
are the needy, of Him. And if you turn away, from obedience to Him, He will replace you with another 
people, that is to say, He will bring them in your place, and they will not be the likes of you, in turning 
away from obedience to Him, but [they will be] obedient to Him, Mighty and MajeStic [is He].

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","O you who believe, obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and do not cause your deeds to be nullified. . Those who disbelieve and prevent others from Allah’s way, and then die as disbelievers, Allah will never forgive them. . Do not lose heart or call for peace, for you will have the upper hand and Allah is with you. And He will never detract [the reward of] your deeds. . The life of this world is only play and amusement.

Ibn Mas‘ūd said, ""You [people] consider the conquest to be that of Makkah, but we consider it to be the Treaty of al-Hudaybiyyah."" Al-Barā’ bin ‘Āzib said something similar to this as reported by Al-Bukhāri. Although the companions initially regarded this treaty as a setback, yet in effect, it helped promote the spread of Islam, as thousands of people from different tribes accepted Islam during that truce. This treaty was in fact a precursor to the conquest of Makkah two years later. . [2] i.e., sins before this conquest and sins after it. See footnote 40:55, 47:19."

1 In other words, the forgiving of the Prophet’s sins will be a result of the conquest of Mecca, but it did not constitute the reason why 
the conquest of Mecca was ordained for him. As for the lam being an indicator of‘ultimate reason (or purpose), this is mentioned 
because many commentators pose the question (dialedically) of how the conquest of Mecca can be the reason for the Prophets 
being forgiven his sins. Various answers are given (cf. Fakhr al-Din al-Razi on this verse, and Zamakhsharl), of which the following 
maybe mentioned: the conquest involves jihad againSt idolaters, an action which entails expiation of sins and reward; forgiveness 
is merely one of several effects of the conquest, the others being those mentioned by the remainder of the verse and the next (the 
perfection of the favour, guidance to the right path and the mighty victory) — which in itself explains the author’s final gloss, 
namely, that the forgiveness of sin is a result of the conquest and not the reason for (or cause of) it.

48,10,13,"Truly those who pledge allegiance to you, the ‘Pledge of Beatitude’ ( bay’at al-ridwan ) given at 
al-Hudaybiyya, 3 in fad pledge allegiance to God — this [Statement] is akin to: Whoever obeys the Mes¬ 
senger, verily obeys God [Q. 4:80]. The Hand of God is above their hands, [the hands] with which they 
pledged allegiance to the Prophet, in other words, God, exalted be He, has observed their pledge of al¬ 
legiance and will requite them in accordance with [their adherence to] it. So whoever reneges, [whoever] 
breaches the pledge, reneges — [that is] the evil consequences of his breach will eventually be — againSt 
his own soul; and whoever fulfils the covenant which he has made with God, He will give him (fa-sa- 
yu’tihi; or read fa-sa-nutihi, ‘We will give him’) a great reward. Those of the Bedouins who were left behind, around Medina — that is to say, those whom God 
made to stay behind and not to accompany you when you had asked them to set out with you for Mecca, 
fearing that Quraysh would attack you upon your return, in the year of al-Hudaybiyya — will say to 
you, ‘Our possessions and our families kept us occupied, [preventing us] from going forth with you. So 
ask forgiveness for us!’, of God, for our failure to go forth with you. God, exalted be He, exposes their 
mendacity by saying: They say with their tongues, that is to say, in asking forgiveness, and in the preced¬ 
ing statement [of theirs], what is not in their hearts, and so they are lying in the excuse which they give. 
Say: ‘Who can (an interrogative meant [rhetorically] as a negation, that is to say, ‘none [can]’) avail you 
anything againd God should He desire to cause you harm (read darran or durran ) or desire to bring 
you benefit? Nay, but God is ever Aware of what you do, in other words. He is ever possessed of such 
an attribute. Nay ( bal in both instances marks a transition from one subjed to another), but you thought that 
the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families, and that [ thought] was adorned 
in your hearts, that is to say, [you thought] that they would be annihilated by being slain and would not 
return, and you thought evil thoughts, that [just mentioned], and other things, and you were a ruined 
lot’ ( bur is the plural of bair ), in other words, [a lot to be] destroyed according to God for [having en¬ 
tertained] such [evil] thoughts. And whoever does not believe in God and His Messenger, We have prepared for the disbelievers 
a blaze, a severe fire.","Those who pledge allegiance to you [O Prophet] are indeed pledging allegiance to Allah; Allah’s Hand is over their hands[4]. Whoever breaks his pledge, he only breaks it to his own detriment, but whoever fulfills his covenant with Allah, He will give him a great reward. . Those of the Bedouins who lagged behind will say to you, “We were preoccupied with our wealth and our families, so ask for forgiveness for us.” They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say, “Then who can prevent Allah if He intends to harm or benefit you? Indeed, Allah is All-Aware of what you do. . But you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families ever, and that was made appealing in your hearts. You harbored evil thoughts, for you are a doomed people.” .

of the attributes mentioned. Those, mentioned, who were left behind will say, when you set forth after spoils, namely, the 
spoils of Khaybar, in order to capture them, ‘Let us follow you’, that we might [also] take a share of it. 
They desire, thereby, to change the words of God ( kaldma’Llahi : a variant reading has kalima’Llahi), in 
other words, His promising of the spoils of Khaybar exclusively for those who were at al-Hudaybiyya. 
Say: ‘You shall never follow us! Titus has God said beforehand’, that is, prior to our return. Then they 
will say, ‘Nay, but you are envious of us’, led we might acquire a share of the spoils, and therefore you say 
this [that you say]. Nay, but they never understood, anything of religion, [all] except a few, of them.","To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth.

Those who lagged behind will say when you set out to collect the spoils of war, “Let us follow you.” They wish to change the word of Allah[5]. Say, “You will never follow us; this is what Allah has already decreed.” They will then say, “Rather, you are jealous of us[6].” Rather, they do not understand but a little[7].","[5] Allah promised those of the believers who pledged allegiance at Hudaybiyah that the spoils of war obtained from the Jews of Khaybar be exclusively for them.

allegiance from them that they would fight against Quraysh and not [attempt to] flee from death. And 
He, God, knew what was in their hearts, of sincerity and loyalty, so He sent down the Spirit of Peace 
upon them, and rewarded them with a near victory, which was the conquest of Khaybar, following their 
departure from al-Hudaybiyya, and abundant Spoils which they will capture, from Khaybar, and God is ever Mighty, Wise, that 
is to say. He is ever possessed of such attributes. God has promised you abundant Spoils which you will capture, through the [various] conquests. 
So He has expedited this one, the Spoils of Khaybar, for you, and withheld men’s hands from you, with 
regard to your families, after you had set off [on the campaign], as the Jews had intended [to plot] against 
them; but God caSt terror into their hearts; so that it, the expedited one ( wa-li-takuna is a supplement

into His mercy whom He will, such as those believers mentioned. Had they been clearly separated, 
[had] they [the believers] been distinguishable from the disbelievers, We would have surely chastised the 
disbelievers among them, of the people of Mecca [immediately] thereat, by permitting you to go ahead

‘zealotry’), namely, their barring of the Prophet and his Companions from [visiting] the Sacred Mosque, 
[but] then God sent down His Spirit of Peace upon His Messenger and the believers, and so they [the 
disbelievers] made a truce with them on the condition that they [the believers] would [be allowed to] 
return the following year, and [such] zealotry would not overcome them [the believers] as it did the dis¬ 
believers [then] until they would come to fight them [later], and He made them, the believers, abide by

it, of the word, than the disbelievers, and deserving of it ( wa-ahlaha is an explanatory supplement). And 
God is ever Knower of all things, that is to say, He is ever possessed of such an attribute, and among the 
things He knows is that they are worthy of it.","It is He Who restrained their hands from you and your hands from them near Makkah[13], after giving you the upper hand over them. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do. . It is they who disbelieved and prevented you from the Sacred Mosque and detained the sacrificial animals[14] from reaching their place of sacrifice. If it had not been for the believing men and women whom you could not identify, you might have trampled over them, thus incurring guilt unknowingly, [We would have let you march to Makkah]. [This was] so that Allah may admit to His mercy whom He wills[15]. If they had been distinct [from the disbelievers], We would surely have inflicted on those who disbelieved among them a painful punishment. . When the disbelievers harbored pride in their hearts – the pride of ignorance[16] – then Allah sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger and upon the believers, and caused them to adhere to the word of piety[17], for they were more deserving and worthy of it. And Allah is All-Knowing of everything.","[13] A group of pagans of Makkah who were around eighty people came to attack the Muslims in Hudaybiyyah on their way to Makkah, but Muslims were able to take them as captives, then released them. . [14] i.e., The Prophet (ﷺ) had brought along with him seventy camels to be sacrificed after completing the rituals of ‘Umrah (the minor pilgrimage).
 [15] Thus, not only the Muslims in Makkah who were not known to their fellow believers were safe, but also those pagans who later embraced Islam were safe too. . [16] This was when the pagans of Makkah prevented the Prophet (ﷺ) and the believers from entering the Sacred House to perform ‘Umrah for fear that Arabs would consider this a shame and insult to the pagans for allowing Muslims to enter Makkah.

He informed his Companions of this and they rejoiced. But when they set off with him [from Medina], 
and the disbelievers impeded them at al-Hudaybiyya such that they had to retreat, which was distressing 
for them, for some of the hypocrites began to have doubts [about the Prophet’s sincerity], this [verse] was 
revealed ( bi’l-haqqi, ‘in all truth’, is semantically connected to sadaqa, ‘fulfilled’, or it is a circumstantial

the truce, what you did not know, in the way of reconciliation [between the believers and the Meccans],

who are with him’]), that is to say, they show mutual sympathy and affecftion for one another, much like 
a father and a son. You see, you observe, them bowing, prostrating [in worship] (both rukka ‘an and suj-

You see them bowing and prostrating [in prayer], seeking Allah’s grace and pleasure. Their distinguishing sign is on their faces from the effects of prostration. Such is their description in the Torah[21]. And their description in the Gospel is like that of a seed that sprouts its shoot, then makes it strong; then it grows thick and stands straight on its stem[22], which delights the sowers – so that He may enrage thereby the disbelievers.

they had come out to meet him, he assumed that they had come to settle old scores and retreated hastily to Medina to inform the 
Prophet that they should attack the tribe before they draw any nearer — whereas they had actually come out in good faith to show 
their commitment to the new religion.

had returned to their homelands, the Prophet (s) sent Khalid [b. al-Walid] to them, who observed only 
obedience and goodness in them and [later] informed the Prophet of this. And know that the Messenger of God is among you, so do not steals falsehood, for God will in¬

contrary to reality, so that the necessary [evil] consequences ensue, you would surely be in trouble, you 
would earn in addition to that sin, the sin for the consequences that ensue [from your error]. But God 
has endeared faith to you, adorning your hearts with it, and He has made odious to you disbelief and 
immorality and disobedience ([an indance of] suppletion with rested to import, as opposed to [lexical]

Wise, in His bedowal of graces on them.","O you who believe, if an evildoer brings you some news, verify it, lest you harm a people unknowingly, then you become regretful for what you did[4]. . Know that the Messenger of Allah is among you. If he were to obey you in many matters, you would surely suffer[5]. But Allah has endeared faith to you and made it pleasing to your hearts, and has made disbelief, wickedness, and disobedience hateful to you. Such are the rightly guided, . by Allah’s grace and favor. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.","[4] The Prophet (ﷺ) sent Al-Walīd ibn ‘Uqbah ibn Abi Mu‘ait to collect zakah (alms-tax) from the tribe of Bani Al-Mustaliq. They went out to receive Al-Walīd but he thought that they wanted to harm him. So, he quickly came back to the Prophet (ﷺ) with the bad news, so he wanted to punish them.

like eating his flesh when he is dead. This latter [form of behaviour] has been suggested to you and you 
were averse to it, so be averse to the former too. And fear God, that is, His punishment for backbiting, 
by repenting of it; assuredly God is Relenting, accepting of the penitence of those who repent, Merciful,

49,14,18,"The Bedouins — a group of men from among the Banu Asad — say, ‘We believe’, we affirm the

Yet if you obey God and His Messenger, by [embracing] faith and in other ways. He will not diminish 
for you (read ya’litkum or yalitkum, by making the hamza an alif) anything of your deeds, that is, of the 
reward for them. God is indeed Forgiving, to believers. Merciful, to them. The [true] believers, that is, those who are true in their [affirmation of] faith — as He makes 
explicit in what follows — are only those who believe in God and His Messenger, and then have not 
doubted, they have not been uncertain of [their] faith, and who strive with their wealth and their souls 
for the cause of God, hence their striving manifests the sincerity of their faith. It is they who are sincere, 
in their faith, not those who say, ‘We believe’, and from whom all that has been forthcoming is their sub¬ 
mission [to the religion]. Say, to them: ‘Do you [pretend to] inform God about your religion (read the doubled [2 nd ver¬ 
bal] form a-tu’allimuna, ‘do you inform’), in other words, are you intimating to Him your [religious] 
status when you say, ‘We believe’, when God knows all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, 
and [even though] God is Knower of all things?’ They deem it to be a favour to you that they have submitted, without [the need for any] fighting, 
unlike [those] others who submitted only after being fought. Say: ‘Do not deem your submission to be 
a favour to me ( isldmakum, ‘your submission, has dependent accusative status because of the omission 
of the genitive preposition hi-,which is also read as implicit before the an in both instances). 4 Rather, it 
is God Who has done you a favour in that He has guided you to faith, if you are being sincere, when 
you say, ‘We believe’. Truly God knows the Unseen of the heavens and the earth, that is, [He knows] all that is hidden 
in both, and God is Seer of what you do’ (may be read either as yamaluna, ‘they do’, or ta’maluna, ‘you 
do’), nothing of which can be concealed from Him.

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","The Bedouins say, “We have believed.” Say, “You have not believed, but say, ‘We have submitted,’ for faith has not yet entered your hearts[8]. But if you obey Allah and His Messenger, He will not detract anything from the reward of your deeds. Indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” . Indeed, the believers are those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, then they do not have doubt, but fight with their wealth and their lives in the way of Allah. It is they who are the truthful. . Say, “Do you inform Allah of your faith, when Allah knows all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth? And Allah is All-Knowing of everything.” . They think that they have done you a favor by embracing Islam. Say, “Do not consider your Islam as a favor to me. Rather, it is Allah Who has done you a favor by guiding you to faith, if you are truthful. . Indeed, Allah knows all that is unseen of the heavens and earth, and Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.”","[8] There is a distinction between Islam and Imān (faith). Imān is a higher degree than Islam. This distinction is mentioned in an authentic Hadīth of the Prophet (ﷺ), known as the Hadīth of Gabriel."
50,1,11,"Qaf God knows beSt what He means by this [letter]. By the glorious Qur’an, [by] the noble 
[Qur’an], the disbelievers of Mecca have [certainly] not believed in Muhammad (s). Nay, but they consider it odd that there should have come to them a Warner from among them¬ 
selves, a messenger who is one of them, to threaten them with [the punishment of] the Fire after resur¬ 
rection. So the disbelievers say, ‘This, warning, is an odd thing! What! (read a-idha pronouncing both hamzas, or not pronouncing the second, but inserting an 
alif between the two in both cases) When we are dead and have become duit?, shall we return [to life]? 
That is afar-fetched return!’, [an event that is] extremely remote. We know what the earth diminishes, consumes, of them, and with Us is a preserving Book, 
namely, the Preserved Tablet ( al-lawh al-mahfuz. ), which contains everything that has been ordained 
[by God]. Nay, but they denied the truth, the Qur’an, when it came to them and so they, with regard to 
the Prophet (s) and the Qur’an, are [now] in a confounded situation, a troubled [one]. [For] on one 
occasion they said [that he was], ‘A sorcerer!’ [cf. Q. 38:4] and [that his statements were] ‘[Nothing 
but manifest] sorcery!’ [cf. Q. 37:15], on another, ‘A poet!’ [cf. Q. 21:5] and ‘Poetry!’ [cf. Q. 36:69], 
and Still on another, ‘A soothsayer!’ [cf. Q. 52:29] and [that his Statements were nothing more than] 
soothsaying [cf. Q. 69:42]. Have they not then looked, with their own eyes, at the heaven, being, above them, in order to 
take heed by their own minds [of the consequences for them] when they deny the Resurrection, how 
We have built it, without supports, and adorned it, with planets, and how there are no cracks in it?, no 
fissures blemishing it. And the earth ( wa’l-arda, is a supplement to the position of the words ila l-samai, ‘at the heaven’), 
how, We have spread it out, [how] We have rolled it across the face of the water, and caft in it firm moun¬ 
tains, to fix it in place, and caused every delightful kind, [every delightful] Specimen, causing delight by 
its [very] beauty, to grow in it, as an insight ( tabsiratan is a direcft object denoting reason, that is to say, We did this to give an 
insight from Us) and a reminder for every penitent servant, who returns to obedience of Us. And We send down from the heaven blessed water, containing much blessing, with which We 
cause to grow gardens, orchards, and the grain that is harvested, and the date-palms that Ttand tall ( bdsiqatin, is an implied [future] circumstantial qualifier) 
with piled fpathes, one [cluster of dates] sitting on top of the other, as provision for [Our] servants (rizqan li’l-ibadi, is a direCt objeCt denoting reason); and with 
it We revive a dead land ( baldatan maybe followed equally by the masculine [ maytan ] or the feminine 
[adjeCtive, maytatan ]). So, like that manner of reviving, shall be the rising, from the graves: so how can

But they wonder that a warner has come to them from among themselves, so the disbelievers say, “This is something strange! . What! Is it when we die and become dust [will we return to life]?

Rather they rejected the truth when it came to them, so they are in a state of confusion[3]. . Have they not then looked at the sky above them – how We built it and adorned it [with stars], and it has no rifts? . And We have spread out the earth and set therein firm mountains, and caused to grow therein plants of every pleasant kind, . as a source of insight and a reminder to every slave who turns [to Allah]. . And We send down from the sky blessed rain, with which We cause to grow gardens and grain for harvest, . and towering palm trees having clustered fruit, . as a provision for people, and We revive thereby a dead land; likewise will be the resurrection.","[1] See footnote 2:1. .

4 Patently, this is the dual form, but because the gloss refers to a singular noun, Malik, the exegetes have understood this as an em¬ 
phatic way of addressing a person with an imperative. Baydawl (in his commentary on this verse) cites a poetic shahid to indicate 
that the Arabs may use the dual as a rhetorically emphatic device for addressing a person. The alternative reading is that the verbal 
form is originally an ‘energetic’ ( modus energicus) but has been transformed: so alqiyanna or alqiyan to alqiyd. 

5 What this means is that the Statement may be read as: ‘he who has set up alongside God another god, caSt him into the severe 
chastisement’. 

6 The Arabic allows for such a paronomaStic gloss: salam denotes ‘peace’, greeting’ and ‘safety’.

but they found none. Assuredly there is in that, which is mentioned, a reminder, an admonition, for him who has a 
heart, a mind, or gives ear, [or] listens to admonitions, in [full] witness, present in heart [and mind]. And verily We created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, in six days, the 
fi rSt of which was Sunday and the la St of which was Friday, and no weariness, no fatigue, touched Us: 
this was revealed as a refutation of the Jews’ claim that God rented on the Saturday and lay down upon 
the Throne. The preclusion of weariness in His case is [absolute] on account of His transcending of the 
attributes of creatures and the non-existence of any contiguity between Him and other [beings]: His com¬ 
mand, when He wills a thing, is juft to say to it 'Be’, and it is [Q. 36:82]. So endure [patiently], addressing the Prophet (s), what they, the Jews and others, say, in the way 
of [anthropomorphic] comparisons and denials, and glorify with praise of your Lord, perform prayers 
with praise [of Him], before the rising of the sun, in other words, [perform] the morning prayer, and 
before the sunset, that is to say, [perform] both the midday and the afternoon prayers; and glorify Him at [some part of the] night, that is to say, perform the two evening prayers, 7 and 
after proftrations (read adbar, as the plural of dubur, or idbar as the verbal noun from adbara, ‘to pass’), 
in other words, perform supererogatory prayers as prescribed by the Sunna after the obligatory ones; it is 
also said to mean the aCtual uttering of glorifications at these times, with continuous praise. And liften — O addressee to My words — on the day when the caller, namely, [the archangel] 
Israfil, calls out from a place that is near, to the heaven: this is the Rock of the Holy House [of Jerusa¬ 
lem], the place on earth that is the nearest to the heaven. He [Israfil] will say: ‘O withered bones, severed 
limbs, torn flesh and scattered hairs! God verily commands you to come together for the passing of 
judgement’. On the day {yawma substitutes for the previous yawma) when they, that is, all creatures, hear 
the Call of truth, of the Resurrection — this will be Israfil’s second blaSt, and it may precede or follow his 
[initial] call — that, day of the call and the hearing, is the day of coming forth, from the graves (yawma, 
‘on the day, is in the accusative because of an implied yunadi, ‘[when] he will call’), that is to say, they will 
come to know the consequence of their denial. Indeed it is We Who give life and bring death, and to Us is the journey’s end. On the day when ( yawma substitutes for the previous yawma, with the intervening [Statement] 
being a parenthetical) the earth is Tplit asunder (read tashaqqaqu, or tashshaqqaqu, where the original 
second ta [of tatashaqqaqu ] has been assimilated with it [the shin]) from them, [they will come] haften- 
ing forth ( siraan: [sira ] the plural of sari', a circumstantial qualifier referring to an implied clause, that 
is to say [together they would read] fa-yakhrujiina musri'ina, ‘they come forth hastening’). That is an 
easy gathering for Us ( dhalika hashrun ‘alaynd yasir. there is here a separation of the noun from its adjec¬ 
tive by what is semantically connected to it, for the purpose of Specification — which is [rhetorically] 
unobjectionable; dhalika, ‘that’, is meant to point out the signification of the ‘gathering’, which itself is 
[also] predicated by this [demonstrative particle], and this signification is the bringing back to life after 
extinction and the assembly for the exposition and the reckoning [before God]). We know be ft what they, the disbelievers of the Quraysh, say, and you are not [to be] a coercerof 
them, so as to coerce them to [embrace] faith — but this was [revealed] before the command to Struggle 
[againSt these disbelievers]. So admonish by the Qur’an those who fear My threat, namely, believers.

Meccan, consisting of 60 verses. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","How many nations We destroyed before these [Makkans] who were stronger than them in might! They sought refuge in the land. Did they find any escape? . Indeed, in that is a reminder for anyone who has a [mindful] heart or lends an attentive ear. . Indeed, We created the heavens and earth and all that is between them in six days, and no weariness touched Us[17]. . So bear patiently [O Prophet] what they say, and glorify the praise of your Lord before sunrise and before sunset[18]. . And glorify Him in the night[19] and after the prayers. . And listen! On the Day when the Caller will call out from a nearby place[20], . the Day when they will hear the Blast [of the second Trumpet] in truth[21]. That is the Day of Resurrection. . Indeed, it is We Who give life and cause death, and to Us is the final return. . On the Day when the earth will be rent asunder for them as they hasten forth [from their graves]; that is an easy gathering for Us. . We know best what they say, and you are not there to compel them to believe. But remind with the Qur’an those who fear My warning.","[17] It is believed that this verse came in response to the Jews who claimed that after the Lord made the heavens and the earth in six days, He rested on the seventh day. See Exodus 31:17. . [18] This and the following verse refer to the times of the five daily prayers; before the sun rises and sets (i.e., the Fajr, Zuhr, and ‘Asr prayers). . [19] The night (the Maghrib, ‘Isha’ prayers). . [20] The angel who will blow the second trumpet for the Resurrection. . [21] See footnote below 50:20."

other things across the lands and to [all] servants, assuredly what you are promised (md , ‘what’, relates to the verbal action), in other words, the

made in the sand, indeed you, O people of Mecca, with regard to the matter of the Prophet (s) and the Qur’an, are of 
differing opinions: some say [of the Prophet that he is] ‘a poet’, ‘a sorcerer’, or ‘a soothsayer’, and [of the 
Qur’an, that it is] ‘poetry’, ‘sorcery’, or ‘soothsaying’. He is turned away therefrom, from the Prophet (s) and the Qur’an, that is, [turned away] from be¬ 
lieving therein, who has deviated, [who has been] turned away from guidance in God’s, exalted be He. Perish the conjedurers, accursedbe the liars, those of differing opinions, who are in a dupor, in ignorance that has stupefied them, heedless, oblivious of the matter of 
the Hereafter. They ask, the Prophet, asking [him] derisively: ‘When is the Day of Judgement?’, in other words, 
‘when will it come?’, and the response [given] to them is that it will come: on the day when they will be tormented in the Fire, that is to say, chastised in it, and it will be 
said to them during the chastisement: ‘Tade this torment of yours, this chastisement of yours. This, chastisement, is what you sought 
to haden on!’, in the world in derision.","By the heaven with its pathways[1], . Indeed, you [Makkans] have conflicting views[2]. . He who is diverted from it is destined to be diverted. .

‘truly’) what their Lord has given them, of reward, for indeed formerly, [before] their entering Paradise, 
they had been virtuous, in the world. Little of the night did they use to sleep (md is extra; yahja’una is the predicate of kdnii; qalilan, 
‘little’, is an adverb), in other words, they used to sleep for a small portion of the night and perform 
prayers during moSt of it, 


Sura al-Dhariyat and at dawns they used to seek forgiveness: they used say, ‘Our Lord! Forgive us’, and there was a share in their wealth [assigned]for the beggar and the deprived, [the latter be¬

signs, indications of Gods power, glory be to Him, exalted be He, and of His Oneness, for those who 
know with certainty, and in your souls, there are also signs, from the beginning of your creation to its end, and in the 
marvelous aSJiedts of your creation. Will you not then perceive?, [all] that and thus infer therefrom the 
Creator of it and His power. And in the heaven is your provision, that is, the rain from which results the vegetation that is 
[your] provision, and [there is also] what you are promised, in the way of [the ultimate] return, reward 
and punishment, in other words, all of this is foreordained in the heaven. So by the Lord of the heaven and the earth, it, that which you are promised, is as assuredly 
true as [the fad] that you have [power of] speech (read mithlu, in the nominative, as an adjedive, 
with the ma being extra; or read mithla, in the accusative, as being a compound with ma), that is to 
say: [it is as true] as your Speech is in reality, that is, in your knowing it to be [true] necessarily by its 
issuing from you.","Indeed, the righteous will be in gardens and springs, . receiving what their Lord will give them, for they were indeed doers of good beforehand. . They used to sleep only a little at night[4], . and before dawn they would seek forgiveness[5], . and in their wealth, there was a share for the beggar and the destitute. . On earth there are signs for those who are certain in faith, . and also within yourselves. Do you not see? . And in the heaven is your provision and all that you are promised. . By the Lord of the heaven and earth, this [resurrection] is certainly as true as the fact that you can speak.","[4] i.e., spending most of the night in prayer, reciting the Qur’an, and in supplication. .

51,24,37,"Has the dory reached you — addressing the Prophet (s) — of Abraham’s honoured gueds? — 
these were [said to be either] twelve, ten or three angels, one of whom was Gabriel. When ( idh is an adverbial qualifier of hadithu dayfi, ‘the dory of the gueds’) they entered upon 
him and said, ‘Peace!’ — in other words [they said] these very words. 1 He said, ‘Peace!’ — [also] these 
very words — [These are] an unfamiliar folk, whom we do not know — he said this to himself ( qawmun 
munkaruna is the predicate of an implicit subjedt such as haulai, ‘these are’). Then he went aside to his family, secretly, and brought a fat calf — in siirat Hud [it is said], a 
roaded calf[ Q. 11:69] — and he placed it near them saying, ‘Will you not eat?’: he invited them to eat, but they did 
not respond. Then he conceived, he kept secret in himself, a fear of them. They said, ‘Do not be afraid!’, we 
are messengers from your Lord. And they gave him good tidings of [ the birth of] a knowledgeable boy, 
one endowed with much knowledge, and this was Isaac, as mentioned in surat Hud [Q. 11:71]. Then his wife, Sarah, came forward clamouring, shouting (fi sarratin is a circumstantial quali¬

unto males in addition to their disbelief. 

[ 5 1: 3 5] So We brought forth those in them, that is, [in] the towns of the people of Lot, who were believ¬ 
ers, in order to destroy the disbelievers;  but We did not find therein other than one house of those who had submitted [to God]: these were 
Lot and his two daughters. They have been described [here] with [the terms] ‘belief’ and ‘submission be¬ 
cause they had affirmed [faith] in their hearts and used their limbs to perform aCts of obedience. And We left therein, after destroying the disbelievers, a sign, an indication of their destruction, 
for those who fear the painful chastisement, so that they may not do what these [sinners] did.","Has there come to you the story of Abraham’s honored guests[6]? . When they came to him and said, “Peace.” He said, “Upon you be peace.” [saying to himself] “Unknown people!” . Then he went quickly to his household, and came with a fat [roasted] calf, . and placed it before them and said, “Will you not eat?” . He felt apprehensive about them[7]. They said, “Do not be afraid,” and gave him glad tidings of a knowledgeable son. . His wife cried out loud, and struck her face [in astonishment] and said, “[I am] a barren old woman!” . They said, “This is what your Lord said. Indeed, He is the All-Wise, the All-Knowing.” . Abraham said, “Then what is your mission, O messengers?” . They said, “We have been sent to a wicked people, . to send down upon them stones of clay, . marked by your Lord for the transgressors.” . We brought out those believers who were there, . but We only found in it one Muslim household[8]. . And We left there a sign[9] for those who fear the painful punishment.","[6] Honorable angels with Allah. . [7] In their culture, if a guest refused to eat the food provided, it was considered a sign of ill will. See footnote 11:70. . [8] Lot's family except his wife. . [9] i.e., the ruins of Sodom or the Dead Sea in Palestine, as a lesson for people."
51,38,46,"And [a sign too] in Moses (wa-fi Musa is a supplement tofiha, ‘therein’), that is to say, We also 
left a sign in the Story of Moses, when We sent him to Pharaoh, veSted, with a clear warrant, with a 
manifest proof; blithe turned away, he rejected belief, to his supports (bi-ruknihi ), his hoSts, [so called] because 
to him they are like a support [rukn], saying, to Moses that he [Moses] was: A sorcerer, or a madman!’ So We seized him and his hoSts and caSt, flung, them into the waters, the sea, and so they 
drowned, for he, that is. Pharaoh, was blameworthy, guilty of what is blameworthy, such as denying the 
messengers and claiming divinity. And [also] in, the destruction of, Ad, was a sign, when We unleashed againSt them a barren 
wind, [a wind] which brings nothing of good, for it does not bear any rain and does not pollinate any 
trees; this [wind] was the weSt wind ( al-dabur ). 

[ 51:42] It did not leave anything, any soul or property, that it came upon without making it like decayed 
bones, like something that is withered and in scattered pieces.  And [also] in, the destruction of, Thantud, was a sign, when it was said to them, after the ham¬ 
stringing of the she-camel, ‘Enjoy [yourselves] for a while!’, until the end of your terms [of life] — as 
Stated in the [other] verse, ‘Enjoy [yourselves] in your dwellings for three days’ [(3.11:65]. Then they defied, they scorned, the command of their Lord, [refraining] from implementing it; 
so the thunderbolt, that is, the destructive cry, seized them, after the three days had passed, as they were 
looking around, in other words, [it seized them] in the daytime. 

[ 51:45] So they were unable to rise up, they could not get up upon the sending down of the chastisement, 
nor were they victors, over the One Who destroyed them.  And the people of Noah (read wa qawmi Nuhin, as a supplement to Thamuda, in other words: ‘in 
the destruction of these [two peoples] by what [destructive power] exists in the heavens and the earth 
there is [also] a sign’; or read wa qawma Nuhin, in other words, ‘We also destroyed the people of Noah’) 
aforetime, that is, before the destruction of those mentioned. Indeed they were an immoral lot.","And [there is a sign in the story of] Moses when We sent him to Pharaoh with compelling proofs, . But he and his supporters turned away, and he said about [Moses], “A magician or a madman!” . So We seized him and his soldiers and cast them into the sea while he was blameworthy[10]. . And [there is a sign in the story of] ‘Ād, when We sent against them the devastating barren wind[11]. . It spared nothing it came upon except that it reduced it to ruin and decay. . And [there is a sign in the story of] Thamūd, when they were told, “Enjoy yourselves for a while[12].” . But they rebelled against the command of their Lord, so the thunderbolt seized them, while they were looking on. . They could not withstand it, nor could they ward it off. . And the people of Noah [were also destroyed] before them. They were indeed a rebellious people.","[10] For his disbelief and arrogance. . [11] Devoid of all goodness such as carrying rain or fertilizing trees. . [12] i.e., only three days. See 11:65."
51,47,51,"And the heaven, We built it with might, and indeed We are powerful (one says ada’l-rajulu or ya’idu, 
to mean, ‘he is Strong’; and awsaa’l-rajulu, to mean, ‘he has become capable [dhu saa] and Strong’). 

[ 51:48] And the earth, We “Spread it out: We made it level: what excellent Spreaders then!. We are.  And of all things ( wa-min kulli shay’in is semantically connected to His [following] words

realise that the Creator of pairs is [Himself] Singular, that you might then worship him. So flee unto God, that is to say, away from His punishment toward His reward by being obedient 
to Him and not disobeying Him. Truly I am a clear Warner to you from Him. And do not set up another god alongside God. Truly I am a clear Warner to you from Him (be- 
for efa-firru, ‘so flee’, one may read an implicit [preceding] qul lahum, ‘Say to them).","We built the heaven with might[13], and We are indeed expanding it. . And We spread out the earth. How well did We smooth it out[14]! . And We have created everything in pairs[15], so that you may take heed. . So flee to Allah[16]. Indeed, I am a clear warner to you from Him. . And do not set up another god with Allah. Indeed, I am a clear warner to you from Him.”","[13] ’Ayd does not mean ""hands"" here. This is not from the verses of Allah's attributes, for Allah Almighty did not add it to Himself, i.e., He did not say, ""My ’ayd, or Our ’ayd"". . [14] The earth was spread out to accommodate the creatures. Its spherical shape is mentioned in 39:5. . [15] Such as day and night, male and female, light and darkness, sweet and bitter, hot and cold, etc. . [16] From His punishment to His reward by shunning disbelief and sin and by obeying Him."
51,52,60,"Thus there did not come to those who were before them any messenger but they said, that he 
was: ‘A sorcerer, or a madman!’, in other words, their denial of you, by saying that you are a sorcerer 
or a madman, was like the denial of communities before them of their messengers by saying that [same 
thing], Have they, all, enjoined this upon one another? (an interrogative intended as a denial). Nay, 
but they are an insolent folk, [a folk] whose own [proclivity to] insolence has made them all say the 
same thing. So shun them, for you will not be reproached, because you have conveyed the Message to them. And remind, admonish by the Qur’an, for reminding truly benefits believers, [these being] those 
whom God knows that they will believe. And I did not create the jinn and mankind except that they may worship Me: the fad that dis¬ 
believers do not worship [God] does not contradid this [Statement], since a purpose does not have to be 
realised [in an ad, for it to be valid], as when you may say: ‘I sharpened this pencil in order to write with 
it’, even though you might not adually write with it. I do not desire from them any provision, [either] for Myself, for themselves, or for others, nor do 
I desire that they should feed Me, or [feed] themselves or others. Indeed it is God Who is the Provider, the Lord of Strength, the Firm, the Stern. And for those who have wronged, their souls through disbelief, from among the people of Mecca 
and others, there will assuredly be a lot, a share of chastisement, like the lot, the share, of their counter¬ 
parts, who perished before them. So let them not ask Me to hasten on, the chastisement, should I give 
them reSJute until the Day of Resurredion. For woe, a terrible chastisement [will come], to those who disbelieve, from, upon, that day of 
theirs which they are promised, that is, the Day of Resurredion.

ject of God’s words fijannatin, amid gardens’) on ranged couches, [arranged] one next to the other, and 
We will wed them (zawwajndhum is a supplement to jannatin, ‘gardens’, meaning ‘We will couple them) 
to beautiful houris, of wide and beautiful eyes. And those who believed (wa’lladhina amanu, the subjecft) and whom We made to be followed 
(wa-atbanahum-. a variant reading has wa’ttabaathum, ‘and there followed them’, as a supplement to 
amanu, ‘who believed’) by their descendants (dhurriyatihim: a variant reading [for this plural] has 
dhurriyatuhum ),' young and old, in faith, on the part of the older ones and on the part of the parents in 
[their] young ones (the predicate [of the subjecft above] is [the following, alhaqna bihim ), We will make 
their, mentioned, descendants join them, in Paradise, so that they are in the same degree [of reward], 
even though they might not have performed the same [meritorious] deeds as them [to deserve this equal 
status], a way of honouring the parents by having their children join them [again]; and We will not de¬ 
prive them (read alatnahum or alitnahum), [We will not] diminish [them], of any thing (min shay’in : min 
is extra) of their deeds, in order to add it to the deeds of their children. Every man is subject to what he 
has earned, of good or evil deeds, and will be requited for evil and rewarded for good. And We will supply them. We will enhance for them [their provision], from time to time, with 
fruits and meat, such as they desire, even if they do not request it openly. They will pass from one to another therein, in Paradise, a cup, [of] wine, wherein is neither vain 
talk, which might come about between them as a result of drinking it, nor cause for sin, thereby, that 
might befall them — in contract to [the case with] the wine of this world. And there will circulate from all around them, for service, youths, delicate [in demeanour], of 
their own, as if, in terms of their beauty and immaculateness, they were hidden pearls, preserved inside 
shells, because when it [a pearl] is inside it, it is better than one that is not. And some among them will turn to one another, questioning each other — they ask one another 
about how they were in the pa£t and what they have now attained, in their delight and acknowledgement 
of the grace [of God to them]. They say, as an intimation of the reason for this attainment: ‘Truly, before, amid our families, in 
the world, we used to be ever anxious, afraid of God’s chastisement; but God showed us favour, through [His] forgiveness, and shielded us from the piercing chas¬ 
tisement (al-samum), the Fire, so called because it penetrates the pores ( al-masamm ); and they say, also 
by way of intimation: indeed before, that is, in the world, we used to call on Him, worship Him, affirming His Oneness. 
Verily He is (read innahu as the beginning of a new [independent] sentence, even if it introduces the 
reason in terms of its import; or read annahu as a reason in terms of the [syntactical] order of the words) 
the Benign, the Beneficent, the True to His promise, the Merciful, One of tremendous mercy.","Indeed, the righteous will be in gardens and bliss, . enjoying what their Lord has given them, and their Lord protected them from the punishment of the Blazing Fire. . “Eat and drink pleasantly for what you used to do, . reclining on couches all lined up”. And We will marry them to houris with wide beautiful eyes. . As for those who believe and their offspring follow them in faith, We will cause their offspring to join them, and will not detract anything from [the reward of] their deeds. Everyone will be accountable for what he earned[9]. . And We will provide them with whatever fruit and meat they desire. . They will pass around to one another a glass [of pure wine] which does not lead to idle talk or sin. . They will be served by their servant boys, as if they were well-protected pearls. . They will turn to one another with questions[10]. . They will say, “Before this, we used to be in awe [of Allah] when we were living among our people. . Therefore Allah conferred favor upon us and protected us from the punishment of the Scorching Fire. . Indeed, we used to call upon Him before. He is indeed the Most Kind, the Most Merciful.”","[9] i.e., None will be held responsible for the burden of another. . [10] They will probably ask one another about their worldly lives and what led them to Paradise."
52,29,31,"So remind, persist in reminding the idolaters and do not desist [from this] even if they say to 
you that you are a soothsayer or a madman. For by the grace of your Lord, by His bestowal of grace on 
you, you are neither soothsayer (bi-kahinin is the predicate of ma) nor madman (wa-la majnunin, a 
supplement to it). Or (am means bal) do they say, that he is: ‘A poet, for whom we may await the accidents of fate?’, 
the vicissitudes of time, so that he will just die like other poets. 

1 The reading adopted in the translation is the less frequent one nowadays, but it is the one which the commentator takes as Stan¬ 
dard. Basically, the Arabic can be read in two ways, with a different subject (and hence, a different direct object): wa-atbanahum 
dhurriyatihim, ‘and whose descendants We made to follow them’, or wattaba’athum dhurriyatuhum, ‘and whose seed followed them’.

Tafslr al-Jalalayn Say: ‘Await!, my death. For I too will be with you awaiting’, your death. They were then chastised 
with [death by] the sword on the day of Badr.","So keep exhorting [O Prophet], for you are not, by the grace of your Lord, a soothsayer or a madman. . Or do they say: “He is a poet for whom we await a misfortune[11]”? . Say, “Wait, I too am waiting with you.”","[11] i.e., inevitable death or so."
52,32,47,"Or do their faculties of understanding prompt them to [say] this?, their saying to him: [you 
are either] a sorcerer, a poet, a soothsayer or a madman, in other words, they do not [in reality] prompt 
them to [say] this. Or (am, [in effect] means bal, ‘rather’) are they a rebellious lot?, because of their 
obdinacy. Or do they say, ‘He has improvised it?’, he has conceded the Qur’an. He has not conceded it; 
Rather they do not believe, out of arrogance. If they [continue to] say that he has conceded it: Then let them bring a, conceded, discourse like it, if they are truthful, in what they say. Or were they created out of nothing?, [that is] without a Creator. Or are they the creators?, of 
themselves. It makes no sense for a created thing to have no creator, nor can a thing that will cease to 
exigent [have the power to] create. There mud be a Creator of them, and that is God, the One, so why 
do they not affirm His Oneness and believe in His Messenger and His Book? Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nor can any but God, the Creator, have created 
them, so why do they not worship Him? Nay, but they are not certain, of Him, for otherwise they would 
have believed in His Prophet. Or do they possess the treasuries of your Lord?, in the way of prophethood, provision and other 
matters, so that they are able to assign what they will exclusively to whom they will? Or are they the ones 
in control?, [or] are they the mighty ones who hold sway? (the verb [from musaytiruna ] is saytara, simi¬ 
lar [in root form] to baytara, ‘to practice veterinary medicine’, or bayqara, ‘to corrupt’, ‘to ruin’). Or do they have a ladder, a means of ascension into the heaven, whereby they eavesdrop?, that 
is, at the top of which [they liden in], on the conversations of the angels, so that they are then able to 
dilute with the Prophet, as they claim. If that is what they assert: Then let their eavesdropper, [let] the 
one claiming to be able to liden [in on their conversations] on top of this [ladder], produce a manifest 
warrant, a plain and evident proof. Now, on account of the similarity of this assertion to their assertion 
that the angels are the daughters of God, He, exalted be He, says: Or does He have daughters, as you claim, whereas you have sons? Exalted be God above what 
you claim! 

[ 5 2:40] Or are you asking them for a fee, a wage in return for what you have brought them in the way of 
religion, so that they are weighed down with debt?, [with] the liability for this, so that they are unable 
to submit [to God].  Or do they have [access to] the Unseen, that is, the knowledge of it, so that they can write it 
down?, and are hence able to dilute with the Prophet (s) regarding the Resurrection and the matters 
relating to the Hereafter, as they claim. Or do they desire to outmanoeuvre?, you and have you killed, at the Assembly Council. But 
those who disbelieve, they are the outmanoeuvred ones!, the vanquished and the ones dedroyed. God 
preserved him from them and then dedroyed them at Badr. Or do they have a god other than God? Glory be to God [exalted is He] above any partners that 
they may ascribe!, to Him in the way of gods (the succession of interrogatives with am, ‘or’, are intended 
to express censure and rebuke). And if they were to see a fragment, a portion, of the heaven falling, on them — as they say, Then 
make fragments of the heaven fall upon us [Q. 26:187], as a chadisement for them — they would say, this 
is: A heap of clouds!’, piled on top of one another, that will bring us water; and so they do not believe.

Sura al-Tur So leave them until they encounter that day of theirs in which they will be thunderstruck, [in 
which] they will die; the day when their guile will avail them nothing ( yawma Idyughni is a substitution for yawma- 
humu, ‘that day of theirs’) and they will not be helped, they will [not] be protected from the chastisement 
in the Hereafter. And assuredly for those who do wrong, by their [persistence in] disbelief, there is a chastisement 
beyond that, in this world, before their death — thus they were punished with famine and drought for 
seven years, and with being killed on the day of Badr; but moSt of them do not know, that the chastise¬ 
ment will befall them.","Do their minds[12] prompt them to say such things, or are they transgressing people? . Or do they say, “He has made this [Qur’an] up”? Rather, they are not willing to believe. . Then let them produce a discourse like this, if they are truthful[13]. . Were they created by none, or were they the creators [of themselves]? . Or did they create the heavens and earth? Rather, they are not certain in faith. . Or do they possess the treasures of your Lord, or do they have full control [of everything]? . Or do they have a stairway [to the heaven] by which they eavesdrop? Then let those who eavesdrop produce a compelling proof. . Or does He have daughters while you have sons[14]? . Or are you asking them [O Prophet] for a reward so they are overburdened by debt? . Or do they have [the knowledge of] the unseen so they are writing it down? . Or do they intend a plot [against the Prophet]? But the plot of the disbelievers will rebound against themselves. . Or do they have a god other than Allah? Glory be to Allah far above what they associate with Him. . If they were to see pieces of the sky falling down[15], they would still say, “[This is only] a mass of clouds.” . So leave them alone until they encounter their Day in which they will be struck down[16], . the Day their plots will not avail them in the least, nor will they be helped. . And for the wrongdoers, there will be another punishment before that[17], but most of them do not know.","[12] The leaders of pagans in Makkah claimed to be of great minds. Here it questions their intelligence, arguing that a man cannot be a madman and a poet at the same time. . [13] Arab pagans were challenged to produce the like of this Quran, ten surahs, or one surah, but the challenge has never been met until the present day. See 2:23, 11:13, 52:34. . [14] See footnote 37:149. . [15] As a sign of the punishment that they requested. . [16] i.e., they will be punished on the Day of Judgment. .

signs]. He thus saw from among the marvels of the Realm ( malakiit ) 1 a green drape ( rafraf) that obscured 
the [entire] horizon of the heaven and Gabriel with his six hundred wings.","By the star when it sets, . Your companion [i.e., the Prophet] has neither strayed nor is he deluded. . Nor does he speak out of his own desire. . It is but a revelation sent down [to him]. . He was taught by [an angel of] mighty power[1], . and of great perfection[2], who manifested himself [in his true form][3] . when he was on the higher horizon[4]. . Then he approached [the Prophet] and descended, . until he was only two bow-lengths away or even closer. . Then he revealed to His slave[5] what he had to reveal. .

53,19,30,"Have you considered al-Lat and al- c Uzza, and Manat, the third, of the preceding two, the other? ( al-ukhra, a derogatory qualification of 
the third one). These were £tone idols which the idolaters worshipped and which they claimed inter¬ 
ceded for them with God (the fir£t diredt objedt of a-fa-ra’aytum, ‘have you seen, is al-Lat and what has 
been supplemented thereto; the second [diredt objedt] has been omitted). The meaning then is, ‘Inform 
Me: do these idols have the power over anything, such that you worship them besides God Who has the 
power over all that has been mentioned?’ And because of their assertion also that the angels were God’s 
daughters, despite their aversion to daughters, the following was revealed: Are you to have males, and He females? That, then, would indeed be an unfair division! (dizan, ‘unfair’, derives from dazahu, yadizuhu, 
to mean: ‘he wronged him’, ‘he was unjust to him). These, that is, the mentioned [deities], are nothingbut names which you have named, by which 
you have named, you and your fathers, idols that you worship. God has not revealed any warrant, [any] 
proof or evidence, for them, that is to say, [for] the worship of them. They follow nothing but conjecture, 
in their worship of them, and that which [ignoble] soids desire, of that which Satan adorned for them, 
that they may intercede for them before God, exalted be He, even though guidance has already come 
to them from their Lord, by the tongue of the Prophet (s), with definitive proof; yet they do not desist 
from their ways. Or shall man, that is, shall every human being among them, have whatever he wishes for?, such 
as [their wish] that the idols intercede for them. [No!] It is not so. Yet to God belong the Hereafter and the former [life], that is to say, [the life of] the world, and 
so nothing comes to pass in them except what He, exalted, wills. 

[ 53:26] And how many an angel, that is to say, many an angel, there is in the heavens, and how honoured 
they are in God’s sight [but], whose intercession cannot avail in any way except after God gives permis¬ 
sion, to them for this [intercession], for whomever He wills, of His servants, and, with whom, He is sat¬ 
isfied, because of His saying: and they do not intercede except for him with whom He is satisfied [Q. 21:28]. 
It is also well-known that it [intercession] cannot be forthcoming from them except after permission for 
it has been granted: who is there that shall intercede with Him save with His leave [Q. 2:255].  Truly those who do not believe in the Hereafter give the angels the names of females, for they 
say: ‘They are God’s daughters’. But they do not have any knowledge thereof, of this claim. They follow, in this [re^edt], nothing 
but conjecture, which they have conjured up, and indeed conjecture can never substitute for the truth, that 
is to say, when it comes to acquiring knowledge of that which one is required to have knowledge of. So shun him who turns away from Our Remembrance, that is, [from] the Qur’an, and desires 
nothing but the life of this world — this was [revealed] before the command to struggle [against the 
disbelievers]. That, namely, the desire of this world, is the full extent of their knowledge, that is, the limit of

of the Divine attributes, with the fourth and final one being that of the lahut, the realm of the Divine Essence; see Muhammad ‘All

Do you choose for yourselves males and for Him females? . That is then an unfair division! . These [idols] are no more than names you and your forefathers have made up[9], for which Allah has not sent down any authority.

53,31,41,"And to God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, that is, He owns 
[all of] that, among which [also] are the misguided one and the [rightly] guided one, leading astray

have done, by way of idolatry and otherwise, and reward those who are virtuous, by [their] affirmation 
of [God’s] Oneness and other acfts of obedience, with the beTt [reward], namely, Paradise. He points out 
‘the virtuous’ as being: Those who avoid grave sins and abominations, excepting lesser offences, that is, minor sins, 
such as a look, a kiss or a touch (this constitutes a discontinuous exception, in other words the meaning 
is: but lesser offences are forgiven by the avoidance of grave sins). Truly your Lord is of vaTt forgiveness, 
for such [lesser sins] and for accepting repentance. The following was revealed regarding those who used 
to say, ‘[What of] our prayers, our fasting, and our pilgrimage!’. He knows you beTt [from the time] when 
He produced you from the earth, that is to say, [when] He created your father Adam from dust, and 
when you were hidden [fetuses] ( ajinna is the plural oijanin) in the bellies of your mothers. So do not 
claim purity for yourselves, do not praise yourselves, that is, in admiration; but [if it is done] in recogni¬ 
tion of [God’s] grace, then that is fine. He knows beTt those who are God-fearing. 

[ 53 : 33 ] Did you see him who turned away, from faith — that is, [the one who] recanted when he was 
derided for it. He said, ‘But I fear the punishment of God!’. But when the one deriding him guaranteed 
him that he would bear God’s chastisement for him, provided that he reverted to his [former] idolatry, 
and he then gave him a stated sum money, he reverted —  and gave a little, of the stated sum of money, and was then grudging?, refrained from [giving] 
the remainder (akda derives from al-kudya, earth that is hard as rock and which prevents the well-digger 
from digging through when he hits it). 

[ 53 : 35 ] Does he possess knowledge of the Unseen so that he sees?, [and therefore] from among such 
[knowledge] he is able to know that another person may bear the chastisement of the Hereafter for 
him? No! This was al-Walid b. al-Mughira, or someone else (the sentence beginning with a-‘indahu, 
‘does he possess’, is the second objecft of the a-ra’ayta, ‘have you seen’, which has the significance of 
‘inform Me!’).  Or ( am means bal) has he not been informed of what is in the scrolls of Moses, the books of the 
Torah, or scrolls before it,

the return and the destination after death, is toward your Lord, whereat He will requite them; and that it is He Who makes to laugh, whomever He will He makes joyous, and makes to weep, 
whomever He will He makes him sorrowful, 

[ 5 3:44] and that it is He Who brings death, in this world, and gives life, for resurrection,  and that He [Himself] creates the two spouses, the two kinds, the male and the female, 

[53:4 6] from a drop [of semen] once it is emitted, [once] it is poured forth into the womb,  and that with Him reSts the second genesis (read al-nashaata, or al-nash’ata ), the other creation, 
for the Resurrection, after the firSt creation, 

[ 5 3:48] and that it is He Who enriches, people by [granting them] sufficient wealth, and grants posses¬ 
sions, [He Who] gives that wealth that is enjoyed as property,  and that it is He Who is the Lord of Sirius — this is a Star [lying] beyond [the constellation of] 
Gemini, which was worshipped in the time of pagandom (jdhiliyya ); and that He destroyed former c Ad (‘Adan al-ula : a variant reading elides the nunation with the 
[following] lam [sc. AdaT-ula ]; this [former one] refers to the people of‘Ad, while the second [‘Ad] is 
that of the people of Salih) and Thamud ( wa-Thamuda: maybe declined, as the name of their forefather, or left as a diptote, 
being the name of the tribe; it is a supplement to Adan) sparing not, a single one of them; and the people of Noah before that, that is to say, before ‘Ad and Thamud, We [also] destroyed 
them; indeed they were more unjust and more insolent, than ‘Ad and Thamud, because of the long time 
that Noah remained among them: and he remained among them a thousand-less-fifty years [Q. 29:14], for 
they, deSjiite their disbelief in him, would [Still] harm him and assault him; 

[ 53 : 53 ] and the Deviant [cities], namely, the cities of the people of Lot, He overturned. He hurled them 
down to the earth after lifting them up to the heaven upside down, by commanding Gabriel to do this;  so that there covered them, of rocks afterwards, that which covered [them]: this is [purposely] 
left vague in order to inspire terror; in [surat] Hud [it is Stated]: We made their uppermost the nethermost, 
and We rained upon them Stones of baked clay [Q. 11:82]. Then which of the bounties of your Lord, [which of] His graces, [graces] which indicate His 
Oneness and power, do you dispute?, do you have doubt about, O man, or deny? This, Muhammad (s), is a Warner, [in the tradition] of the warners of old, of their kind, that is to 
say, he is a messenger like messengers before him, sent to you juSt as they were sent to their peoples. 

[ 53 : 57 ] The Impending [Hour] is imminent: the Resurrection is near at hand.","and that to your Lord is the final return, . and that He is the One Who makes people laugh and weep[16], . and that He is the One Who causes death and gives life, . and that He created the pairs, male and female, . from a drop of sperm when it is emitted, . and it is upon Him to bring about the second creation. . And He is the One Who enriches and bestows wealth, . and that He is the Lord of Sirius[17]. . And that He destroyed the earlier ‘Ād[18], . and Thamūd[19], sparing none, . and [He destroyed] the people of Noah before them; they were indeed more wicked and more rebellious. . And He toppled the cities[20] upside down, . and they were utterly covered [by stones][21]. . Then which of the favors of your Lord do you doubt? . This [Prophet] is a warner like the earlier warners.","[16] i.e., brings happiness or sadness to people. . [17] i.e., a star worshiped by some pagans before Islam. . [18] i.e., the people of Prophet Hūd. . [19] i.e., the people of Prophet Sālih, who are called second Ād. . [20] Of Sodom and Gomorrah whose dwellers defied Prophet Lot (عليه السلام). . [21] They were rained by stones."

as where He says: He alone shall reveal it, at its proper time [Q. 7:187]. 

[ 53 : 59 ] Do you then marvel, in denial, at this discourse, the Qur’an,  and laugh, mockingly, and not weep, when you hear its Promise and Threat, while you remain oblivious?, unmindful and heedless of what is required of you.

54,1,8,"The Hour has drawn near, the Resurrection is close at hand, and the moon has fplit, it broke in 
two at [Mount] Abu Qubays and Qu'ayqa'an, 1 as a sign for the Prophet (s), for it had been demanded 
of him, and [when it took place] he said, ‘Bear witness [now]!’ — as reported by the two Shaykhs [al- 
Bukharl and Muslim]. And if they, the disbelievers among Quraysh, see a sign, a miracle of the Prophet (s), they turn 
away and say, this is: ‘A powerful sorcery!’ ( muftamirr, ‘powerful’, derives from al-mirra, meaning 
‘Strength’; or it [muftamirr] means ‘incessant’). And they denied, the Prophet (s), and followed their own desires, as regards [their] falsehood; 
and every matter, that is good or evil, will be settled, with that person [who is responsible for it], either 
[by his ending up] in Paradise or in the Fire. And verily there has come to them such tidings. Stories about the destruction of communities 
which denied their messengers, as contain a deterrent, to them ( muzdajar is a verbal noun, or a noun 
of place; the dal [of muzdajar ] replaces the ta of [the 8 th form] ifta’ala; one may say, izdajartuhu or za-

by an adjective); wisdom (hikmatun is the predicate of an omitted subject, or a substitution for md, ‘such as’, or for 
muzdajar, ‘deterrent’) [that is] far-reaching, complete; but warnings (nudhur is the plural of nadhir, 
functioning in the [agent] sense of mundhir, ‘a warner’, that is to say, ‘those matters which warn them’; 
md is either for negation, or it is an interrogative of denial, in which case it Stands as a preceding direct

being said). 2 On the day when the Summoner, namely, Israfil ( yawma, ‘the day’, is rendered accusative 
by yakhrujuna, ‘they will emerge’, next [verse]), summons to an awful thing (read nukur or nukr, in the

referring to the subject of [the verb] yakhrujuna, ‘they will emerge’, and so is His saying [muhti’ina]), scrambling, hastening with their necks Stretched out, 3 toward the Summoner. The disbelievers, 
among them, will say: ‘This is a hard day!’, a difficult one for disbelievers — as is Stated in [surat] al- 
Muddaththir, a day of hardship for the disbelievers [Q. 74:9-10].","The Hour has drawn near and the moon has split asunder[1]. .

So turn away from them [O Prophet].

The disbelievers will say, “This is a hard Day!”","[1] The Quraysh pagans challenged the Prophet (ﷺ) to split the moon in two so that they believe in him. The moon was split as they requested and then re-joined, and the incident was reported by several eyewitnesses in different parts of the land; however, they still refused to believe, considering it magic. . [2] The prophets were given signs or miracles as a proof that they were commissioned by Allah. Moses (عليه السلام) was given the miracles of staff and a bright hand. Jesus (عليه السلام) would give life to the dead and heal the blind and the leper. Muhammad (ﷺ) was given the Qur’an, a literary miracle, challenging the masters of Arabic eloquence.

ring to a feminine noun], qawm, ‘tribe’) before them, before Quraysh. Thus they denied Our servant, 
Noah, and said, ‘A madman!’, and he was reviled: they repulsed him with insults and in other ways. And so he invoked his Lord, [saying,] ‘I have been (anni, to be understood as bi-anm) overcome,

Tafsir al-Jalalayn Then We opened (read fa-fatahna or fa-fattahna) the gates of the heaven with torrential waters, 
[waters] pouring down intensely, and We made the earth burSt forth with springs, that flowed forth, and the waters, the waters 
of the heaven and the earth, met for a purpose, a circumstance, that was preordained, [a matter] which 
had been decreed since pre-eternity, namely, their destruction by drowning. And We bore him, that is, Noah, on one, a ship, [made] of planks and nails (dusur is what boards 
are fastened down with of nails and the like; the singular is disar, similar [in pattern] to [kutub] kitdb, 
‘book’), sailing before Our eyes, that is, in Our sights, in other words, [it was being] protected, as retali¬

punishment for them). And verily We left it. We preserved this [deed], as a sign, for whomever might be admonished 
by it, in other words, the news of this [deed] became widely-known and endured. So is there anyone

mudhtakir, but the td ’ has been replaced with a dal, likewise the dhdl, and it [the dal] has been assimilated

‘State’; the intention is to prompt those who are being addressed to affirm the faCt that God’s chastisement 
of those who denied Noah was fully deserved). And verily We have made the Qur 3 an easy to remember. We have facilitated its memorisation 
and disposed it to serve as a [source of] remembrance. So is there anyone who remember?, [anyone who] 
will be admonished by it and memorise it? (the interrogative here is intended as an imperative: in other 
words, memorise it and be admonished by it; none of God’s scriptures is memorised by heart other than 
it [the Qur’an]). 

[ 54:18] Ad denied, their prophet Hud and so they were chastised. How then were My chastisement and 
My warnings?, [how then was] My warning them of the chastisement before it was sent down? In other 
words, it was justified, and He explains this [chastisement] by saying:","The people of Noah rejected [the truth] before them; they rejected Our slave and said, “He is a madman,” and he was intimidated. . So he called upon his Lord, “I am overpowered, so help me!” . So We opened the gates of the sky with water pouring down in torrents, . and We caused the earth to burst forth with springs, then the waters met for a preordained purpose. .

[their] heads from [their] bodies, as if they were, [while lying] in this mentioned State, trunks of up¬

tallness ( nakhlun, ‘palm-trees’, is masculine here but feminine in [surat] al-Haqqa, nakhlun khawiya,

Sura al-Qamar and they said, ‘Is it a mortal ( basharan is in the accusative because it is governed [by a suc¬ 
ceeding verb]) alone among us (minna wahidan are both adjectives of basharan) that we are to follow? 
(nattabiuhu, this explains the verb which renders it [basharan, ‘mortal’] accusative; the interrogative is 
meant as a negative, in other words: why should we follow him when there are many of us and he is only 
one among us and not a king? That is to say, we will not follow him). Then indeed, if we were to follow 
him, we would be in error, a parting with reason, and insanity! Has the Reminder, the revelation, been caSl (read a-ulqiya pronouncing both hamzas, or by not 
pronouncing the second one but in both cases inserting an intervening alif or leaving this [insertion] 
out) upon him [alone] from among us?, in other words, nothing has been revealed to him. Nay, but he 
is a conceited, an arrogant and insolent, liar, in his saying that the mentioned has been revealed to him. 
God, exalted be He, says: ‘They will know tomorrow, in the Hereafter, who is the conceited liar, and it is them, for they will 
be chastised for having denied their prophet Salih. Lo! We are sending the She-camel, We will bring it forth out of the mountain, the rock, as they 
demanded, as a trial, a teSt ,for them, that We may try them. So watch them, O Salih, await [to see] what 
they will do and what will be done with them, and remain patient ( istabir: the ta here has replaced the 
ta of [the 8 th form] ifta’ala), in other words, endure their harm. And inform them that the water is to be divided between them, and the She-camel: one day for 
them and the next for it, every drinking, [every] portion of water, will be attended’, by the people [draw¬ 
ing water] on their [designated] day, and by the She-camel on its day. They adhered to this [regime] but 
eventually became impatient with it and decided to slaughter the She-camel. But they called their companion, Qudar, to slay it, so he took, he drew his sword, and he ham¬ 
strung, with it the She-camel, in other words, he slew her in compliance with their wish. How then were My chastisement and My warnings?. My warning them of chastisement before it 
was sent down? In other words, it was justified. He explains it [their chastisement] by saying: Indeed We unleashed upon them a single Cry, and they became like the chaff of a corral builder 
( al-muhtazir is one who makes a pen from dried tree-branches and thorns for his sheep, to protecft them 
from wolves and beaSts of prey; the fallen parts which they tread are called hashim). And verily We have made the Qur’an easy to remember. So is there anyone who will remember?","Thamūd rejected the warnings, . They said, “Shall we follow a single human being[9] from among us? Then we would surely be in error and insanity! . Has the revelation been sent down upon him out of all of us? Rather, he is an insolent liar.” . Tomorrow they will know who the insolent liar is. . We are sending the she-camel as a test for them, so watch them [O Sālih] and be patient, . and tell them that the water is to be shared between them[10]; each should take its drink in turn. .

54,33,42,"The people of Lot denied the warnings, [they denied] those issues of which they were warned by 
his [Lot’s] tongue. Indeed We unleashed upon them a squall of pebbles, a wind hurling at them pebbles, namely, 
small Stones, a single one [of these] being no larger than the palm of the hand, and they were destroyed; 
[all] except the family of Lot, namely, his two daughters, together with him, whom We delivered at 
dawn, from among the dawns, the morning time of an unspecified day (had a Specific day been meant 
[for that mentioned dawn], it [ sahar ] would have been treated as a diptote [instead of the declined form 
saharin], being a definite noun derived from al-sahar, for with definite nouns one ought to use [the pre¬ 
ceding definite article] al ). So was the squall unleashed at firSt with the family of Lot [Still there]? There 
are two opinions regarding this: in the case of the former [that it was unleashed upon them including the 
family of Lot] the exception is understood as a continuous one, while in the case of the latter [opinion 
that they were delivered before the squall] the exception is understood as a discontinuous one, even if 
it [‘the family of Lot’] is actually subsumed by the collective noun [‘the people of Lot’, and so they were 
delivered] as a kindness [from God]; as a grace ( ni’matan is a verbal noun, that is to say inaman, ‘an aCt of grace) from Us. So, like 
that requital, do We requite him who gives thanks, for Our graces and is a believer, or [it means] him 
who is a believer in God and His messenger and is obedient to both.

Tafsir al-Jaldlayn And verily he had warned them, Lot had threatened them, of Our Strike, Our seizing them with 
chastisement, but they disputed, they contested and denied, the warnings, his warning. And they had even solicited of him his gueSts, that he should let them have their own way with 
those who had come to him as gueSts, that they may do wicked things with them — and these [gueSts] 
were angels. So We blotted out their eyes. We blinded them and made them without slits [so that they 
were continuous folds of skin] like the reSt of the face, by having Gabriel smack them with his wing. ‘So 
taSte [now], so We said to them: taSte, My chastisement and My warnings’, that is to say, [taSte] the ef¬ 
fects and the substance of My warning and My threat. And verily there greeted them in the early morning, the morning time of an unspecified day, an 
abiding chastisement, a permanent [chastisement], continuous with the chastisement of the Hereafter. 

[ 54 : 39 ] ‘So taSte [now] My chastisement and My warnings!’  And verily We have made the Qur’an easy to remember. So is there anyone who will remember? And verily there came to Pharaoh’s folk, his people, together with him, the warnings, the warn¬ 
ing by the tongue of Moses and Aaron, but they did not believe. Rather: They denied Our signs, all, nine, of them, which were given to Moses. So We seized 
them, by way of chastisement, with the seizing of One [Who is] Mighty, Strong, Omnipotent, Powerful, 
Whom nothing can thwart.","The people of Lot rejected the warnings. . We sent against them a storm of pebbles, except the family of Lot whom We saved before dawn, . as a blessing from Us. Thus do We reward those who give thanks. . He had already warned them of Our punishing assault, but they doubted the warnings. . They even demanded that he let them have their way with his angel-guests[14], so We blinded their eyes, [saying], “Taste My punishment and My warnings!” . By the early morning a lasting torment overtook them. . Taste My punishment and My warnings! . We have certainly made the Qur’an easy to understand and remember; is there anyone to take heed? .

54,43,46,"Are your disbelievers, O Quraysh, better than those?, mentioned [beginning] from the people 
of Noah to those of Pharaoh, which is why they have not been chaStised? Or have you, O disbelievers of 
Quraysh, [been granted] some immunity, from chastisement, in the Scriptures?, the Books? (the inter¬ 
rogative in both instances is meant as a denial, in other words: it is not so). Or do they, the disbelievers of Quraysh, say: ‘We are a hoSt that will be helped to victory’?, 
againSt Muhammad (s)? When Abu Jahl, on the day of Badr, said: ‘We are a hoSt that will be helped to 
victory’, the following was revealed: The hoSt will [truly] be routed and turn its back [to flee], and so they were defeated at Badr and 
Gods Messenger (s) was granted victory over them. Nay, but the Hour is their trySt, for chastisement, and the Hour, that is, the chastisement thereat, 
will be more calamitous, greater in affliction, and more bitter, than the chastisement of this world.","Are your disbelievers [O Makkans] superior to those[15] or have you been granted immunity in divine Scriptures? .

him on eighteen or so expeditions, with the exception of Badr and Uhud. He is said to have fought alongside ‘All at the Battle of 
Siffin (37/657), before returning to Medina. He is noted as the most prolific narrator of traditions from the Prophet, and regarded 
highly by hadtth scholars. Many transmitted his traditions which he is supposed to have collected in his sahifa ; see M. J. Kisfer, s.v. 
‘Djabir b. 'Abd Allah’, E12, supplement, 3-4, 230-32; al-Dhahabi, Tadhkira, 1, 43-44, describes him as the ‘jurist of Medina. See al-

fa-yuda’ifahu) for him, from tenfold up to more than seven hundredfold —as stated in siirat al-Baqara 
[Q. 2:261], and [so that] there may be for him, in addition to the multiplied [reward], a generous re¬ 
ward, coupled with satisfaction and prosperity.","Believe in Allah and His Messenger, and spend [in Allah’s cause] out of what He has entrusted you with. For those among you who believe and spend[7], there will be a great reward. . Why is it that you do not believe in Allah when the Messenger is calling you to believe in your Lord, and He has already taken a covenant from you[8], if you will ever believe? . It is He Who sends down clear verses to His slave to bring you out of the depths of darkness into the light. Indeed, Allah is Ever Gracious and Most Merciful to you. . Why is it that you do not spend in the cause of Allah, when Allah alone will inherit the heavens and earth? Those of you who spent and fought before the conquest [of Makkah and those who did not] are not equal. They are much greater in rank than those who spent and fought afterward[9]. Yet Allah has promised each a fine reward, and Allah is All-Aware of what you do. . Who is there to lend Allah a goodly loan, so He will multiply it for him, and for him there will be a generous reward[10]?","[7] In the way of Allah. . [8] See 7:172. .

of your light!’ It will be said, to them in mockery of them: ‘Step back and seek light!’ So they .hep back,

Heights’ [cf. Q. 7:46] — with agate, the inner side of which contains mercy, the side of the believers, and 
the outer side of which, the side of the hypocrites, faces toward the chastisement. They will call out to them, ‘Did we not use to be with you?’, upon [the path of] obedience. They 
will say, ‘Yes, indeed! But you caused your souls to fall into temptation, by [engaging in] hypocrisy, and 
you awaited, reversals of fortune for the believers, and you doubted, you were uncertain about the reli¬ 
gion of Islam, and [false] hopes, greedy desires, deceived you until God’s ordinance, death, came; and 
the Deceiver, Satan, deceived you concerning God. So on this day no ransom will be taken from you (read tu’khadhu or yukhadhu) nor from those 
who disbelieved. Your abode will be the Fire: it will be your guardian, it is [the place truly] deserving

[They will be told], “Glad tidings for you Today: gardens under which rivers flow, abiding therein forever.” That is the supreme triumph. . On that Day the hypocrite men and women will say to those who believe, “Wait for us, so that we may have some of your light.” It will be said, “Go back and seek light elsewhere[11].” Then a wall will be placed between them, which will have a gate[12], on the inside of which there will be mercy and on the outside there will be punishment. . The hypocrites will call out to the believers, “Were we not with you?” They will say, “Yes, but you allowed yourselves[13] to succumb to temptations, you awaited [some misfortune to befall us], you doubted, and you were deceived by false hopes, until Allah’s decree came to pass. Thus the deceiver [i.e., Satan] deceived you concerning Allah. . So this Day no ransom will be accepted from you or from the disbelievers. Your abode is the Fire; it is a fitting place for you – what a wretched destination!”","[11] i.e., the worldly life from where the light was acquired.

Stretch of time, the interval [extending] from them [back] to [the time of the sending of the laSt of] their 
prophets, was too long for them and so their hearts became hardened, unyielding to the remembrance 
of God, and many of them are immoral. Know — an address to the believers [juSt] mentioned — that God revives the earth after its 
death, by [bringing forth] vegetation, and likewise He is able to do with your hearts, restoring them to 
humbleness. We have certainly made clear for you the signs, that testify to Our power with this [men¬ 
tioned example] and others, that perhaps you may understand.","Has the time not yet come for those who believe that their hearts should be humbled at the remembrance of Allah and the truth that has been revealed?

chaff, scatters vanishing with the winds. And in the Hereafter there is a severe chastisement, for those 
who prefer this world to it, and forgiveness from God and beatitude, for those who have not preferred 
this world to it; and the life of this world, that is to say, the comfort [enjoyed] in it, is but the comfort of 
delusion. Vie with one another for forgiveness from your Lord and a garden the breadth of which is as the 
breadth of the heaven and the earth, if one were placed at the end of the other, prepared for those who

God is [dispenser] of tremendous bounty.","Indeed, those men and women who give in charity and lend to Allah a goodly loan, it will be multiplied for them, and for them there will be a generous reward[15]. . Those who believe in Allah and His messengers, it is they who are the people of the truth. And the martyrs will have their reward and their light with their Lord. As for those who disbelieve and reject Our verses, they are the people of the Blazing Fire. .

contrary to their claims that they are God’s beloved and those who deserve His beatitude, and that [all] 
bounty is in God’s hand; He gives it to whomever He will, and hence He has given the believers [in the 
Prophet] among them their reward twofold, as Stated above; and God is [dispenser] of tremendous 
bounty.

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","O you who believe, fear Allah and believe in His Messenger; He will give you a double share of His mercy and will give you a light by which you walk, and forgive you, for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. . [This is] so that the People of the Book may know that they have no power over anything of Allah’s bounty and that all bounty is in the Hands of Allah; He gives it to whom He wills, for Allah is the Lord of great bounty.",
58,1,4,"God has certainly heard the words of her who disputes with you, [her who] consults you, O 
Prophet, concerning her husband, who has repudiated her by zihar — he had said to her, ‘You are to me 
[as untouchable] as the back of my mother’. 1 She asked the Prophet (5) about this and he told her that she 
was [thenceforth] forbidden to him, as was cuStomary among them [at the time of Jahiliyya], namely, 
that repudiation by zihar results in permanent separation. She was Khawla bt. Tha'laba and he was Aws 
b. al-Samit — and complains to God, of her being alone and of her impoverishment while having young 
children, whom if she were to leave with him, they would go astray, but whom, if they remained with her, 
would go hungry. And God hears your conversation, your consulting. Assuredly God is Hearer, Seer, 
[He is] Knower. Those of you who repudiate their wives by zihar (yazzahharuna is actually yatazahharuna, in 
which the ta has been assimilated with the za; a variant reading has yazzdharuna, and Still another 
has yuzahiruna, similar [in form] to yuqdtiluna; the same applies for the second instance [of this verb 
below]), they are not their mothers; their mothers are only those who (read allai, or without the [final 
long] ya, allai ) gave birth to them, and indeed they, [in repudiating them] by zihar, utter indecent 
words and a calumny, a lie. Yet assuredly God is Pardoning, Forgiving, to the one who repudiates by 
zihar through an atonement [which he muSt offer]. And those who repudiate their wives by zihar and then go back on what they have said, instead 
doing the opposite of this and retaining the woman divorced by zihar, that which is contrary to the pur¬ 
pose of zihar in which a woman is characterised as being forbidden — then [ the penalty for them is] the 
setting free of a slave, an obligation upon him, before they touch one another, in sexual intercourse. By 
this you are being admonished; and God is Aware of what you do. And he who cannot find [the wherewithal], [to set free] a slave, then [his redemption shall be] 
the faffing of two successive months before they touch one another. And if he is unable, to fait, then [ the 
redemption shall be] the feeding of sixty needy persons, as an obligation upon him, that is, before they 
touch one another: understanding the unrestricted [prescription] as [having the same restriction as] the 
restricted one. For every needy person [he should give] one mudd measure of the principal food of the 
town. This, namely, lightening of the atonement is, so that you may believe in God and His Messenger. 
And these, namely, the rulings mentioned, are God’s bounds; and for the rejecters, of them, there is a 
painful chaffisement.","Indeed, Allah has heard the words of the woman who was arguing with you [O Prophet] concerning her husband and was complaining to Allah. Allah has heard the discussion between the two of you, for Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing[1]. . As for those among you who divorce their wives by likening them to their mothers[2], they are not their mothers; their mothers are none but those who gave birth to them. They utter words that are abhorrent and false, but Allah is Most Pardoning, Most Forgiving. . But those who divorce their wives by likening them to their mothers then retract what they said, they must free a slave before they are intimate with each other. This is what you are admonished, and Allah is All-Aware of what you do. . But whoever cannot afford this must fast for two consecutive months[3] before the couple have intimate relations with each other. But if he is unable to do that, he must feed sixty needy people. This is so that you may truly believe in Allah and His Messenger. These are the limits ordained by Allah, and for the disbelievers there will be a painful punishment.","[1] Khawlah bint Tha‘labah and her husband Aws ibn As-Sāmit had a disagreement. She came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said that her husband made her unlawful to himself as the zahr (back) of his mother, which was a famous type of divorce in Arabia, called zihār. He (ﷺ) told her that he had not received any revelation in this regard. Finally, this Madinian surah was revealed, and abolished this ancient practice. . [2] By saying to one's wife, ""You are to me like the back of my mother,"" meaning unlawful to approach, which was abolished by the revelation of these verses. . [3] See footnote 4:92."
58,5,6,"Indeed those who oppose God and His Messenger will be abased, humiliated, juft as those before 
them were abased, for opposing their messengers. And verily We have revealed clear signs, indicating 
the truthfulness of the Messenger, and for those who disbelieve, in the signs, there is a humiliating 
chaffisement. The day when God will raise them all together, He will then inform them of what they did. God 
has kept count of it, while they forgot it. And God is Witness to all things.","Indeed, those who oppose Allah and His Messenger will be debased, just as those who came before them were debased, for We have surely sent down clear signs. And for the disbelievers there will be a humiliating punishment. . On the Day when Allah will resurrect them all together and will inform them of what they did; Allah has kept their complete record, while they have forgotten it. For Allah is a Witness over all things.",
58,7,10,"Have you not seen, [have you not] realised, that God knows all that is in the heavens and all that 
is in the earth? Not secret conversation of three takes place but He is their fourth [ companion ], by [vir¬ 
tue of] His omniscience, nor of five but He is their sixth, nor of fewer than that or more but He is with

[but] then returned to that they had been forbidden, and [all the while] hold secret conversations 
[tainted] with sin and [plans for] enmity and disobedience to the Messenger? These were the Jews, 
whom the Prophet (s) had forbidden them what they used to do in their secret talks, that is, their [habit 
of] conversing secretly with one another and giving the believers looks in order to ca£t doubt into their 
hearts [about the faith]. And [who] when they come to you, they greet you, O Prophet, with that with 
which God never greeted you — namely, their saying [to the Prophet]: al-samu ‘alayka, meaning, ‘Death 
[be upon you] ’, 2 and they say within themselves, ‘Why does God not chastise us for what we say?’, in the 
way of such a greeting and [our saying] that he is not a prophet, if he [truly] were a prophet. Hell will 
suffice them! In it they will be made to burn — and [ what] an evil journey’s end!, it is. O you who believe, if you do talk in secret, then do not talk in secret sinfully and in enmity and 
disobedience to the Messenger, but talk secretly in piety and fear of God. And fear God to Whom you 
will be gathered. Secret conversations, [tainted] with sin and the like, are of [ the work of] Satan, [a result] of his 
deception, that those who believe may end up grieving; but he cannot harm them in any way, except 
God’s leave, that is, [except by] His will. And in God let the believers put [all] their trust.","Do you not see that Allah knows all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth? No secret consultation takes place between three, but He is their fourth, or between five, but He is their sixth, or between fewer or more than that, but He is with them wherever they may be[4]. Then He will inform them of what they did on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of everything. . Have you not seen those who were forbidden from holding secret talks, yet they go back to do what they were forbidden from, conspiring in sin and aggression, and in disobedience to the Messenger? When they come to you, they greet you[5] other than the way Allah greets you, and they say to one another, “Why does Allah not punish us for what we say?” Sufficient is Hell for them; they will enter it. What a terrible destination! . O you who believe, when you hold secret counsel, do not do so in sin and aggression, and in disobedience to the Messenger, rather do so in righteousness and piety. And fear Allah, to Whom you will be gathered. . Secret talks are only prompted by Satan to grieve the believers, but he cannot harm them[6] in the least except with Allah’s permission. So let the believers put their trust in Allah.","[4] He is with them by His knowledge. . [5] This is referring to the Jews who used to play with words while addressing the Prophet (ﷺ) to ridicule him, saying ""Asāmu ‘alaikum"" (death be upon you) instead of ""Asalamu ‘alaikum"" (peace be upon you). . [6] Referring to the sinful type of secret talks, as mentioned in the previous verses, or two persons speaking in private in the presence of a third, leading him to assume that he is the subject of their talk."
58,11,11,"Oyouwho believe, when it is said to you, ‘Make room’ during the assembly, during the assembly 
[convened] with the Prophet (s) or for remembrance, so that those arriving to [join] you may [find room 
to] sit ( al-majlis, ‘assembly’, may also be read [in the plural] al-majalis ) then make room; God will make 
room for you, in Paradise. And when it is said, ‘Rise up’, stand up for prayer or for other good deeds, do 
rise up (a variant reading [for unshuzu fa’nshuzu] has anshizu in both instances [sc. anshizu fa’nshizii]); 
God will raise those of you who have faith, [thereby] obeying this [command], and. He will raise, those 
who have been given knowledge by degrees, in Paradise. And God is Aware of what you do.","O you who believe, when you are told to make room in your gatherings, then make room; Allah will give you abundance[7]. And when you are told to rise, then rise; Allah will raise in ranks those who believed from among you and those who are given knowledge. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.",[7] In this life or in the Hereafter.
58,12,13,"Oyou who believe, when you converse in secret with the Messenger, when you wish to converse 
with him privately, offer some voluntary alms before your secret talk. That is better for you and purer, 
for your sins. But if you find nothing, to offer as alms, then God is indeed Forgiving, of your secret 
conversation, Merciful, to you. In other words: nothing will be held against you for holding a secret 
conversation without having offered some voluntary alms [beforehand]. However, He [God] abrogated 
this later by saying: Do you fear (read a-ashfaqtum, either pronouncing both hamzas fully, or by replacing the sec¬ 
ond one with an alif or not pronouncing it, but inserting an aZz/between the one not unpronounced and 
the other one, or without [this insertion]), poverty [when you fear], to offer [voluntary] alms before 
your secret talks. So, as you did not do this, giving of voluntary alms, and God relented to you, waiving 
this [requirement] for you, maintain prayer and pay the alms and obey God and His Messenger, that is 
to say, observe these [duties] regularly. For God is Aware of what you do.","O you who believe, when you consult the Messenger in private, give something in charity before your consultation; that is better for you and more conducive to purity. But if you do not have the means, then Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. . Are you afraid of giving charities before your consultations with him? If you are unable to do so, and Allah has pardoned you, then establish prayer and give zakah, and obey Allah and His Messenger. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.",
58,14,21,"Have you not regarded, [have you not] seen, those who — these being the hypocrites — frat¬ 
ernise with a folk — these being the Jews — at whom God is wrathful? They, the hypocrites, neither 
belong with you, the believers, nor with them, the Jews, but are su fended in between, and they swear 
falsely, in other words, saying that they are believers, while they know, that they are lying in this. God has prepared for them a severe chastisement. Evil indeed is that which they [are wont to] 
do, in the way of acfts of disobedience. They have taken their oaths as a shield, a [means of] protection for themselves and their posses¬

they are believers, juft as they swear to you [now], and suppose that they are [Standing] on something,

world. Yet assuredly it is they who are the liars! Satan has prevailed upon them, by their obedience of him, and so he has caused them to forget 
the remembrance of God. Those are Satan’s confederates, his followers. Yet it is indeed Satan’s confeder¬ 
ates who are the losers! Indeed those who oppose God and His Messenger — they will be among the mo SI abased, the 
vanquished. God has inscribed, in the Preserved Tablet, or [it means] He has decreed: ‘I shall assuredly pre¬ 
vail, I and My messengers’, by means of definitive proof or the sword. Truly God is Strong, Mighty.","Do you not see those [hypocrites] who take as allies people who have incurred Allah’s wrath? They are neither of you nor of them, and they swear falsely while they know. . Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment. Evil is indeed what they do. . They have taken their oaths as a shield, in order to hinder people from the way of Allah. For them there will be a humiliating punishment. . Neither their wealth nor their children will avail them anything against Allah. They are the people of the Fire; they will abide therein forever. . On the Day when Allah will raise them all, they will swear to Him as they swear to you, thinking that they have something to stand on[8]. Indeed, it is they who are the liars. . Satan has taken hold of them and has thus caused them to forget the remembrance of Allah. They are the party of Satan. Indeed, the party of Satan will be the losers. .

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","You will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day taking as allies those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their parents, their children, their brothers, or their kindred. It is they in whose hearts Allah has instilled faith and strengthened them with a spirit[9] from Him. He will admit them to gardens under which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Allah. They are the party of Allah. Indeed, it is the party of Allah that will be successful.","[9] Spirit here means His revelation, light, or His help."
59,1,5,"All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifies God, that is to say, [all that is in 
them] exalts Him as being transcendent (the lam [of li’Llahi, ‘God’] is extra; the use of ma [instead of 
the personal min ] is meant to indicate a predominance [of non-rational beings in the heavens and the 
earth]). And He is the Mighty, the Wise, in His kingdom and [in] His actions [respectively]. It is He Who expelled those who disbelieved of the People of the Scripture, namely, the Jews of 
the Banu al-Nadir, from their homelands, [from] their dwellings at Medina, at the frit exile, that is, 
their exile to Syria, the laSt [exile] being their banishment to Khaybar by ‘Umar during his caliphate. 
You did not think, O believers, that they would go forth, and they thought that they would be pro¬ 
tested (mamatuhum is the predicate of an, ‘that’) by their fortresses (husunuhum, the agent of the verb 
[mani’atuhum], with which the predication is completed) from God, from His chastisement. But God, 
His command and His chastisement, came at them from whence they had not reckoned, [from whence] 
had never occurred to them, from the part of the believers, and He caSt terror ( rub or ruub) into their 
hearts, by having their chief Ka'b b. al-Ashraf slain, destroying [as they did] (read yukharribuna; or 
yukhribuna, [derived] from [4 th form] akhraba ) their houses, in order to take away with them what they 
valued of wood and so on, with their own hands and the hands of the believers. So take heed, O you 
who have eyes! And had God not prescribed, [had He not] decreed, banishment for them, departure from 
their homeland, He would have chastised them in this world, by having them killed or taken cap¬ 
tive, as He did with the Jews of [Banu] Qurayza, and in the Hereafter there is for them the chastise¬ 
ment of the Fire. That is because they defied, they opposed, God and His Messenger; and whoever defies God, 
indeed God is severe in retribution, againSt him. Whatever palm-trees you cut down, O Muslims, or left Standing on their roots, it was by God’s 
leave: He gave you the choice in this matter, and in order that, by giving [you] leave to cut them down, 
He might disgrace those who are immoral, the Jews, in return for their objection that the cutting down 
of productive trees was [deliberate] Spoiling [of the land].","All that is in the heavens and all that is on earth glorifies Allah, for He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. . It is He Who expelled the disbelievers of the People of the Book[1] from their homes as the first banishment[2]. You did not think that they would leave, and they thought that their fortresses would protect them from Allah. But [the punishment of] Allah came upon them from where they did not expect and He cast dread in their hearts, destroying their homes with their own hands[3] and the hands of the believers. So take a lesson, O you people of insight. . Had Allah not decreed exile for them, He would have surely punished them in this world. And in the Hereafter, there will be for them the punishment of the Fire. . That is because they opposed Allah and His Messenger. And whoever opposes Allah, Allah is truly severe in punishment. . Whatever palm trees you cut down[4] or left standing on their trunks[5], it was by Allah’s Will, so that He might disgrace the evildoers[6].","[1] It refers to the Jews of Banū Nadīr, who broke their pact with the Prophet (ﷺ).
 [2] This was the first time ever that they were gathered and expelled from Madinah to the Levant.

 [5] To benefit from them.
 [6] When the Muslim army was about to enter the fort of Banū Nadīr, they cut down some of their palm trees, so the Jews were terrified and alleged that this was corruption. So the Muslims disagreed about it; some of them said not to cut the trees, for these are gains that Allah has bestowed upon us, while some others said that we cut them off to enrage them. Hence, this verse was revealed to appease both parties of the Muslims, proclaiming that all this happened by the will of Allah. They were treated as such for their betrayal as they broke their pact with the Prophet (ﷺ)."

for it any (min is extra) horses or camels, that is to say, you did not suffer any hardship in [securing] it, 
but God gives His messengers sway over whomever He will, and God has power over all things: hence 
you have no right to any of this [booty], rather it is exclusively for the Prophet (s) and those of the four

he used to divide it up, such that each would receive a fifth of the fifth and the reSt being the Prophet’s (5),

needy, those Muslims in need, and the traveller, the Muslim who may be cut off [from all resources] on

As for those who were settled in the city [of Madinah][10] and embraced Islam before them, they love those who migrated to them and find no covetous desire in their hearts for what they were given.

help them, they would surely turn their backs [ to flee] (the implied response to the oath suffices in place

God — [but only] because He has deferred His chastisement [to the Hereafter]. That is because they are

fied towns or from behind some wall (jidar: a variant reading has [plural] judur, ‘walls’), some [kind of 
protective] fence. Their might, their belligerence, is great among themselves. You [would] suppose them 
to be all together, united as a [single] body, but their hearts are disunited, scattered, contrary to supposi¬ 
tion. That is because they are a people who have no sense; 

[59 : i5] their likeness in relinquishing faith is, as the likeness of those who, recently before them, a short 
time before — these being the idolaters from among those [who fought] at Badr — tatted the evil conse¬

there will be a painful chattisement, in the Hereafter.  In addition, their likeness in heeding the [words of the] hypocrites and their forsaking of them is, 
like Satan when he says to man, ‘Disbelieve!’; so that when he [man] disbelieves, he says, ‘Lo! I am ab¬ 
solved of you. Indeed I fear God, the Lord of the Worlds’, out of mendacity and dissimulation on his part. So the sequel for both will be, that is, [the sequel for both] the one who leads aftray and the one

If they are expelled, they will not leave with them, and if they are attacked, they will not come to their aid. Even if they come to their help, they will certainly turn and flee, then they will not be helped. . Indeed, your fear in their hearts is greater than their fear of Allah. That is because they are a people devoid of understanding. . They will not fight you all together but in fortified towns or from behind walls. Their valor among themselves is great; you think they are united, but their hearts are divided. That is because they are people who do not understand. . They are like those who were shortly before them[12], who tasted the evil consequence of their deeds, and for them there will be a painful punishment. . They are like Satan when he says to man, “Disbelieve,” then when he disbelieves, he says, “I have nothing to do with you. I surely fear Allah, the Lord of the worlds.” . So they will both end up in the Fire, abiding therein forever. That is the recompense of the wrongdoers.","[11] i.e., the Jews of Banu Nadīr. .

makes them forget their own soids, [to forget] to send ahead good deeds for its sake. Those — they are 
the immoral. Not equal are the inhabitants of the Fire and the inhabitants of Paradise. It is the inhabitants 
of Paradise who are the winners.","O you who believe, fear Allah, and let every soul consider what it has sent forth for tomorrow[13]. And fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is All-Aware of what you do. .

59,21,24,"Had We sent down this Qur’an upon a mountain, and had it [the mountain] been endowed with 
a faculty of discernment like man, you would have surely seen it humbled, rent asunder by the fear of

refled, and so become believers. He is God, than Whom there is no other god, Knower of the unseen and the visible, what is 
secret and what is proclaimed — He is the Compassionate, the Merciful. He is God, than Whom there is no other god, the King, the Holy, the One sanctified from what

sincerity of His messengers by creating miracles for them, the Guardian ( al-muhaymin : [derives] from

Witness to the deeds of His servants, the Mighty, the Strong, the Compeller, compelling His creatures 
to what He will, the Exalted, above what does not befit Him. Glorified be God — He is declaring His 
transcendence — above what partners they ascribe!, to Him. He is God, the Creator, the Maker, the Originator from nothing, the Shaper. To Him belong 
the, ninety nine, Mod Beautiful Names, cited in hadith ( al-husna is the feminine of al-ahsan ). All that

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","Had We sent down this Qur’an upon a mountain, you would have seen it humbled and break asunder out of awe of Allah[14]. Such are the similitudes We set forth for people so that they may reflect. .

Glory be to Allah far above what they associate with Him. . He is Allah, the Creator[21], the Maker[22], the Fashioner[23]. He has the most beautiful names. All that is in the heavens and earth glorifies Him, for He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.","[14] i.e., The disbelievers’ hearts are harder than the mountains in regard to the Qur’an. .

60,1,3,"Oyou who believe, do not take My enemy and your enemy, namely, the disbelievers of Mecca, for 
friends. You offer, you communicate to, them, the Prophet’s plan (s) to attack them, which he had con¬ 
fided to you, and had kept secret, at Hunayn, [communicating this to them out of], affedion, between 
you and them. Hatib b. Abi Balta'a 1 sent them a letter to that effecft, on account of his having children 
and close relatives, idolaters, among them. The Prophet (s) intercepted it from the person to whom he 
[Hatib] had given it to deliver, after God apprised him of this. Hatib’s excuse for this [conducft of his] was 
accepted [by the Prophet]; when verily they have disbelieved in the truth that has come to you, that is, 
[in] the religion of Islam and the Qur’an, expelling the Messenger and you, from Mecca, by oppressing 
you, because you believe in God, your Lord. If you have gone forth to druggie in My way and to seek 
My pleasure... (the response to the conditional is indicated by what preceded, that is to say, [understand 
it as being] ‘then do not take them as friends’). You secretly harbour affedion for them, when I know 
well what you hide and what you proclaim. And whoever among you does that, that is, to secretly com¬ 
municate the Prophet’s news to them, has verily drayed from the right way, he has missed the path of 
guidance (originally, al-sawa means ‘the middle [way]’). If they were to prevail over you, they would be your enemies, and would dretch out againd you 
their hands, to kill and assault you, and their tongues with evil [intent], with insults and reviling; and 
they long for you to disbelieve. Your relatives and your children, the idolatrous [ones], for whose sake you secretly communi¬ 
cated the news, will not avail you, againSt the chastisement in the Hereafter. On the Day of Resurredion 
you will be separated (passive yufsalu; or read acftive yafsilu, ‘He will separate you’) from them, so that 
you will be in Paradise, while they will be alongside the disbelievers in the Fire. And God is Seer of what 
you do.","O you who believe, do not take My enemies and your enemies as allies, offering them friendship even though they rejected the truth that has come to you, and they have driven out the Messenger and yourselves [from Makkah] simply because you believe in Allah, your Lord – if you have emigrated[1] to struggle in My cause and seek My pleasure. How can you disclose secrets [of the believers], showing them friendship, when I know best all that you conceal and all that you reveal? Whoever among you does that has truly strayed from the straight path. . If they gain the upper hand over you, they would be your [open] enemies and would stretch their hands and tongues towards you to harm you, and they wish that you too would disbelieve. . Neither your relatives nor your children will benefit you on the Day of Resurrection; He will judge between you, and Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.",[1] From Makkah.
60,4,7,"Verily there is for you a good example (read iswa or uswa in both instances, meaning qudwa ) in 
[ the person of] Abraham, in terms of [his] sayings and deeds, and those who were with him, of believers, 
when they said to their people, ‘We are indeed innocent of you (bura’a is the plural of barf, similar [in 
form] to zarif ‘charming’) and of what you worship besides God. We repudiate you, we disavow you, 
and between us and you there has arisen enmity and hate forever ( wa’l-baghdau abadan: pronounce 
both hamzas fully, or replace the second one with a waw) until you [come to] believe in God alone’, 
except for Abraham’s saying to his father, ‘I shall ask forgiveness for you — [this Statements] excepted 
from ‘a [good] example’, so it is not [right] for you to follow his example in this [reSJjecft] by asking for¬ 
giveness for disbelievers. As for his saying: but I cannot avail you anything againd God ’— that is, either 
againSt His chastisement or [to secure for you of] His reward — he [Abraham] is using it to intimate 
[to his father] that he can do nothing for him other than to ask forgiveness [for him], which [saying] is 
itself based on that [former Statement] albeit excepted [from it] in terms of what is meant by it, even if 
on the face of it, it would seem to be [semantically] part of the [good] example to be followed: Say, ‘Who 
can avail you anything againd God’ [Q. 48:11]; his [Abraham’s] plea of forgiveness for him was before it 
became evident to him that he [his father] was an enemy of God, as mentioned in surat Bara a [Q. 9:114]. 
‘Our Lord, in You we put our trud, and to You we turn [penitently], and to You is the journeying: these 
are the words of the Friend [of God, Abraham] and those who were with him, in other words, they were 
saying: 

1 Hatib fought at Badr alongside the Prophet and it was primarily because of this that the Prophet decided to pardon him after 
a communication from him to the leaders of Quraysh at Mecca, in which he had divulged the Prophet’s plans to attack them, 
had been intercepted. His excuse was that, unlike the families of many of the Emigrants, his family in Mecca was not under the 
protection of anyone and that by divulging this information he had hoped to win the favour of the Meccan leadership and secure 
immunity for his relatives; see Ibn al-Athir, Usd, 1, 659-61 (no. 1011); Lings, Muhammad, 2giff. 


Sura al-Mumtahana Our Lord, do not make us a cause of beguilementfor those who disbelieve, that is to say, do not 
make them prevail over us, left they think that they are following the truth and are beguiled as a result, 
in other words, [ledl] they lose their reason because of us; and forgive us. Our Lord, You are indeed the 
Mighty, the Wise’, in Your kingdom and Your a ft ions. Verily there is for you, O community of Muhammad (s) (laqad kdna lakum is the re^onse to an 
implied oath) in them a good example, for those [of you] who ( li-man kdna is an inclusive substitution 
for -kum [of lakum, ‘for you’] with the same preposition [H-] repeated) anticipate God and the Laft Day, 
that is, [for those] who fear these two, or who expecit reward or punishment. And whoever turns away, 
by befriending the disbelievers, [shoidd know that] God is the Independent, [without need] of His crea¬ 
tures, the Worthy of Praise, to those who obey Him. It may be that God will bring about between you and those of them with whom you are at en¬ 
mity, from among the disbelievers of Mecca out of [your] obedience to God, exalted be He, ajfedion, 
by His guiding them to faith, so that they then become your friends. For God is Powerful, [able] to do 
that — and He did do this after the conquest of Mecca — and God is Forgiving, to them of their paft 
[deeds], Merciful, to them [also].","Indeed, you have a good example[2] in Abraham and those with him, when they said to their people, “We dissociate ourselves from you and whatever you worship besides Allah. We renounce you, and the enmity and hatred have arisen between us and you forever until you believe in Allah alone”, except for Abraham when he said to his father, “I will seek forgiveness for you, but I cannot protect you from Allah in the least.” “Our Lord, in You we put our trust and to You we turn, and to You is the final return.” . Our Lord, do not make us subject to the persecution of those who disbelieve; and forgive us, our Lord. Indeed, You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.” . You certainly have a good example in them, for those who look forward with hope to Allah and the Last Day. But whoever turns away, Allah is indeed the Self-Sufficient, the Praiseworthy. . It may be that Allah will bring about affection between you and those of them whom you hold as enemies. Allah is Most Capable[3], and Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",[2] To be followed. . [3] To accomplish this or whatever He wills.
60,8,9,"God does not forbid you in regard to those who did not wage war againft you, from among the 
disbelievers, on account of religion and did not expel you from your homes, that you shoidd treat them 
kindly (an tabarruhum is an inclusive substitution for alladhina, ‘those who’) and deal with them justly: 
this was [revealed] before the command to Struggle againSt them. Assuredly God loves the juft. God only forbids you in regard to those who waged war again ft you on account of religion and 
expelled you from your homes and supported [others] in your expulsion, that you should make friends 
with them (an tawallawhum is an inclusive substitution for alladhina, ‘those who’). And whoever makes 
friends with them, those — they are the wrongdoers.","Allah does not forbid you from being kind and just to those who did not fight against you nor did they drive you out of your homes. Indeed, Allah loves those who are just. . Allah only forbids you from taking as allies those who fought against you on account of your religion and drove you out of your homes or helped others in driving you out. Whoever takes them as allies, it is they who are the wrongdoers.",
60,10,11,"O you who believe, when believing women come to you, [saying] with their tongues [that they 
are], emigrating, from the [company of] disbelievers — [this was] following the truce concluded with 
them [the disbelievers] at al-Hudaybiyya to the effecft that if any of their number should go to [join] the 
believers, that person should be sent back — teft them, by making them swear that they had only gone 
forth [from Mecca] because of their [sincere] wish to embrace Islam, and not out of some hatred for their 
disbelieving husbands, nor because they might be enamoured by some Muslim man: that was how the 
Prophet (s) used to take from them their oaths. God knows be ft [ the date of] their faith. Then, if you 
know them, if you suppose them, on the basis of their oaths, to be believers, do not send them back to the 
disbelievers. They [ the women ] are not lawful for them, nor are they [ the disbelievers ] lawful for them. 
And give them, that is to say, their disbelieving husbands, what they have expended, on them [on such 
women], in the way of dowries. And you would not be at fault if you marry them, on that [previous] 
condition, when you have given them their dowries. And do not hold on (read tumassiku or tumsiku) to 
the [conjugal] ties of disbelieving women, your wives, for your Islam automatically prohibits you from 
this, or [to the ties of] those apostatising women who return to the idolaters, for [likewise] their apofta- 
tising automatically prohibits you from marrying them, and ask for, demand, [the return of] what you 
have expended, on these women, of dowries, in the event of apoftasy, from those disbelievers to whom 
they are married. And let them ask for what they have expended, on those women who have emigrated, 
as explained above, that it may be repaid to them. That is God’s judgement. He judges between you, 
therewith, and God is Knower, Wise. And if you lose any of your wives, that is to say, [if you lose] one or more of them — or [it means 
if you lose] anything of their dowries — by [their] going, to the disbelievers, as apoftates, and so you re¬ 
taliate, you embark upon a raid and capture Spoils [from them], then give those whose wives have gone, 
from the Spoils, the like of what they have expended, for their having loft it to the disbelievers. And fear 
God in Whom you believe. And indeed the believers did what they had been commanded to do in the 
way of paying [back] the disbelievers [the dowries of their former wives] and the believers [the dowries 
of the women who had apoftatised]. Afterwards, however, this ftipulation was annulled.

Tafsir al-Jalalayn","O you who believe, when the believing women come to you as migrants, test their sincerity, although Allah knows best about their faith. Then if you find them to be believers, do not send them back to the disbelievers; they are not lawful [wives] for them, nor are they lawful [husbands] for them. But give the disbelievers whatever [dowries] they have spent[4]. And there is no blame on you if you marry them, as long as you give them their dowries. Do not hold on to the marriage ties with the disbelieving women[5]; ask for repayment of whatever [dowries] you have spent, and let the disbelievers ask for repayment of whatever [dowries] they have spent[6]. This is the ruling of Allah that He judges between you, and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. . If any of your wives desert you and join the disbelievers [without returning your dowries], and later you take spoils from them, then give to those whose wives have deserted them the equivalent of what they had spent. And fear Allah, in Whom you believe.","[4] i.e., compensate for their loss. [5] i.e., do not stop them from joining the disbelievers.
 [6] If a disbelieving wife opted to join the disbelievers, a Muslim husband could demand in return the equivalent of her dowries. Similarly, the disbelievers had a similar right if a believing woman joined the Muslims. This and the following verses were revealed after the Treaty of al-Hudaybiyyah."
60,12,13,"O Prophet, if believing women come to you, pledging allegiance to you that they will not ascribe 
anything as partner to God, and that they will not Steal, nor commit adultery, nor slay their children, 
as used to be done during the time of pagandom (jahiliyya ), when they would bury new-born girls alive, 
fearing ignominy and impoverishment, nor bring any lie that they have invented [originating] between 
their hands and their legs, that is, [by bringing] a foundling which they then [falsely] ascribe to the hus¬ 
band — it [the lie] is described in terms of a real child, because when a woman gives birth to a child, it 
falls between her hands and legs; nor disobey you in, doing, what is decent, which is that which concords 
with obedience to God, such as refraining from wailing, ripping apart [their] clothes [in grief], pulling 
out [their] hair, tearing open the front of [their] garments or scratching [their] faces, then accept their 
allegiance — the Prophet (s) did this [but] in words, and he did not shake hands with any of them — and 
ask God to forgive them; surely God is Forgiving, Merciful. O you who believe, do not befriend a people again St whom God is wrathful, namely, the Jews. 
They have truly despaired of the Hereafter, of [attaining] its reward — despite their being certain of 
its truth, out of obstinacy towards the Prophet, even though they know him to be sincere —juSl as the 
disbelievers have despaired — they [themselves] being — of those who are in the tombs, that is to say, 
those who are entombed [and barred] from the good of the Hereafter, for they are shown [both] their 
[would-have-been] places in Paradise, had they believed, and the Fire for which they are destined.

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","O Prophet, when the believing women come to you, pledging to you that they will not associate anything with Allah, that they will not steal, that they will not commit fornication, that they will not kill their children, that they will not falsely attribute [illegitimate] children to their husbands between their arms and their legs[7], that they will not disobey you in what is right, then accept their pledge and ask Allah to forgive them. Indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. . O you who believe, do not take as allies a people whom Allah is displeased with. They have lost hope in the Hereafter, just as the disbelievers have lost hope in those who are in the graves.","[7] It is alluding to falsely attributing a child, whether adopted or born of adultery, to the husband."
61,1,4,"All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifies God, that is to say, [everything] 
proclaims His transcendence (the lam [of li’Llahi ] is extra, and ma has been used instead of min in order 
to indicate the predominance [of non-rational creatures]) and He is the Mighty, in His kingdom, the 
Wise, in His actions. O you who believe, why do you say, in demanding [to participate in] the Struggle, what you do 
not do?, for you retreated at Uhud. It is greatly loathsome ( maqtan is for Specification) to God that you say (an taqulu constitutes the 
agent of [the verb] kabura, ‘it is great [ly]’) what you do not do. Indeed God loves, He assists and honours, those who fight for His cause in ranks (saffan is a cir¬ 
cumstantial qualifier, in other words [understand it as] saffina), as if they were a solid drudure, with all 
of its parts compacted together, firm.","All that is in the heavens and all that is on earth glorifies Allah, for He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. .

61,5,5,"And, mention, when Moses said to his people, ‘O my people, why do you harm me — [for] they 
had said that he had a hernia in his teSticles, which he did not have, and they denied him — when cer¬ 
tainly (qad is for confirmation) you know that I am the messenger of God to you?’ (anni rasulu’Llahi 
ilaykum: this sentence is a circumstantial qualifier) and [when you know that] messengers ought to 
be reSpecfted. So when they deviated, when they swerved away from the truth by harming him, God 
caused their hearts to deviate: He turned them away from guidance, in accordance to what He had 
preordained since pre-eternity, and God does not guide the immoral folk, those who, in His knowl¬ 
edge, are disbelievers.","And [remember] when Moses said to his people, “O my people, why do you hurt me when you know that I am a messenger of Allah to you?” So when they chose to deviate, Allah caused their hearts to deviate, for Allah does not guide the rebellious people.",
61,6,9,"And, mention, when Jesus son of Mary said, ‘O Children of Israel — he did not say ‘O my people’ 
[as did Moses] because he was not related to them in any way — I am indeed God’s messenger to you, 
confirming what is before me of the Torah and bringing good tidings of a messenger who will come 
after me, whose name is Ahmad.’ God, exalted be He, says: Yet when he brought them, [when] Ahmad 
brought the disbelievers, the clear signs, the revelations and the indications, they said, ‘This, namely, 
what has been brought, is manifest sorcery!’ ( sihrun: a variant reading has sdhirun, ‘a sorcerer’, meaning 
the one who has brought them [is a manifest sorcerer]). And who does — that is to say, none does — greater wrong than he who invents lies against 
God, by ascribing a partner and a child to Him and describing His signs as being sorcery, when he is 
[aduallyj being summoned to submission [to God]? And God does not guide the wrongdoing folk, 
the disbelieving [folk]. They desire to extinguish (li-yutfi’u is in the subjunctive form because of an implicit an [sc. an 
yutfi’u], the lam being extra) the light of God, His Law and His proofs, with their mouths, with their 
sayings, that this is sorcery, or poetry or soothsaying; but God will perfed, He will manifest, His light 
(mutimmun nurahu: some have read this in the form of a genitive annextation, mutimmu nurihi ) though 
the disbelievers be averse, to this. It is He Who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, that He may 
make it prevail, that He may raise it, over all [other] religions, [over] all the religions which oppose it, 
though the disbelievers be averse, to this.","And [remember] when Jesus, son of Mary, said, “O Children of Israel, I am truly a messenger of Allah to you, confirming the Torah which came before me, and giving glad tidings of a messenger after me whose name will be Ahmad[1].” But when he came to them with clear proofs, they said, “This is clear magic.” . Who could be more wrong than the one who fabricates lies against Allah when invited to Islam? And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. . They wish to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah will complete His light, even though the disbelievers dislike it. . It is He Who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth, so that He may make it prevail over all religions, even though the polytheists may dislike it.","[1] Another name of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). Both are derived from ""hamd"" which means praise. Some scholars believe that this verse refers to John 14:16, where Jesus says: “And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Paraclete, to be with you forever.” Paraclete in Greek means ‘the praised one.’ Prophet Muhammad's (ﷺ) name is mentioned several times in the Gospel of Barnabas, which the Christian authorities deem as apocryphal Bible."

be my helpers unto God?’, that is to say, who [of you] will be helpers alongside me turning to help God? 
The disciples said, ‘We will be God’s helpers!’ [These] al-hawariyyun [were] the intimates of Jesus, for 
they were the firSt to believe in him. They were twelve men of pure white complexion ( hawar ); but it 
is also said that [their epithet derives from the facft that] they were bleachers ( qassarun ) who bleached 
(yuhawwiruna ) clothes. So a group of the Children of Israel believed, in Jesus, saying: ‘He is [indeed] 
the servant of God, [who has been] raised to heaven’, while a group disbelieved, because they said that 
he was the son of God, whom He had raised unto Himself. Thus the two groups waged war against one 
another. Then We ftrengthened those who believed, of the two groups, againft their enemy, the disbe¬ 
lieving groups, and so they became the triumphant, the vicftors.

and in His acftions: those [mentioned as coming afterwards] are the Successors ( al-tabiuna );* and it suf¬

mentioned with him — and God is [dispenser] of tremendous bounty.","All that is in the heavens and all that is on earth glorifies Allah, the Sovereign, the Most Holy, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. . It is He Who has sent among the unlettered [Arabs] a messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His verses and purifying them, and teaching them the Book and Wisdom [i.e., Sunnah], although before that they were clearly misguided. . And [he is also sent] to others of them who have not yet joined them, and He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. .

lives, and so they have barred, thereby ,from the way of God, that is, from using them for the Struggle. 
Evil indeed is that which they are wont to do. That, namely, their evil deed, is because they believed, by [affirming faith only with] the tongue,

So fear Allah as much as you can, listen and obey, and spend in charity; that is better for your souls. Whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul, it is they who are successful. . If you lend Allah a goodly loan, He will multiply it for you and forgive you, for Allah is Most Appreciative[3], Most Forbearing, . Knower of the unseen and the seen, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.","[2] Some early Muslims were prevented from emigrating to Madinah by their spouses and children, so they were deprived of the honor of joining the Prophet (ﷺ) and the believers in Jihad and other meritorious deeds. . [3] Who gives much in return for a little work."
65,1,3,"O Prophet, meaning [to address] his community, on account of what follows; or, [it means] say 
to them: when you [men] divorce women, when you intend to [effedt a] divorce, divorce them by their 
prescribed period, at the beginning of it, such that the divorce is effected while she is pure and has not 
been touched [sexually], based on the Prophets (s) explaining it in this way, [as] reported by the two 
Shaykhs [al-Bukharl and Muslim]. And count the prescribed period, keep record of it, so that you may 
repeal [your decision] before it is concluded; and fear God your Lord, obey Him in His commands 
and prohibitions. Do not expel them from their houses, nor let them go forth, from them until their 
prescribed period is concluded, unless they commit a blatant [ad of] indecency, [such as] adultery 
(read mubayyana or mubayyina, corresponding [respectively] to buyyinat, ‘one that has been proven’, 
and bayyina, ‘blatant’), in which case they are brought out in order to carry out the [prescribed] legal 
punishment againSt them. And those, mentioned [Stipulations], are God’s bounds; and whoever trans¬ 
gresses the bounds of God has verily wronged his soul. You never know: it may be that God will bring 
something new to pass afterwards, [after] the divorce, [such as] a retraction, in the event that it was the 
firSt or second [declaration of divorce]. Then, when they have reached their term, [when] they are near the end of their prescribed period, 
retain them, by taking them back, honourably, without coercion, or separate from them honourably, 
leave them to conclude their waiting period and do not compel them to go back [to you]. And call to wit¬ 
ness two juft men from among yourselves, [to witness] the retradtion or the separation, and bear witness 
for the sake of God, and not [merely] for the sake of what is being witnessed or for the sake of the man. 
By this is exhorted whoever believes in God and the Lad Day. And whoever fears God, He will make a 
way out for him, from the distress of this world and the Hereafter; and He will provide for him from whence he never expeded, [from whence] it never occurred 
to him. And whoever puts his trud in God, regarding his affairs, He will suffice him. Indeed God fulfils 
His command. His will (a variant reading [for balighun amrahu ] has the genitive construction [balighu 
amrihi]). Verily God has ordained for everything, [even things] such as comfort and hardship, a meas¬ 
ure, a fixed time.","O Prophet, when you [believers] divorce women, divorce them with concern to their waiting period and keep an accurate count of the waiting period[1], and fear Allah, your Lord. Do not force them out of their houses, nor should they leave unless they commit a clear shameful act. Such are the limits ordained by Allah. Whoever transgresses the limits ordained by Allah has truly wronged himself. You never know, perhaps Allah will bring about a change [of heart] later[2]. . Then when they have approached the end of their waiting period, either retain them honorably or part with them honorably[3]. Call two just men from among yourselves as witnesses, and give true testimony for the sake of Allah. This is an exhortation for those who believe in Allah and the Last Day. Whoever fears Allah, He will make a way out for him[4], . and He will provide for him from where he does not expect. Whoever puts his trust in Allah, He is sufficient for him. Indeed, Allah will surely accomplish His purpose, for Allah has set a destiny for everything.","[1] A wife should only be divorced after the completion of her monthly cycle and before sexual intercourse after purity, or else during a confirmed pregnancy. Her waiting period (‘iddah) begins with the pronouncement of divorce. See 2:228-233.
 [2] Such as regret for divorcing or renewed desire for the wife. . [3] A husband may return to his wife after the first or the second divorce (revocable divorce) or at the end of her waiting period with dignity. If he divorces her a third time, the marriage is terminated at the end of her third waiting period (Irrevocable divorce). The wife will have to marry and get divorced by another man before she can remarry her ex-husband. See 2:230.

mendruate, if you have any doubts, about their waiting period, their prescribed [waiting] period shall 
be three months, and [also for] those who have not yet mendruated, because of their young age, their 
period shall [also] be three months — both cases apply to other than those whose Spouses have died; for 
these [latter] their period is prescribed in the verse: they shall wait by themselves for four months and ten 
[days] [Q. 2:234]. And those who are pregnant, their term, the conclusion of their prescribed [waiting] 
period if divorced or if their Spouses be dead, shall be when they deliver. And whoever fears God, He 
will make matters ease for him, in this world and in the Hereafter. That, which is mentioned regarding the prescribed [waiting] period, is God’s command. His rul¬

magnify the reward for him. Lodge them, that is, the divorced women, where you dwell, that is to say, in some part of your 
dwellings, in accordance with your means ( min wujdikum is an explicative supplement, or a substitu¬

means and not otherwise’) and do not harass them so as to put them in draits, with regard to accom¬ 
modation, such that they would then need to go elsewhere or [be in need of] maintenance [to provide 
for themselves] so that they [are forced to] ransom themselves from you. And if they are pregnant, then 


Tafsir al-Jalalayn 

maintain them until they deliver. Then, if they suckle for you, your children [whom you have] from 
them, give them their wages, for the suckling, and consult together, with them, honourably, with kind¬ 
ness, for the sake of the children, by mutual agreement on a fixed wage for the suckling. But if you both 
make difficulties, regarding the suckling, with either the father withholding [payment of] the wage or 
the mother refraining from performing it, then another woman will suckle [the child] for him, for the 
father, and the mother should not be compelled to suckle it. Let the affluent man expend, on the divorced or the suckling woman, out of his affluence. And let 
he whose provision has been Straitened, restricted, for him, expend of what God has given him, in ac¬ 
cordance with his means. God does not charge any sold save except with what He has given it. God will 
assuredly bring about ease after hardship — which He indeed did by way of the [Muslim] conquests.","As for those women from among you who reached their menopause, in case you doubt, their waiting period is three months, as well as of those who have not yet menstruated. As for pregnant women, their waiting period ends with delivery[5]. And whoever fears Allah, He will make his matters easy for him. . This is the commandment of Allah that He has sent down to you. Whoever fears Allah, He will absolve him of his bad deeds and will reward him immensely. . Let them live where you live [during their waiting period], according to your means, and do not harass them to make their stay unbearable[6]. If they are pregnant, maintain them until they deliver, and if they suckle your child, compensate them, and graciously settle the question of compensation by mutual understanding. But if you fail to reach an agreement, then another woman may suckle the child. . Let the wealthy man spend according to his means. As for the one with limited resources, he should spend according to whatever Allah has given him. Allah does not burden any soul beyond what He has given him. Allah will bring about ease after hardship.",[5] This ruling for the waiting period of pregnant women applies also in case the husband dies. . [6] By compelling them to leave or to ransom themselves.
65,8,12,"And how many ( ka'ayyin: the kaf is the genitive prepositional particle which has been added 
to ayy, ‘which’, to give the meaning of kam, ‘how many’) a town — that is to say, many a town, mean¬ 
ing its inhabitants, disobeyed the command of its Lord and His messengers, then We called it, in the 
Hereafter — even if it has not yet arrived, [God says so] because of the faCt that it will surely come 
to pass — to a severe reckoning and chastised it with a dire chastisement (read nukran or nukuran ), 
namely, the chastisement of the Fire. So it taSled the evil consequences of its condud, the punishment for it, and the consequence of its 
conduct was [utter] loss, failure and destruction. God has prepared for them a severe chastisement (the reiteration of the threat is for emphasis). 
So fear God, O people of pith, O possessors of intellect, [you] who believe! (this is a description of the 
vocative, or an explication of it) God has certainly revealed to you a [source of] remembrance, that is, 
the Qur’an; a messenger, that is, Muhammad (s') (rasulan is in the accusative because of an implied verb, 
that is to say, wa-arsala, ‘and He sent you [a messenger]’) reciting to you the clear signs of God (read 
mubayyanat or mubayyinat, as [explained] above) that He may bring forth those who believe and per¬ 
form righteous deeds, after the arrival of the remembrance and the Messenger, from darkness, the dis¬ 
belief to which they adhered, to light, the faith that was established in them after [a life of] disbelief. And 
those who believe in God and ad righteously, He will admit them (a variant reading has the firSt person 
plural [nudkhilhu, ‘We will admit them’]) into gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will 
abide forever. God has verily made a good provision for him, namely, the provision of Paradise, the bliss 
of which never ends. God it is Who created seven heavens, and of earth the like thereof, that is to say, seven earths. 
The command, the revelation, descends between them, between the heavens and the earth: Gabriel de¬ 
scends with it from the seventh heaven to the seventh earth, that you may know (li-taTamu is semanti¬ 
cally connected to an omitted clause, that is to say, ‘He apprises you of this creation and this sending 
down [that you may know]’), that God has power over all things and that God encompasses all things 
in knowledge.

66,1,5,"O Prophet! Why do you prohibit what God has made lawful for you, in terms of your Coptic 
handmaiden Mariya — when he lay with her in the house of Hafsa, who had been away, but who upon 
returning [and finding out] became upset by the fad: that this had taken place in her own house and on 
her own bed — by saying, ‘She is unlawful for me!’, seeking, by making her unlawful [for you], to please 
your wives? And God is Forgiving, Merciful, having forgiven you this prohibition. Verily God has prescribed. He has made lawful, for you [when necessary] the absolution of your 
oaths, to absolve them by expiation, as mentioned in the surat al-Maida [Q. 5:89] and the forbidding 
of [sexual relations with] a handmaiden counts as an oath, so did the Prophet (s) expiate? Muqatil [b. 
Sulayman] 1 said, ‘He set free a slave [in expiation] for his prohibition of Mariya; whereas al-Hasan [al- 
Basri] said, ‘He never expiated, because the Prophet (s) has been forgiven [all errors]’. And God is your 
Protestor, your Helper, and He is the Knower, the Wise. And, mention, when the Prophet confided to one of his wives, namely, Hafsa, a certain matter, 
which was his prohibition of Mariya, telling her: ‘Do not reveal it!’; but when she divulged it, to ‘A’isha, 
reckoning there to be no blame in [doing] such a thing, and God apprised him. He informed him, of 
it, of what had been divulged, he announced part of it, to Hafsa, and passed over part, out of gracious¬ 
ness on his part. So when he told her about it, she said, ‘Who told you this?’ He said, ‘I was told by the 
Knower, the Aware’, namely, God. If the two of you, namely, Hafsa and ‘A’isha, repent to God ...for your hearts were certainly inclined, 
towards the prohibition of Mariya, that is to say, your keeping this secret de^ite [knowing] the Prophet’s (s) 
dislike of it, which is itself a sin (the re^onse to the conditional [‘if the two of you repent to God’] has been 
omitted, to be understood as, ‘it will be accepted of both of you’; the use of [the plural] qulub, ‘hearts’, in¬ 
stead of [the dual] qalbayn, ‘both [your] hearts’, is on account of the cumbersomeness of putting two duals 
together in what is effectively the same word); and if you support one another (tazzdhard: the original sec¬ 
ond ta [of tatazahara] has been assimilated with the za; a variant reading has it without [this assimilation, 
tazdhard]) againd him, that is, the Prophet, in what he is averse to, then [know that] God, He ( huwa, [a 
pronoun] for separation) is indeed his Protestor, His supporter, and Gabriel, and the righteous among the 
believers, Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, may God be pleased with both of them ( wa-Jibrilu wa-sdlihu’l-mu’minina 
is a supplement to the [syntactical] locus of the subject of inna [sc. ‘God’]), who will [also] be his support¬ 
ers, and the angels furthermore, further to the support of God and those mentioned, are his supporters, 
assistants of his, in supporting him [to prevail] over both of you. It may be that, if he divorces you, that is, [if] the Prophet divorces his wives, his Lord will give 
him in [your] Head (read yubaddilahu or yubdilahu) wives better than you ( azwdjan khayran minkunna 
is the predicate of ‘asa, ‘it may be’, the sentence being the response to the conditional) — the replace¬ 
ment [of his wives by God] never took place because the condition [of his divorcing them] never arose 
— women submissive [to God], affirming Islam, believing, faithful, obedient, penitent, devout, given to 
fading — or given to emigrating [in God’s way] — previously married and virgins. 

1 Muqatil b. Sulayman al-Balkhi (d. 150/767) was a tradition^ and commentator on the Qur’an, who lived in Marw, Baghdad and 
Basra and taught in Mecca, Damascus and Beirut; within Muslim scholarship his prestige as a traditionift is not great on account of 
his inaccuracy with regard to use of isnads, but also, from the point of view of certain Sunni circles, on account of his frequent use 
of israiliyyat material to fill in the exegesis to names and stories mentioned elusively in the Qur’an; he is also frequently accused 
of extreme anthropomorphism, and of being a Zaydl politically and a Murji’I theologically. While the latter is mo& certainly the 
case, there is no overt evidence, judging by his few extant works to support the claim that he was a Zaydl; see M. Plessner and A. 
Rippin, s.v. ‘Mukatil b. Sulayman, eh, vn, 508-509; cf. also Cl. Gilliot, ‘Muqatil, grand exegete, traditionifte et theologien maudit’, 
Journal Asiatique 279 (1991), 39-85. Muqatil’s Tafsir was published in 5 vols. by ‘Abd Allah Mahmud Shihata (ed.), (Cairo: al-Hay’a 
al-Misriyya al-‘amma, 1979-88), but the work was later retraced. 


Tafsir al-Jalalayn","O Prophet, why do you prohibit [yourself from] what Allah has made lawful to you, seeking to please your wives? Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. . Allah has ordained for you the way to absolve yourselves from your oaths[1]. Allah is your Guardian, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. . And [remember] when the Prophet told one of his wives something in secret. Then when she disclosed it [to another wife], and Allah made it known to him, he told [the disclosing wife] part of what was disclosed and overlooked a part. When he informed her of that, she said, “Who informed you of this?” He said, “I was informed by the All-Knowing, the All-Aware. . You both had better turn to Allah in repentance, for your hearts have faltered. But if you insist on conspiring against him, then indeed Allah is his Protector, as well as Gabriel and the righteous believers, and moreover, the angels are his supporters. .

Their husbands could not avail them anything against Allah, and they both were told, “Enter the Fire along with those who enter!” . And Allah sets forth an example for the believers: the wife of Pharaoh, who said, “My Lord, build for me a house in Paradise near You, save me from Pharaoh and his [evil] deeds, and save me from the wrongdoing people.” . Also [the example of] Mary, daughter of ‘Imrān who guarded her chastity, so We breathed into her through Our angel [Gabriel][4], and she firmly believed in the words of her Lord and His Scriptures and was one of the obedient.","[3] In the matter of religion, for they both were disbelievers. .

You do not see in the Compassionate One’s creation, of these or of other things, any irregularity, any

a meteor of fire detaches itself from the Star, juSt like a brand is taken from a fire, and either kills that

prepared for them the chastisement of the Blaze, the ignited Fire.","Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the dominion, and He is Most Capable of all things. .

main, ‘running water’, as is Stated in a hadith. This verse was recited before a certain tyrant who then 
replied, ‘Hatchets and pickaxes will bring it!’, whereupon the water of his eyes dried up and he became

Meccan, consisting of 52 verses. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","Say, “What do you think[9], if Allah causes me and those who are with me to die or shows us mercy, who will save the disbelievers from a painful punishment?” . Say, “He is the Most Compassionate; we believe in Him and put our trust in Him. You will come to know who is clearly misguided.” . Say, “What do you think, if your water were to sink deep into the earth, who can bring you flowing water?”","[9] i.e., Inform me."
68,1,4,"Nun, one of the letters of the alphabet: God knows be St what He means by it. By the Pen, with 
which He has inscribed [the records of] all creatures in the Preserved Tablet, and what they inscribe, 
that is, the angels, of good and righteousness. You are not, O Muhammad (s), by the grace of your Lord, a madman, that is to say, madness is 
precluded in your case, on account of your Lord’s grace to you by way of [His assigning to you] prophet- 
hood and in other ways — this was a refutation of their saying that he was a madman. And assuredly you will have an unfailing reward. And assuredly you possess a magnificent nature, [a magnificent] religion.","Nūn[1]. By the pen and what they [i.e., the angels] write [in the Records of deeds], . By the grace of your Lord [O Prophet], you are not a madman. . You will surely have a never-ending reward. . Indeed, you are of a great moral character.",[1] See footnote 2:1.
68,5,16,"Then you will see and they will see, which of you is demented ( al-maftun is a verbal noun, similar [in expressional form] to al¬ 
ma qul, ‘intelligible’; al-futun meaning al-junun, ‘insanity’) in other words, is it [this insanity] in you 
or in them? Assuredly your Lord knows be it those who ftrayfrom His way, and He knows be it those who are 
guided, to Him. So do not obey the deniers. They desire, they yearn, that ( law relates to the verbal acftion) you should be pliable, [that] you 
should yield to them, so that they may be pliable [towards you], [so that] they may yield to you (fa- 
yudhinuna is a supplement to tudhinu, ‘you should be pliable’, but if it is understood to be the response to 
the optative clause of waddu, ‘they yearn, then [a free Standing pronoun] hum should be read as implied 
before it after the fa [sc. fa-hum yudhinuna]). And do not obey any mean, despicable, oath-monger, given to frequent swearing by falsehood, backbiting, faultfinder, that is to say, calumniator, scandal-monger. Spreading [evil] talk among

God has described in the derogatory way in which He describes him, blighting him with ignominy that 
will never leave him (the adverbial qualifier [bada dhalika, ‘moreover’] is semantically connected to 
zanim, ‘ignoble’) — [only] because (an should be understood as li-an, ‘because’, and it is semantically connected to 
that [meaning] which it is indicating) he has wealth and sons. When Our signs — the Qur’an — are recited to him, he says, that they are [merely], ‘Fables of 
the ancients!’, in other words, he denies them [in arrogance] on account of the mentioned things which 
We have beStowed on him out of Our grace (a variant reading [for an of the previous verse] has [the 
interrogative] a-an ). 1 


The verse would then read, ‘Is it because he has wealth and sons?’

He called the Prophet (ﷺ) a madman, so the Qur’an responded by mentioning ten of Al-Walīd’s qualities. (See 53:33-35 and 74:11-26). Two of those qualities were not known to him: the fact that he was an illegitimate child and that his nose would be chopped off years later at the Battle of Badr. Khālid ibn al-Walīd and two of his brothers embraced Islam."

We tried the owners of the garden, the orchard, when they vowed that they woidd pluck, [that] they would 
pick its fruits, in the morning, so that the poor folk would not notice them and so that they would not then 
have to give them of it that [portion] which their father used to give them of it by way of charily. And they did not make any exception, to their vow, for God’s will (the sentence is a new [syntac¬ 
tically independent] one, in other words: and that was their condition). Then a visitation from your Lord visited it, [that is] a fire consumed it during the night, while 
they slept. So by the morning it was like the darkness of night, in other words, black. 2 They then called out to one another in the morning, [saying], ‘Goforth early to your tillage, your produce ( ani’ghdu ‘ala harthikum constitutes an 
explication of [the import of] tanadaw, ‘they called out to one another’; otherwise, an relates to the ver¬

fruits] (the response to the conditional is indicated by what preceded it). So off they went, whimpering to one another, talking secretly: ‘No needy person shall today come to you in it’ (this constitutes the explication of the preceding 
[verse]; or else, an relates to the verbal aCtion, [to be understood] to mean bi-an). And they went forth early, supposing themselves, able to prohibit, to prevent the poor folk [from 
enjoying the fruit], But when they saw it, blackened and charred, they said, ‘Assuredly we have Strayed!’, from it, 
that is to say: this is not the one. Then when they recognised it, they said: ‘Nay, but we have been deprived!’, of its fruits, by our denying it to the poor folk. The moil moderate, the beSt one, among them said, ‘Did I not say to you, “Why do you not 
glorify?” ’, God, repenting [to Him]. They said, ‘Glory be to God, our Lord. Verily we have been wrongdoers’, by denying the poor 
folk [what is] their due. They then turned to one another, blaming each other. They said, ‘O ([yd is] for calling attention to something) woe to us!, [O] destruction of ours. We 
have indeed been unjuSl. It may be that our Lord will give us in its place (read yubaddilana or yubdilana) one that is 
better than it. Tridy we turn humbly to our Lord’, that He might accept our repentance and give us 
back [a garden that is] better than our garden — it is reported that they were indeed given a better

since there is no mention of any fire; cf. other Quranic verses where land is left desolate, or where palm-trees are left collapsed

is assuredly greater, did they but know, its chastisement, they would not have contavened Our com¬ 
mand. When they said ‘If we are resurrected, we shall be given better than [what] you [have been given], 
the following was revealed:","Indeed, We have tested them [i.e., the Makkans] as We tested the people of the garden when they swore to harvest its fruits in the early morning, . and made no exception [by saying: if Allah wills][4]. . Then it was struck by an affliction from your Lord while they were asleep, . and it turned to ashes [as black as night]. . Then in the early morning they called out to one another: . “Go early to your garden if you really wish to harvest.” .

But when they saw the garden, they said, “We must have lost our way! . Rather, we have been deprived.” . The best among them said, “Did I not say to you to glorify Allah[6]?” . They said, “Glory be to our Lord! We were truly wrongdoers.” . Then they turned to one another, throwing blame. . They said, “Woe to us! We were surely transgressors. .

The text of the Hadith is as follows: ""... Then the Lord will uncover His Shank, so they will prostrate to Him..."". . [10] During the life of this world. .

with it, and which if severed results in that persons death, and not one of you (ahadin is the subjedt of ma, min being extra, used to emphasise the nega¬

predicate of [the preceding] ma, and it is used in the plural because ahad, when employed in a negatory 
context, denotes a plural sense; the [suffixed] pronoun in ‘anhu refers to the Prophet), in other words, 
there is none to prevent Us from punishing him. And assuredly it, that is, the Qur’an, is a reminder for the God-fearing. And assuredly We know that some of you, O people, are deniers, of the Qur’an, and [some of 
you are] believers [in it]. And assuredly it, that is, the Qur’an, is a [cause of] anguish for the disbelievers, when they see 
the reward of those who affirmed its truth and the punishment of those who denied it. And assuredly it, that is, the Qur’an, is the certain truth. So glorify, exalt as transcendent, the Name ( bi’smi: the ba [bi-] is extra) of your Lord, the Tre¬

a location between Mecca and Ta’if — these [jinn] being those mentioned in God’s saying, And when 
We sent a company of jinn your way...’ [Q. 46:29] — listened, to my recitation, then said, to their people 
upon returning to them: “We have indeed heard a marvellous Qur’an, whose clarity, the richness of its

now lords of jinn and humans!’. And they, namely, the jinn, thought juft as you, O humans, thought, that (an: softened in place of

able to escape Him, whether we are on earth or, fleeing from it, in the heavens. And that when we heard the guidance, the Qur’an, we believed in it. For whoever believes in his

in the way mentioned is in accordance with what was enjoined on him at the beginning of this sura — 
along with a group of those with you (wa-taifatun mina’lladhina ma c aka constitutes a supplement to 
the subjeCt [of the verb] taqumu, ‘you Stand vigil’, but it may also constitute, although it is not certain, a 
separating clause). The keeping vigil by some of [Muhammad’s] Companions in this way indicates their 
emulation of him. Some of them could not tell how much of the night they had Sjient in prayer and how 
much of it had remained, and would therefore keep vigil all night as a precaution; and so they used to 
keep vigil [in this way] for a whole year or more with their feet swollen, until God alleviated matters 
for them. He, exalted be He, says: and God keeps measures. He keeps count of, the night and the day. 
He knows that (an: softened in place of the hardened form, its subjeCt having been omitted, that is to 
say, annahu ) you will not be able to keep count of it, that is, the [length of the] night, so that you may 
perform the vigil at the time in which it is required unless you shay up all night, which is hard on you, 
and so He has relented to you, making you revert to what is easier. So recite as much as is feasible of the 
Qur’an, during prayer, by performing as much prayer as is feasible. He knows that (an: softened in place 
of the hardened form, that is to say, annahu) some of you will be sick, while others will be travelling in 
the land, seeking the bounty of God, seeking of His provision through commerce and otherwise, and 
others will be fighting in the way of God: for each of the three groups mentioned the keeping of nightly 
vigil is hard, and so God has alleviated things for them by [enjoining on them] what is feasible. Later 
this was abrogated by the five [daily] prayers. So recite as much as is feasible of it (as [explained] above) 
and perform, obligatory, prayer and pay alms and lend God, by expending in the way of good in addi¬ 
tion to what is due from your wealth [as alms], a goodly loan, out of the goodness of [your] hearts. For 
whatever good you send ahead for [ the sake of] your souls, you will find that, with God, it will be bet¬ 
ter, than what you left behind (huwa khayran: huwa is for separation; what follows it [khayran, ‘better’] 
is comparable to a definite, even if it is not [actually] so, on account of the impossibility of it being given 
[the al- of] definition) and greater in terms of reward. And seek forgiveness from God; assuredly God 
is Forgiving, Merciful, to believers.

Mecca, consisting of 56 verses. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","Indeed, your Lord knows that you [O Prophet] stand up in prayer for nearly two-thirds of the night, or half of it, or one-third of it, as do others among your companions. Allah determines the night and the day; He knows that you [Muslims] cannot keep an accurate count of it, so He pardoned you[7]. Recite then as much of the Qur’an as is easy for you [in the night prayers]. He knows that there are some among you who will be ill, and others traveling in the land, seeking the grace of Allah, and others fighting in Allah’s way. So recite as much of it as is easy for you; establish prayer and give zakah; and lend to Allah a goodly loan[8]. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will find it with Allah, much better in condition and much greater in reward[9]. And seek forgiveness of Allah, for indeed Allah is All-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.","[7] The ruling mentioned at the beginning of this surah is lightened here. So from now on, the believers do not have to stick to any of the portions specified there; rather, they can pray whatever they can at night. It is out of the mercy of Allah upon His servants that He does not want hardship for them.
 [8] i.e., giving in charity and for His causes.
 [9] It will be rewarded tenfold, or 700-fold, and Allah gives even more to whoever He wills. See 2:261."

learnt from sorcerers; this is nothing but the speech of humans’, similar to what they [the idolaters] had said: ‘It is only 
a human that is teaching him [Q. 16:103].

he is restored to his former state. It burns away the flesh, scorching the surface of skin. There are nineteen [keepers] Standing over it, angels, its keepers; a certain disbeliever, who was

Stumbling-block, a cause for error, for those who disbelieve, when they then say, ‘Why are there nineteen

those given the Scripture and the believers, [those] other than these [Jews], may not be in doubt, con¬

will and guides whom He will. And none knows the hofts of your Lord, namely, the angels, [none knows 
them] in terms of their Strength and their assistants, except Him. And it, that is, Saqar, is nothing but a 
reminder for humans.","How do you know what Scorching Fire is? . It leaves nothing and spares no one, . scorching the skin. . It is overseen by nineteen [angels]. .

This is but a reminder to mankind.","[8] To say what they want to say, so their punishment will be multiplied for them.

of those things which it used to deny; and the moon is eclipsed, darkening, its light disappearing, and the sun and the moon are brought together, so that both of them will rise from the we\s‘t; or [it 
means when] the light of both of them disappears — and this will be on the Day of Resurrection — on that day man will say, ‘Where is the escape?’ No indeed! — a deterrent against seeking to escape — There is no refuge, no shelter to seek 
protection in. On that day the recourse will be to your Lord, the [final] recourse of all creatures, whereupon 
they will be reckoned with and requited. On that day man will be informed of what he has sent ahead and left behind, [he will be in¬ 
formed] of the his firit and la^t deeds. Rather man has insight into his [own] soul, for his limbs will s^ieak of his deeds (the ha [sc. the 
ta marbuta in basiratun ] is for hyperbole), and so he mu£t be requited, 

[75:1.5] though he should offer his excuses (ma’ddhir is the plural of ma’dhira, but following a different 
pattern [from the usual madhira, maadhir]) that is to say, whatever excuse he offers will not be accepted 
from him. ","I swear by the Day of Resurrection, . and I swear by the self-reproaching soul[1]! . Does man think that We cannot reassemble his bones? .

cannot believe in any other of God’s Scriptures after having denied this [Qur an], since it comprises that

Those, the people of this predicament, are the disbelievers, the profligates, those who have com¬ 
bined disbelief with profligacy.

innahu, ‘truly this is’, up to the la St of the oath clauses) is not a madman, as you claim. For verily he, Muhammad (s), saw him, Gabriel, in the form in which he was created, on the 
clear horizon, the highest one, towards the east; and he, Muhammad (s), is not to be accused of [knowing] the Unseen, what is hidden of the 
revelation and the tidings of the heaven (a variant reading [for bi-zaninin] 1 has bi-daninin, meaning that 
he is not ‘niggardly’ [with the Unseen] so as to reduce something of it [and not disclose it]). And it, that is, the Qur’an, is not the word of an accursed satan, eavesdropping stealthily.","I swear by the receding stars, . that rise and hide[6], . and by the night as it departs, . and by the day as it breaks – . Indeed, this [Qur’an] is a word conveyed by a noble angel-messenger. . extremely powerful, highly revered by the Lord of the Throne, . obeyed there [by other angels] and trustworthy. . Your fellow [i.e., the Prophet] is not a madman. . He indeed saw him [i.e., Gabriel] on the clear horizon[7]. . He does not withhold [knowledge of] the unseen[8]. .

You will perceive in their faces the radiancy of bliss, the Splendour and beauty of blissfulness, as they are given to drink a neilar, a wine free of any impurities, [that is] sealed, in its vessel, 
none other than them breaking its seal, whose seal is musk, that is, whose final sip is followed by an emanating scent of musk — so for 
such [bliss] let the viers vie, let them desire to apply themselves to obedience of God — and whose mixture, that is to say, that with which it is mixed, is ofTasnim, which is explained 
by His [following] words: a spring (' aynan is in the accusative because of an implicit [prefatory] amdahu, ‘I extol [this 
Spring] ’) from which those brought near will drink (yashrabu biha : [should be yashrabu ] minha, or [it

Meccan, consisting of 17 verses. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","Has there not come to you the story of the forces . of Pharaoh and Thamūd? . But the disbelievers are in persistent denial, . although Allah encompasses them from all sides. . But this is a glorious Qur’an, . [inscribed] in a Preserved Tablet.",
86,1,4,"By the heaven and the night-visitor! (al-tdriq actually denotes any thing that comes by night, 
including Stars, because they come out at night). And what will tell you what the night-visitor is? ( mal-tariq is a subject and predicate, Standing 
as the second objedt of [the verb] adra, ‘tell’; and what comes after the firSt ma, ‘what’, is the predicate 
thereof [of this firSt ma]) — this [Statement] emphasises the magnificence of the ‘night-visitor’, which is 
explained in what follows. It is: The piercing, the brilliant, because of its piercing the darkness with its light, Ttar!, meaning [the 
constellation] Pleiades; or [it refers to] all Stars (the response to the oath [follows]): Over every soul there is a keeper (if read la-ma, then ma is extra, and in, is softened in place of 
the hardened form with its subjedt omitted, that is to say, innahu; the lam is [a particle] for separation; if 
read lammd, then in is for negation and lamma means ilia, ‘except that’) — the watcher is an angel that 
keeps a record of its deeds, both the good and the evil.",By the sky and the night comer – . and how do you know what the night comer is? . It is the star of piercing brightness[1] – . there is no soul except that there is a watcher over it.,[1] Whose light pierces through the darkness or through the sky.
86,5,10,"So let man consider, by way of refledtion, from what he was created, from what thing: the response is: He was created from a gushing fluid, gushing forth from the man and the woman 
into the womb, issuingfrom between the loins, of the man, and the breaft-bones, of the woman. Assuredly He, exalted be He, is able to bring him back, to resurredt man after his death; and 
so when he refledts on his origins, he will realise that the One who was able to do this is also able to 
resurredt him, on the day when [all] secrets, the hidden convidtions and intentions of the hearts, are inipetded, 
[when] they are examined and revealed, whereat he, the one who denies resurredtion, will have neither strength, to defend himself 
against chastisement, nor any helper, to avert it from him.","Let man reflect on what he was created from. . He was created from a spurting fluid, . emerging from between the backbone and the ribs[2]. . Indeed, Allah is able to bring him back to life. . On the Day when all secrets will be disclosed[3], . he will then have no power, nor any helper.","[2] Both testes and ovaries are sustained by arteries originating between the backbone and the ribcage. . [3] The secrets will be examined, disclosing the real intentions and faiths people harbored, distinguishing between righteous and evil therefrom."
86,11,17,"By the heaven of returns, [of] the rain that returns time and again, and [by] the earth of fissures. Splitting with [the growth of] vegetation, assuredly it, the Qur’an, is a decisive word, distinguishing between truth and falsehood, and it is not ajeft, frivolity or falsehood. Indeed they, that is, the disbelievers, are devising a plot, they are preparing plots againSt 
the Prophet (s), and I [too] am devising a plot, drawing them by degrees [towards deStrudtion] from whence 
they know not. So respite, O Muhammad (s), the disbelievers; grant them respite ([reiterated as] an emphasis, 
one enhanced by the use of a different form [mahhil, amhil ]), that is to say, put them off, for a little 
(ruwayda is a verbal noun emphasising the import of the operator, and is the diminutive form of rud 
or irwad, with shortening of final consonant [ruwaydan, ruwayda]). Surely enough God, exalted be He,

words, by the command to fight and Struggle.

Meccan, consisting of 19 verses. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","By the sky and its recurring rain[4], . and by the earth that cracks open [with the sprout of plants], . Indeed, this [Qur’an] is a decisive word, . which is not for amusement. . Indeed, they are devising a plan. . I am too devising a plan. . So bear with the disbelievers, and give them respite for a while[5].","[4] And sun, moon, stars, clouds, heat, etc. . [5] i.e., Do not be in haste in seeking their punishment and destruction."
87,1,5,"Glorify the Name of your Lord, that is, exalt your Lord above what does not befit Him ( ism 
[in isma rabbika, ‘the Name of your Lord’] is extra), the Moil High (an adjedtive qualifying rabbika, 
‘your Lord’), Who created and proportioned. His creature, making it of well-proportioned parts, with¬ 
out irregularities, and Who determined, what He wants, and guided, to what He had determined of good or evil, and Who brought forth the paiture, [Who] caused herbage to grow, then made it, after verdancy, blackened Hubble, desiccated broken chaff.","Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High, . Who created and fashioned in due proportion, . and Who determined [the creation] then inspired them, . and Who brings forth the pasture, . then makes it into withered chaff.",
87,6,13,"We will have you recite, the Qur’an, so that you will not forget, what you recite, except what God may will, that you forget, by abrogating its recitation and its ruling — the 
Prophet (s) used to recite aloud while Gabriel recited, fearing to forget, and so it is as though it was said 
to him, ‘Do not haSten in it; you will not forget and so do not weary yourself by reciting it aloud’; assur¬ 
edly He, exalted be He, knows what is overt, of words and deeds, and what is hidden, of both of these. And We will ease your way to the easy way, the uncomplicated Law, namely, Islam. So remind, admonish by the Qur’an, in case the reminder should be of benefit, to the one whom 
you might remind, the one mentioned in [the following verse] ‘he [who fears] will be reminded’, in other 
words, even if it might not be of benefit, for it is of benefit to some but of no benefit to others. He who fears, God, exalted be He, will be reminded, by it, as in the verse: So admonish by the 
Qur’an him who fears My threat [Q. 50:45]; but the wretched one (al-ashqa means al-shaqi), that is to say, the disbeliever, will shun it, that is, 
the reminder, in other words, he will leave it aside, not looking at it, he who will be roailed in the greater Fire, the Fire of the Hereafter, the lesser fire being that of 
this world; then he will neither die therein, and find res‘1, nor live, a enjoyable life.","We will teach you [the Qur’an], so you will not forget, . except what Allah wills[1], for indeed He knows what is manifest and what is hidden. . We will guide you to the easy way[2]. . So remind, if the reminder should benefit[3]. . He who fears Allah will take heed, . but the wretched will avoid it, . who will enter the Great Fire, . wherein he will neither die nor live.","[1] i.e., except what Allah wills to make you forget for wisdom such as abrogating or replacing a ruling by another. . [2] To the way of Islam which brings about ease in this life and attainment of Paradise in the Hereafter, or will give you opportunities for righteous deeds that lead to Paradise. . [3] Wherever this Qur’an will be heard."
87,14,19,"Successful, winner, indeed is he who purifies himself, [who] cleanses himself by means of [his 
adherence to] faith, and mentions the Name of his Lord, saying Allahu akbar, ‘God is Great’, and prays, the five 
prayers — and such are the concerns of [one working towards] the Hereafter, [concerns] which the Mec¬ 
can disbelievers shun. Nay, but you prefer (or read yu’thiruna, ‘they prefer’) the life of this world, to the Hereafter, whereas the Hereafter, and the Paradise it entails, is better and more lasting. Truly this, the success of those who purify themselves, and the Hereafter being better, is in the

88,1,7,"Has there — [there has] indeed — come to you the tiding of the Envelop er?, the Resurrection, [so 
called] because it ‘envelops’ creatures with its terrors. Some faces on that day — they [faces] are used to represent the individuals in both instances — 
will be humbled, abjeCt, toiling, weary, tired and exhausted from the chains and fetters, roasting (read tasla or tusla ) in a scorching fire, made to drink from a boiling spring, one of extremely hot temperatures. They will have no food except cadus (dan) — a type of thorn plant which no animal grazes on 
because of its vileness — neither nourishing, nor availing againd hunger.","Has there come to you the story of the Overwhelming Event? . On that Day, some faces will be humiliated, . overburdened and weary[1], . as they burn in a scorching Fire. . They will be made to drink from a boiling spring, . and they will have no food except bitter thorny plants, . that neither nourishes nor satisfies hunger.","[1] They will be burdened with the heavy shackles in the Hereafter, or they performed deeds in their worldly life which were bereft of faith or not done for the sake of Allah."
88,8,16,"Other faces on that day will be delicate, fair, pleased by their efforts, in the [life of the] world [expended] in obedience, [pleased] in the Here¬

88,17,20,"Will they, the Meccan disbelievers, not consider, by way of reflection, the camels, how they 
are created? And the heaven, how it was raised? And the mountains, how they were set? And the earth, how it was laid out flat?, and thus infer from this the power of God, exalted be 
He, and His Oneness? The commencing with the [mention of] camels is because they are closer in con¬ 
tact with it [the earth] than any other [animal]. As for His words sutihat, ‘laid out flat’, this on a literal

‘faces’ representing the individuals; for the variant readings see Ibn Mujahid, Qiraat, 68if.

and not a Sphere as astronomers (ahl al-hay’a) have it, even if this [latter] does not contradict any of the 
pillars of the Law.","Do they not reflect on the camel, how it is created; . and the sky, how it is raised high; . and the mountains, how they are firmly set up; . and the earth, how it is spread out?",
88,21,26,"So remind, them of God’s graces and the proofs affirming His Oneness. For you are only 
an admonisher; you are not a taskmaster over them (a variant reading [for musaytir] has musaytir, that is to say, 
[not one who has been] given authority over them) — this was [revealed] before the command to Strug¬ 
gle [againSt the disbelievers]. But he who turns away, [he who] rejecfts faith, and disbelieves, in the Qur’an, God will chaStise him with the greater chastisement, the chastisement of the Hereafter, the lesser 
chastisement being that of this world, that of being killed or taken captive. Truly to Us will be their return, their coming back after death, then truly with Us will lie their reckoning, their requital, which We will never abandon.

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","So remind [O Prophet]; your duty is only to remind; . you are not assigned to compel them. . But whoever turns away and disbelieves, . Allah will inflict upon him the greatest punishment[3]. . Indeed, to Us is their return, . then it is for Us to call them to account.","[3] i.e., the greatest punishment is the Hellfire. The minor punishment includes disasters in worldly life and grave punishment."
89,1,14,"By the dawn, that is to say, [by] the dawn of each day, and [by] the ten nights, the [firSt] ten nights of Dhu 1 -Hijja, and [by] the even, the pair, and the odd (read watr or witr, two [alternative] forms), the single, and [by] the night in motion, falling or receding: Is there in that, oath, an oath for one of sense?, [one of] intellect (the response to the oath has been 
omitted, that is to say, [it is to be understood as something like], la-tu adhdhabunna yd kuffara Makka, 
‘you will assuredly be chaStised O disbelievers of Mecca!’). Have you not seen, [do you not] know O Muhammad (s), how your Lord dealt with c Ad, Iram — these were the former [people of] ‘Ad ( Irama is an explicative supplement or a substitu¬ 
tion, and it is treated as a diptote because it is a proper noun and feminine) — of the towering ones, that 
is to say, the tall ones — the talleSt one among them would reach four hundred cubits — the like of which was not created in the land, in terms of their power of assault and Strength, and Thamud, who hollowed, hewed, the rocks ( sakhr is the plural of sakhra ) in the valley, the 
Wadi al-Qura, [rocks] which they used as dwellings, and Pharaoh, the one of the tent-pegs: he used to faSten four pegs and tie to these the hands and 
feet of those whom he tortured — those who were rebellious, became tyrannical, in the land, and caused much corruption therein?, [by way of] slaying and otherwise. So your Lord poured on them a scourge of chastisement. Assuredly your Lord is ever on the watch, watching over the deeds of servants, nothing of which 
escapes Him, that He may then requite them for these [deeds].","By the dawn, . and the ten nights[1], . and the even and the odd[2], . and by the night when it comes, . are these oaths not sufficient for those who have sense? . Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with ‘Ād . of Iram[3], who were people of great stature, . the like of whom had never been created in the land; . and Thamūd, who carved out the rocks in the Valley; . and the mighty and powerful[4] Pharaoh? . All of them transgressed in the land, . and spread therein much corruption, . so your Lord poured upon them a scourge of punishment. .

89,15,20,"And as for man, the disbeliever, whenever his Lord teSts him and honours him, with wealth and 
other things, and is gracious to him, he says, ‘My Lord has honoured me’. But when he teSts him and restricts his provision for him, he says, ‘My Lord has humiliated me’. No indeed! — a disavowal [of this notion], in other words, honour is not about wealth, nor is 
there any humiliation in poverty, rather it has to do with obedience and disobedience [repetitively]; but 
the disbelievers of Mecca unmindful of this. Rather they do not honour the orphan, they do not treat 
him with kindness, depute their wealth, or [it means that] they do not give him what is his due from an 
inheritance, and they do not urge, neither themselves nor others, the feeding of the needy; and they devour inheritance (turath means mirath ) greedily ( lamman ), that is to say, voraciously, 
when they appropriate ( lammuhum ) the womens and the young ones’ share of the inheritance together 
with their own share of it, or to their own wealth; 


Tafsir al-Jalalayn and they love wealth with abounding love, that is to say, greatly, and so they do not expend [any] 
of it (a variant reading in the case of all four verbs has the second person plural). 1","As for man, when he is tested by his Lord by honoring him and bestowing blessings upon him, he says, “My Lord has [deservedly] honored me[5]!” . But when he is tested by restricting his provision, he says, “My Lord has [undeservedly] humiliated me!” . No indeed[6]! You are not kind to the orphan, . nor do you urge one another to feed the needy, . and you greedily consume the entire inheritance[7], . and love wealth immensely.","[5] Instead of being grateful, he is proud, attributing the favor to his own merit. . [6] It is not as you think. Allah puts people to test through prosperity and hardship and rewards their gratitude and patience in the Hereafter. . [7] Whether lawful or unlawful."
89,21,30,"No indeed! — a deterrent for them from such [conduct]. When the earth is pulverised repeat¬ 
edly, when it is shaken until every edifice has collapsed and is destroyed, and your Lord, that is to say, His command, and the angels arrive rank on rank (saffan saffan is 
a circumstantial qualifier, meaning ‘Standing in rows’ or ‘made up of many ranks’), and Hell on that day is brought [near], pulled by seventy thousand sets of reins, each set of 
reins [pulled] by the hands of seventy thousand angels, as it groans and seethes in fury; on that day 
(yawma’idhin is a substitution for idha, ‘when, the response to which is [the following]) man, that is 
to say, the disbeliever, will remember, his prodigal conduct in it, but how will remembering avail him 
[now]? (the interrogative is meant as a denial, in other words, his remembering that will not be of any 
use to him). He will say, as he remembers: ‘O (yd is for calling attention to something) would that I had sent 
ahead, good deeds and faith, for my life!’, [for] a good [life] in the Hereafter, or [it means] ‘during my 
life’ in the world. Then on that day none shall mete out (read yu'adhdhibu) His, God’s, chastisement, that is to say, 
He shall not delegate it to any other; and, likewise, none shall bind (read yuthiqu) His bind (a variant reading has yuadhdhabu, ‘[none] 
shall be chaStised’, and yuthaqu, ‘ [none] shall be bound’, so that the [suffixed] pronoun of ‘adhabahu and 
wathaqahu refers to the [chastisement and the binds of the] disbeliever, the meaning then being, ‘none 
shall be chaStised as he shall, and none shall be bound as he shall [be bound]’). ‘O soul at peace!, [the one] secure, namely, the believing one. Return — this is said to it upon death — to your Lord, that is to say, return to His command and 
to His will, pleased, with the reward, pleasing, in God’s sight with your deeds; in other words [return O 
soul] combining both descriptions (both of which are circumstantial qualifiers). And it will be said to it 
at the Resurrection: Then enter among My, righteous, servants! And enter My Paradise!’, with them.

sworn and that which is a supplement thereto). And [by] the begetter, that is, Adam, and that which he begat, that is, his descendants (md, ‘that

way to surmount it by saying: the freeing of a slave, from bondage, or to give food on a day of hunger, to an orphan near of kin (maqraba means qaraba), or a needy person in misery (matraba: [literally means] ‘clinging to the dud [turdb]’ because 
of his poverty; a variant reading has two verbal nouns in place of the two verbs [fakka, ‘he freed’, and 
at’ama, ‘he fed’], the fird being in a genitive condru<ftion,/akkn raqabatin, ‘the freeing of a slave’, and the 
second with nunation, it’dmun, ‘to give food’, in which case there is an implied iqtihamu before al-’aqaba,

tion) created the male and the female, Adam and Eve, or every male and female — the hermaphrodite,

a male or a female; [he may do so with a hermaphrodite]. Assuredly your efforts, your deeds, are dissimilar, with some working towards Paradise by means 
of obedience, while others [in effecft] are working towards the Fire through [acfts of] disobedience. As for him who gives, what is due to God, and is fearful, of God, and affirms the truth of the bed [word], that is, [the truth] of‘there is no god but God’ (in both

to enter this fire] constitutes an interpretation of His saying, But He forgives other than that to whomever 
He will [Q. 4:48], which in turn suggests that what is meant is that entry [into the Fire] which will be 
everlasting. The God-fearing one (al-atqa means al-taqi) shall be spared it, he will be removed far away

Sura al-Layl he who gives his wealth to purify himself offering it as a [means of self] purification before God, 
exalted be He, by making this payment for the sake of God, exalted be He, and not for show or the sake 
of reputation, so that he [or the offering] stands purified in the sight of God. This [verse] was revealed 
regarding the truthful one ( al-siddiq ) [Abu Bakr], may God be pleased with him, when he purchased 
Bilal [the Ethiopian], who was being tortured on account of his faith, and then freed him, whereat the 
disbelievers said, ‘He only did this in return for a favour which he [mu£t have] owed him] and so the 
following was revealed: and no one has any favour [outstanding] with him that mu St be requited; but, he did this, only seeking the pleasure of his Lord the Mo St High, that is to say, only seeking 
[to secure] God’s reward; and verily [soon] he shall [himself] be pleased, with the reward he will be given in Paradise. The 
verse applies [equally] to anyone who may do as he [Abu Bakr] did, may God be pleased with him, and 
such [a person] will thereby be removed far from the Fire and rewarded.

Meccan, consisting of 11 verses. 


When this was revealed, the Prophet (s) said Allahu akbar! at the end, and so it became the recom¬ 
mended practice ( sunna ) to say this at the end of it; it is also reported that it [the saying of it] is actually 
enjoined at the end of this [sura] and at the end of every sura henceforth, and that is [to say] Allahu akbar 
or la ilaha illa’Llah wa’Llahu akbar. 


In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","Indeed, it is upon Us to show the right way, . and surely to Us belong the Hereafter and the present life. . So I warn you of a raging Fire, . none will enter it except the most wretched, . who denied and turned away. . But the most righteous will be saved from it, . who spends his wealth to purify himself, . not in return for someone’s favors[2], . but to seek the pleasure of his Lord, the Most High. . He will surely be well pleased.","[2] i.e., not as a repayment for a favor he received."
93,1,5,"By the forenoon, that is to say, the first part of the day or all of it, and [by] the night when it is Hill — or [saja can mean] ‘when it envelops [all] in its darkness’. Your Lord has neither forsaken you. He has [not] abandoned you, O Muhammad (s), nor does He 
hate you: this was revealed when, after the revelation had not come to him for fifteen days, the disbeliev¬ 
ers said, ‘His Lord has parted with him and hates him’. And verily the Hereafter shall be better for you, by virtue of the honours awaiting you thereat, 
than thefirH [life], this world. And verily your Lord shall give you, in the Hereafter, of good things, a bounteous gift, and you 
shall be satisfied, with it — and so the Prophet (s) said, ‘In that case, I shall not be satisfied if a single 
person from among my community remains in the Fire’ (the response to the oath terminates here, with 
two affirmations and two negations).","By the morning sunlight, . and by the night when it covers with darkness[1], . your Lord has neither forsaken you [O Prophet] nor hated you; . the Hereafter is better for you than the present life; . and your Lord will certainly give you so much that you will be well pleased.",[1] And everything becomes still.
93,6,11,"Did He not find you an orphan (an interrogative meant as an affirmative, in other words, He did 
[indeed] find you [an orphan]), having lo£t your father before you were born or [shortly] thereafter, and 
shelter you?, by having your uncle Abu Talib embrace you [as part of his household]. And did He not find you erring, from the [revealed] Law which you [now] follow, and guided 
you?, that is, and then guided you to it. And did He not find you needy, poor, and enrich you?, [and] made you content with the ^Jjoils 
and other things which He gave you — in a hadith [it is stated], ‘Wealth comes not from the proliferation 
of transient [worldly] goods, but wealth comes from the contentedness of the soul’. So, as for the orphan, do not oppress [him], by appropriating his wealth or otherwise, and as for the beggar, do not drive [him] away, [do not] repel him on account of his poverty, and as for your Lord’s grace, to you, byway of prophethood and otherwise, proclaim [it], make 
it known. The omission in certain instances of the [suffixed] pronoun referring to the Prophet (s) from 
the end of the verbs is intended to sustain the end-rhyme of the verses.

Meccan, consisting of 8 verses. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","Did He not find you an orphan then take good care of you? . Did He not find you unguided then guide you? . Did He not find you in need then enrich you? . So do not mistreat the orphan, . nor repulse the beggar[2]; . and proclaim the favors of your Lord[3].","[2] i.e., anyone in need who seeks help. . [3] i.e., be grateful to Allah by proclaiming the favors He has given you."
94,1,4,"Did We not expand (an interrogative meant as an affirmative, in other words, ‘We did [indeed] 
expand’) your bread for you, O Muhammad (s), by means of prophethood and otherwise, and relieve you of your burden, that which weighed down your back? — this is similar to where God says: that God may forgive 
you what is pail of your sin [Q. 48:2]. Did We not exalt your mention? For you are mentioned where I [God] am mentioned in the call 
announcing [the time for] prayer ( adhan ), in the [second] call to perform the prayer ( iqama ), in the 
witnessing [‘there is no god but God, Muhammad is His Messenger’] ( tashahhud ), in the Friday sermon 
and in other instances.","Have We not reassured your heart for you [O Prophet][1], . and relieved you of your burden[2] . that weighed down your back, . and raised high your fame for you[3]?","[1] i.e., enlighten and gladden your heart for receiving the revelation. . [2] forgave your previous or future errors, or relieved you of the anxiety you experienced at the beginning of your mission. . [3] Allah raised the Prophet's name in numerous ways, such as his name is mentioned twice in the call to prayer five times a day, as well the second call to prayer; at the end of each of the five daily prayers; believers invoke Allah’s blessings upon him and his family; and upon reverting to Islam, his name is mentioned, etc."
94,5,8,"For truly with hardship comes ease. Truly with hardship comes ease: the Prophet (s) suffered much hardship at the hands of the disbe¬ 
lievers, but then he enjoyed ease when he was assisted to victory [by God] over them. So when you are finished, from [performing] prayer, toil, exert yourself in supplication 
[to God], and seek, devote yourself humbly to, your Lord.

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","For indeed, with hardship comes ease[4], . indeed, with hardship comes ease. . So whenever you are free[5], strive in worship, . and turn to your Lord in devotion.","[4] In Arabic grammar, if a definite noun is repeated, it is referring to the same thing. However, if an indefinite noun is repeated, it is referring to two different things. So here in this and the coming verse they refer to one hardship (a definite noun) and two eases (an indefinite noun), which manifests Allah's favors upon His servants even in times of hardships. .

95,1,6,"By the fig and the olive, that is, the two [edible] foods — or [these denote the names of] two 
mountains in Syria on which these two foods grow — and [by] the Mount Sinai, the mountain on which God, exalted be He, S]x>ke to Moses (sinin 
means ‘the one blessed’ or ‘the fair one with fruitful trees’), and [by] this secure land: Mecca, as people were secure in it in the time of pagandom and [are 
Still secure in it] in Islam. Verily We created man ( al-insan: the generic) in the bed of forms, [in the beSt] proportioning of 
his shape. Then, in the case of certain individuals of his [Species], We reduced him to the lowed of the low

young; but he will Still have his reward, as God, exalted be He, says: except those who believe and perform righteous deeds, for they shall have an unfailing reward, 
one unending — in a hadith [it is Stated], ‘When a believer reaches that Stage of old age which prevents 
him from performing [good] deeds, then what he used to do is recorded in his favour [instead]’.","By the fig and the olive[1], . and by Mount Sinai[2], . and by this secure city [of Makkah][3], .

[2] Of Egypt. . [3] This passage refers to the land of the three great prophets of Allah: Jesus (ﷺ) lived in the land of figs and olives, Moses (ﷺ) communicated with Allah on Mount Sinai, and Muhammad's (ﷺ) birthplace was Makkah. There is a similar reference in Deuteronomy 33:1, [Moses said:] “The Lord came from Sinai. Rising from Seir upon us, and he shone forth from Mount Paran.” Seir is a mountain near Jerusalem, and Paran is a mountain near Makkah. . [4] i.e., in upright and balanced form and nature. . [5] i.e., to the depths of Hell due to deviation from uprightness; or to decrepit old age."
95,7,8,"So what makes you deny, O disbeliever, thereafter — after the mention of man being created in 
the beSt of forms and his being reduced to the vileSt of age, all of which indicates the power [of God] to 
resurrecft — the Judgement?, the Requital that will be preceded by the Resurrection and the Reckoning. 
In other words, what makes you disbelieve in all this? Nothing does! Is not God the faired of all judges?, the moSt juSt of all judges. His passing judgement by means of 
[the process of] requital is one such example. In a hadith [it is Stated], ‘Whoever recites [surat] wa’l-tini, 
‘By the fig’, to the end of it, let him then say, “Yes Indeed! And I am of those who bear witness to this!” ’ 


[96] al-'Alaq 


Meccan, consisting of 19 verses; from the beginning of it up to [the verse] what he did not know, was the 
firSt of the Qur’an to be revealed, in the cave at Hira’, as reported by al-Bukhari. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","Then, what makes you deny the Judgment Day? . Is not Allah the Most Just of all judges?",
96,1,5,"Recite, bring recitation into existence, beginning with: In the Name of your Lord Who created, 
all creatures; created man (al-insdn: the generic) from a blood-clot (‘alaq is the plural of ‘alaqa, which is a small 
quantity of congealing blood). Recite: (reiterating the firSt one) and your Lord is the MoCt Generous, having no counterpart in 
terms of His generosity ( wa-rabbuka’l-akram is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject [of the 
verb] iqra\ ‘recite’), Who taught, [the art of] script, by the pen — the firSt to write with it was [the prophet] Enoch 
(Idris), peace be upon him — taught man (al-insdn: the generic) what he did not know, before he was taught, in the way of 
guidance, [the art of] writing, crafts and so on.","Read in the name of your Lord Who created, . created man from a clinging clot. . Read, and your Lord is the Most Generous, . Who taught by the pen, . taught man what he did not know[1].","[1] These five verses (1-5) are the first ever verses revealed of the Qur’an. The Prophet (ﷺ) was retreating at a cave in the outskirts of Makkah when the angel Gabriel appeared before him, and ordered him to read. Since the Prophet (ﷺ) was unlettered, he would respond, “I cannot read.” Gabriel would then squeeze him tightly and order him again to read. Ultimately, Gabriel said to him: “Read in the name of your Lord …”."
96,6,8,"Nay, but verily man is [wont to be] rebellious, when he sees it, that is to say, his own soul, to be self-sufficient, in terms of wealth — this was 
revealed regarding Abu Jahl (ra’d, ‘sees’, means [to see] mentally; ifiaghna, ‘self-sufficient’, is the second 
direcft objecft; an ra’dhu, ‘when he sees it’, is an objecft denoting reason). Surely to your Lord, O man, is the return — [meant as] a threat for him — and so He will requite 
the rebellious one with what he deserves.","Indeed, man transgresses . when he deems himself to be self-sufficient. . Indeed, to your Lord is the return.",
96,9,19,"Have you seen ( a-ra’ayta in all three instances [here and below] is an exclamation of wonder) him, 
namely, Abu Jahl, who forbids a servant, namely, Muhammad (s), when he prays? Have you considered what if he, the one forbidden, should be upon [a path of] guidance, or (aw is for division) be bidding [others] to fear of God? Have you considered what if he, the one forbidding the Prophet, shoidd be denying [God’s 
guidance] and turning away?, from faith. Is he not aware that God sees?, what has issued from him, that is to say, He does [indeed] know it 
and will requite him for it. In other words, ‘Marvel, O you being addressed, at the way in which he forbids 
prayer, and at the facft that the one being forbidden is actually the one upon guidance, bidding to fear of 
God, while the one forbidding is a denier, disregarding faith’. No indeed! — a repudiation of him — Assuredly if (la-in: the lam is for oaths) he does not desifi, 
from the disbelief that he is upon, We shall seize him by the forelock. We shall drag him to the Fire by 
his forelock, a lying, iniquitous forelock! (ndsiyatin: an indefinite noun substituting for a definite) — 
the description of this [forelock] in such terms is meant figuratively, and what is actually meant 
is that individual. 


Tafsir al-Jalalayn Let him, then, call upon [the henchmen of] his council, the members of his council ( nadin ) — a 
place of assembly where people gather to talk. He [Abu Jahl] had said to the Prophet (s) in reproof, hav¬ 
ing forbidden him from prayer, ‘You are well aware that there is none in this [town] who has [recourse 
to] as large a council [of men] as I do. Verily, I shall fill this [entire] valley with mature steeds and young 
men [in battle] against you if you so wish!’ We shall call the Zabaniya, the grim £tern angels to destroy him, as [Stated] in the hadith, ‘Had 
he called his council [of henchmen] together, the Zabaniya would have seized him right before his own 
eyes!’. No indeed! — a repudiation of him — Do not obey him, O Muhammad (s) and abandon prayer, 
and prostrate yourself, perform prayer to God, and draw near, to Him through obedience to Him.

this sentence indicates the direct objecft of [the verb] yalamu, ‘ [does he not] know’, that is to say, ‘We will 
requite him at the time mentioned’; khabirun, ‘Aware’, is semantically connected to yawma’idhin, ‘on that 
day’, even though [in faCt] God is ever Aware, because that is the Day of Requital. 


[ioi] al-Qari‘a 


Meccan, consisting of 11 verses. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","indeed, man is very ungrateful to his Lord[5] – . and he himself is a witness to that[6] – . and he is truly extreme in his love of wealth. . Does he not know that when the contents of graves will be overturned, . and the secrets of the hearts will be brought to light[7]? . Indeed, their Lord is All-Aware of them on that Day[8].","[5] disobeying Him by not spending in the cause of Allah from what He has given him and commanded him to spend accordingly. . [6] By his words and actions. . [7] i.e., when all secrets of the hearts and faiths are made known. . [8] Nothing of their affairs will be hidden from Him."
101,1,5,"The Clattering Blow, the Resurrection that will make hearts clatter by its terrors. What is the Clattering Blow? — [intended] to emphasise its awesomeness ( mal-qana : both of 
these [elements] constitute a subject and a predicate, and [together] the predicate of [the firSt] al-qana ). And what will show you, [what] will make known to you, what the Clattering Blow is? — addi¬ 
tional emphasis of its awesomeness (the firSt ma is a subject, and what follows it is its predicate; the sec¬ 
ond ma and its predicate also function together as the second direct object of [the verb] adra, ‘show’). The day ( yawma: that which renders it accusative is [the verb] indicated by al-qana, in other 
words, [by the implied] taqrau, ‘it clatters’) mankind will be like scattered moths, like a throng of scat¬ 
tered locuSts surging into each other in confusion, until they are summoned to the Reckoning, and the mountains will be like tufts of wool, like carded wool in terms of the lightness with 
which it floats [in the air] until it comes to settle upon the earth.","The Striking Calamity! . What is the Striking Calamity? . How do you know what the Striking Calamity is? . On that Day people will be like scattered moths[1], . and the mountains will be like carded wool[2].",[1] After having been thrown out of their graves. . [2] As they disintegrate.
101,6,11,"Then as for him whose scales weigh heavy, in that his good deeds outweigh his misdeeds, he will enjoy a pleasant life, in Paradise, that is to say, a pleasing one, for he will be pleased with 
it, that is, it will be pleasing to him; but as for him whose scales weigh light, in that his evil deeds outweigh his good ones, his home will be the Abyss. And what will show you what it is?, that is to say, what the Abyss is. It is: A scorching fire, of extremely hot temperature (the ha of hiya is for [consonantal] quies¬ 
cence, and is retained when reciting without a [subsequent] pause or with; some omit it when reciting 
without a pause). 


[102] al-Takathur 


Meccan, consisting of 8 verses. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","Then the one whose scales of good deeds are heavy, . will have a pleasant life[3]. . But the one whose scales of good deeds are light, . his abode will be the abyss[4]. . And how do you know what it is? . It is a Blazing Fire.",[3] In Paradise. . [4] Hāwiyah: the pit of Hellfire.
102,1,4,"Rivalry [in worldly things], mutual vainglory about wealth, children and men, diSlrads you, 
preoccupies you [diverting you] from obedience to God, until you visit the graves, [either] in that you have died and then been buried in them, or [it 
means] to the extent that you [actually] count the dead as a something to rival one another by. No indeed! — a disavowal. You will come to know! Again, no indeed! You will come to know, the evil consequences of your mutual vainglory at the 
moment of the extraction [of the soul], then [you will come to know] in the grave.","Competition for worldly gains distracts you [from Allah], . until you come to your graves. . No indeed! You will come to know. . Again no! You will come to know.",
102,5,8,"No indeed! — verily — Were you to know with certain knowledge, the consequences of your 
vainglory, you would not preoccupy yourselves with it, [for] you would surely see hell-fire, the Fire ( la-tarawunna’l-jahima: this is the response to an omitted 
oath; the third consonant of the root of the verb [r-’-y] together with the second have been omitted, and 
its vowel has been transposed onto the ra). Again, you will surely see it — [repeated] for emphasis — with the eye of certainty ( c ayna is a 
verbal noun, as both ra’a and j ayana have the same meaning). Then, on that day, the day you see it, you will assuredly be questioned (la-tus’alunna: the nun 
of the indicative has been omitted because of one nun coming after the other; likewise [omitted] is the 
waw indicating the plural person [of the verb] because of two unvocalised consonants coming together) 
about the comforts [of the world], the health, leisure, security, food, drink and other things which one 
enjoys in this world. 


[103] al-‘Asr 


Meccan or Medinese, consisting of 3 verses. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","No indeed! If only you knew for certain[1]. . You will surely see the Blazing Fire, . Again, you will see it with absolute certainty. .

[2] i.e., of health and wealth and other comforts of the worldly life."
103,1,3,"By Time! — or [it c asr can mean the period] from the declining of the sun to sunset, or [it may 
denote] the afternoon prayer. Verily man (al-insan : the generic) is in [a Hate of] loss, in all his bargaining, except those who believe and perform righteous deeds, they are not in [a State of] loss, and

Meccan or Medinese, consisting of 9 verses. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","By the time, . man is in utter loss, . except those who believe and do righteous deeds, and exhort one another to the truth and exhort one another to patience.",
104,1,9,"Woe ( waylun : an expression implying chastisement) to every backbiter, [who is a] slanderer, 
frequently engaging in backbiting and slander, that is to say, defamation — this was revealed regard¬ 
ing those who slandered the Prophet (s) and the believers, the likes of Umayya b. Khalaf, al-Walid b. 
al-Mughira and others — who amasses (read jamaa or jamma’a) wealth and counts it over, keeping count of it and Stores 
it aside as a provision againSt the [unforeseeable] calamities of time. He thinks, in his ignorance, that his wealth will make him immortal, never to die. Nay! — a repudiation — He will surely be flung ( la-yunbadhanna is the response to an omitted 
oath), that is, he will be hurled down, into the Crusher, that crushes everything that is thrown into it. And what will show you, [what] will make known to you, what the Crusher is? [It is] the fire of God, kindled, set ablaze, which peers over the hearts, to burn them — the pain of which is much more severe than any 
other because of the delicate nature [of the heart]. Lo! it will be closed in (mu’sada or musada) on them (' alayhim, ‘on them: the plural pronoun 
takes into account the [plural] import of kull, every’), in outstretched ( mumaddadatin is an adjedtive qualifying the preceding [noun, ' amadin ]) col¬

Meccan, consisting of 5 verses. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","Woe to every backbiter and slanderer, . who amasses wealth and counts it over and again[1], . thinking that his wealth will make him live forever. . No indeed! He will surely be cast into the Crushing Fire[2], . and how do you know what the Crushing Fire is? . It is the kindled Fire of Allah, . which reaches the hearts[3]. .

105,1,5,"Have you not considered (an interrogative meant to provoke marvel, in other words, ‘marvel 
at’) the way in which your Lord dealt with the Men of the Elephant?, who was named Mahmud, and 
the men were Abraha, King of Yemen and his troops. He had built a church in San'a’ in order to divert 
pilgrims away from Mecca to it. A man from among the Banu Kinana defecated in it and Stained its 
prayer niche with a deflowered virgins blood, in contempt of it. Abraha then swore that he would knock 
down the Ka'ba. So he approached Mecca with his troops riding Yemeni elephants with Mahmud at the 
vanguard. But when they turned to destroy the Ka'ba, God unleashed upon them what He relates in His 
words: Did He not make — that is to say, He did [indeed] make — their Stratagem, to destroy the Ka'ba, 
go aSlray, [ending up] in failure and destruction, and unleashed upon them swarms of birds, [birds] in droves, one following the next (it is said 
there is no singular form for it [abdbil], like asdtir; but some say that the singular is abul or ibdl or ibbil, 
similar [in constructed pattern] to ‘ajul, miftah and sikkin), pelting them with Slones of baked clay, thus making them like devoured blades?, like the leaves of crops which have been consumed, 
trampled and destroyed by animals. God destroyed each one of them with his own Stone, inscribed with 
his name, larger than a lentil [in size] but smaller than a chick-pea, able to pierce through an egg, a man, 
or an elephant and go through the ground. This took place in the year of the Prophets birth (s). 


[io6] Quraysh 


Meccan or Medinese, consisting of 4 verses. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the people of the Elephant[1]? . Did He not turn their scheme into a total loss[2]? . He sent against them swarms of birds, . pelting them with stones of baked clay, . leaving them like chewed-up chaff.",[1] The army of Abrahah al-Ashram was accompanied by a huge elephant who came with the intention of demolishing the Kaʿba. . [2] Leading them to perish.
106,1,4,"[In gratitude] for the security of Quraysh, their security ( ilafihim : repeated for emphasis; it is a verbal noun from [the verb] alafa) for the 
journey of winter, to Yemen, and, the journey, of summer, to Syria, every year: they made use of these 
two journeys to provide for their trade at the Station [of Abraham] in Mecca, in order to attend to the 
House [of God], which was their source of pride; they [Quraysh] were the descendants of al-Nadr b. 
Kinana; let them worship (fa’l-ya’budu is semantically connected to li-ilafi, ‘for the security’, the fa being 
extra) the Lord of this House, Who has fed them against, that is, on account of, hunger and made them secure from, that is, on 
account of, fear: they used to suffer hunger in Mecca due to the lack of crops and they feared the army 
of the Elephant. 


[107] al-Ma'un 


Meccan or Medinese, or half and half; it consists of 6 or 7 verses. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","For the accustomed security of the Quraysh[1], . secure in their winter and summer journeys[2]. . Let them worship the Lord of this [Sacred] House[3], . Who fed them against hunger and made them secure against fear[4].","[1] Allah had given Quraysh the honor of being guardians of the Holy Ka‘bah, which allowed them to travel in peace without fear of being harmed. . [2] i.e., their trading caravans would travel south to Yemen in winter and north to the Levant in summer. . [3] i.e., the Ka‘bah. . [4] The people of Quraysh were blessed with provision and security probably because of the prayer of Abraham. See 14:35-37"
107,1,3,"Have you seen him who denies the Judgement?, the Requital and the Reckoning, that is to say, 
‘Do you know who he is?’ If you do not know him then: That is he (read an implied huwa after the fa [of fa-dhalika]) who repels the orphan, that is to 
say, [who] violently drives him away from what is his due, and does not urge, either himself or others [to], the feeding of the needy, this was revealed re¬ 
garding al-'AsI b. Wa’il or al-Walid b. al-Mughira.","Have you seen the one who denies the Recompense? . Such is the one who repulses the orphan harshly, . and does not urge others to feed the needy.",
107,4,7,"So woe to them who pray, those who are heedless of their prayers, neglectful, delaying them from their appointed times, those who make a pretence, with prayers and otherwise, and deny aid, as [insignificant as] a needle, a hatchet, a cooking pot or a bowl. 


[io8] al-Kawthar 


Meccan or Medinese, consisting of 3 verses. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","So woe to those who pray, . but are heedless of their prayer[1]; . those who only show off, . and withhold even the small kindnesses.","[1] i.e., the hypocrites who do not pray except to show off and others who are heedless to pray at their specified times."
108,1,3,"We have assuredly given you, O Muhammad (s), Abundance — [the name of] a river in Para¬ 
dise and his [the Prophet’s] pool around which his community shall gather; al-kawthar also means the 
abundant good [that has been given to the Prophet], such as prophethood, the Qur’an, intercession, and 
the like. So pray to your Lord, the prayer of the Festival of Immolation (‘id al-nahr), and sacrifice, 
your offering. Indeed it is your antagonist, your hater, who is the severed one, refraining from all [acfts of] 
good, or the one whose line of offspring will be severed [by his not having any]: this was revealed regard¬ 
ing al-'AsI b. Wa’il, who called the Prophet (s) al-abtar, ‘the severed one’, when his son al-Qasim died. 


[109] al-Kafirun 


Meccan or Medinese, consisting of 6 verses; this was revealed when a band of idolaters said to the 
Prophet (5), ‘What if you worship our gods for one year, and we worship your God the next?’ 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","We have surely given you [O Prophet] al-Kauthar [i.e., abundance][1], . so pray and offer sacrifice to your Lord alone. . Indeed, the one who hates you is truly cut off [from all goodness][2].","[1] i.e., abundance, of which is the river of al-Kauthar in Paradise. . [2] Both in this world and in the Hereafter."
109,1,6,"Say: ‘O disbelievers! I do not worship, at present, what you worship, of idols, and you do not worship, at present, what I worship, and that is God, exalted be He, alone, nor will I worship, in the future, what you have worshipped, nor will you worship, in the future, what I worship: God knew that they would never become 
believers (the use of [the inanimate] ma, ‘what’, to refer to God is meant to counter [the reference to 
‘what thing’ they worship]). You have your religion, idolatry, and I have a religion’, Islam: this was [revealed] before he was 
commanded to wage war [againSt the idolaters] (all seven Qur’anic readers omit the ya of the genitive 
possessive con£trucftion [in wa-liya dini\ whether with a pause or without; Ya'qub, however, retains it in 
both cases). 1 


Cf. Ibn Mujahid, Qiraat , 699b 


[no] al-Nasr 


This was revealed at Mina during the Farewell Pilgrimage, hence it is considered Medinese: it was the la^t 
sura to be revealed; it consists of 3 verses. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","Say, “O disbelievers, . I do not worship what you worship, . nor do you worship what I worship. . Never will I worship what you worship, . nor will you ever worship what I worship. . You have your religion and I have my religion.""",
110,1,3,"When the help of God, for His Prophet (s), against his enemies, comes together with vidory, the 
victory over Mecca, and you see people entering God’s religion, that is to say, Islam, in throngs, in large droves, after 
they had been entering one by one — this was after the conquest of Mecca, when the Arabs from all 
corners of the land came to him willingly [in obedience to his command] — then glorify with praise of your Lord, that is, continuously praising Him, and seek forgive¬ 
ness from Him; for verily He is ever ready to relent. The Prophet (s), after this sura had been revealed, 
would frequently repeat the words subhana’Llahi wa bi-hamdihi, ‘Glory and praise be to God’, and 
adaghfiru’Lldha wa-atubu ilayhi, ‘I seek forgiveness from God and I repent to Him’; with [the revelation 
of] this [final sura] he realised that his end was near. The vicftory over Mecca was in Ramadan of year 8; 
the Prophet (s) passed away in Rabf I of the year 10. 


[m] Tabbat (or al-Masad) 


Meccan, consisting of 5 verses. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful: 

When the Prophet (s) summoned his people and said, ‘I am a warner to you, [Standing] before a ter¬ 
rible chastisement’, his uncle, Abu Lahab, said, ‘May you perish! Is that what you have called us out for?’, 
whereupon the following was revealed:","When there comes Allah’s help and the conquest[1], . and you see people entering Allah’s religion in multitudes, . then glorify the praise of your Lord, and ask His forgiveness. Indeed, He is ever Accepting of Repentance.","[1] i.e., the conquest of Makkah."
111,1,5,"Perish, ruined be, the hands of Abu Lahab, in other words, all of him — the use of ‘hands’ 
here to denote [all of] him is figurative, and is because moSt actions are performed by them; the State¬ 
ment is an invocation — and perish he!, may he be ruined! (this [tabba] is a predicate, as where one 
says, ahlakahu’Llahu wa-qad halak, ‘God destroyed him and he indeed is destroyed’. When the Prophet 
threatened him with the chastisement, he said, ‘If what my brother’s son says is true, then I shall ransom 
[myself] from it with my wealth and sons!’; so the following was revealed: His wealth will not avail him, nor what he has earned ( wa-kasab means wa-kasbihi, that is to 
say, his sons; ma aghnd means [ ma ] yughni). He will [soon] enter a Fire of flames, that is to say, [a fire that is] flaming and ignited (this [State¬ 
ment] is the source of his nickname, [which was given to him] on account of his flaming reddish fair 
face), an d his wife ( wa’mra’atuhu is a supplement to the person [of the verb] yasld, ‘he will enter’, sepa¬ 
rated by the clause of the direcft object! and its qualification) — and this was Umm Jamil — the carrier 
(read hammalatu or hammalata) of firewood, cacftus and thorns which she used to fling into the path of 
the Prophet (s). with a rope of palm-fibre around her neck (fi jidiha hablun min masadin is a circumstantial 
qualifier referring to hammalata’l-hatab, which in turn is [either] a description of imra’atahu, ‘his wife’, 
or the predicate of an implied subject). 


[ii2] al-Ikhlas 


Meccan or Medinese, consisting of 4 or 5 verses. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful: 

The Prophet (s) was asked about his Lord and the following was revealed:","May the hands of Abu Lahab[1] perish, and may he perish! . Neither his wealth nor his worldly gains will avail him. . He will burn in a Flaming Fire, . and so will his wife[2], the carrier of firewood, . around her neck will be a rope of palm fiber[3].","[1] i.e., the Prophet's uncle, who was one of the staunchest enemies of Islam. . [2] i.e., ’Um Jamīl, who used to throw thorny branches in the Prophet's way and she used to slander him (ﷺ). The word hatab (firewood) was used by the Arabs to allude to slander and backbiting. . [3] This surah was one of the earliest surahs revealed in Makkah, yet Abu Lahab persisted in disbelief. For him to disprove the Qur’an, all he had to do was to accept Islam, for the Qur’an condemned him to Hell."
112,1,4,"Say: ‘He is God, One (Allahu is the predicate of huwa, ‘He is’, and ahadun is its substitution or a 
second predicate). God, the Self-Sufficient, Besought of all (Allahu’l-samad constitute a subject and a predicate) 
[al-samad means] the One Who is always sought at times of need, He neither begot, for no likeness of Him can exist, nor was begotten, since createdness is pre¬ 
cluded in His case. Nor is there anyone equal to Him’, neither match nor comparison (lahu, ‘to Him’, is semantically 
connected to kufuwan, ‘equal’, but precedes it because it is the objecft of the intended negation; ahadun, 
‘anyone’, which is the subjedt of yakun, ‘is there’, has been placed after the predicate of the latter [kufuwan, 
‘equal’] in order to retain the harmony of the end-rhyme [of the verses]). 


[113] al-Falaq 


Meccan or Medinese, consisting of 5 verses. 

This sura and the next one were revealed when Labid the Jew placed a SJ>ell on the Prophet (s) using a 
String with eleven knots. God informed him of this and of its place, and so it was brought before the 
Prophet (s) and he was commanded to ‘seek refuge [in God]’ by means of these two suras; and so each 
time he recited a verse from them, a knot would become undone and he would sense an alleviation, until 
in the end all the knots had been undone and he Stood up invigorated, as if he had previously been hob¬ 
bled to the ground. 


In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","Say: “He is Allah, the One[1]; . Allah, the Eternal Refuge[2]. . He neither begets nor is He begotten, . and there is none comparable to Him.”[3]","[1] He is Alone, without a partner, indivisible and distinct from all else. The only true deity, unique in His essence, attributes, and actions. . [2] He is absolute, perfect, complete, self-sufficient; the one eternally and constantly required and sought; all existence depend upon Him; all matters ultimately return to Him. . [3] The Prophet (ﷺ) says that reading this surah (surat al-Ikhlās) equals reading one third of the Qur’an. [Al-Bukhāri and Muslim]"
113,1,5,"Say: ‘I seek refuge in the Lord of the Daybreak, the morning, from the evil of what He has created, of obligated animate beings and non-obligated ones and 
from all inanimates, such as poison and so on; and from the evil of darkness when it gathers, that is, [from] night when it becomes dark and 
the moon when it is absent, and from the evil of the women-blowers, sorceresses who blow, on knots, which they knot into 
Strings, blowing into them [certain] words, but without Spittle; however, al-Zamakhsharl says, ‘with this 
[Spittle]’ — [sorceresses] such as the daughters of the said Labid — and from the evil of an envier when he envies’, [when] he manifests his envy and behaves in ac¬ 
cordance with it — such as the mentioned Labid from among the Jews who were envious of the Prophet 
(s); the mention of these three [elements of evil] which are [already] subsumed by [the Statement] ‘of 
what He has created’, is because of the severity of their evil. 


[114] al-Nas 


Meccan or Medinese, consisting of 6 verses. 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:","Say, “I seek refuge with the Lord of the daybreak, . from the harm of all what He has created; . from the harm of darkening [night] when it spreads around, . from the harm of the sorceresses[1] who blow on knots, . and from the harm of the envier when he envies.""","[1] i.e., magicians."
114,1,6,"Say: ‘I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind, their Creator and their Possessor: they [mankind] 
have been singled out for mention here in order to honour them, and a preface to seeking refuge from 
the evil of the one who whiskers in their hearts; the King of mankind, the God of mankind (both [maliki’l-nds and ildhi’l-nds ] are either substitutions or adjectival 
qualifications or explicative supplements; the repetition of the annexed word [al-nds] is meant as an ad¬ 
ditional explication), 

[ 114:4] from the evil of the slinking whimperer, Satan — he is referred to by the name of the action [was- 
wasa ] on account of his repeated engaging in it — who slinks [away] and recoils from the heart whenever 
God is mentioned,  who whimpers in the breasts of mankind, in their hearts — whenever they negleCt to 
remember God, of the jinn and mankind’ (mina’l-jinnati wa’l-ndsi: an explication for the whispering Satan being 
of the jinn and [also] of the humans, similar to Gods saying, the devils of humans and jinn [Q. 6:112]; or, 
mina’l-jinnati, ‘of the jinn’, is an explication for him [Satan], wa’l-ndsi, ‘and [of] mankind’ being a sup¬ 
plement to al-waswds, ‘the whisperer’). Both [explanations] apply to the evil of the mentioned Labid and 
his daughters; the objection to the firSt opinion is that humans do not ‘whiter’ in the hearts of [other] 
humans, but that it is the jinn who whiter in their hearts: I would reSjiond by saying that human beings 
also ‘whiter’ in a manner appropriate to them, [beginning] externally, whereafter their whiners reach 
the heart and establish themselves in it in the way in which this [customarily] happens. But God knows 
beSt what is correct, and to Him shall be the return and the final destination, and may God bless our lord 
Muhammad and his Family and Companions, and grant [them all] much peace, forever and always. God 
suffices for us and [what] an excellent guardian [is He]! And there is no power or might except in God, 
the Sublime, the Tremendous.

[2] Which disappears when one remembers Allah. . [3] Evil prompters and whisperers can be from jinn or from men."
